The secondary outcome was to explore indicators of the intervention&#8217;s effectiveness using quantitative data from patient reported outcome measures (acceptability questionnaire and satisfaction with decision scale) and qualitative data from patient and clinician interviews.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>21 patients were approached to take part in the study, 20 were recruited with a mean age of 32.2 (SD 9.7), 40% were female. The recruitment rate was 95.2%, fidelity of intervention 100%, acceptability 94% and follow-up questionnaire completion 100%. The mean overall satisfaction with decision scale score was 24.85/30 (SD 3.82). There were no adverse events. Data from qualitative interviews with patients (n=5) and physiotherapists (n=5) suggested the SDM was acceptable and appeared effective in: (1) supporting decision-making about treatment, (2) conversations between patients and clinicians, (3) improving patient knowledge, (4) providing patients with access to health language and (5) supporting patients to ask questions deemed important to them.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The novel SDM intervention is acceptable to both patients and physiotherapists. Indicators of effectiveness explored through quantitative and qualitative data suggest the intervention to be beneficial to decision-making processes for patients and clinicians deciding on treatment following an ACL rupture. All four feasibility outcomes were achieved, indicating a full trial is feasible to run in the NHS.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link xlink:href="ISRCTN17801081" ext-link-type="isrctn" specific-use="clinicaltrial none">ISRCTN17801081</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Orthopedics</kwd><kwd>Decision Making</kwd><kwd>Feasibility Studies</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UK Department of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIHR302104</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>This feasibility study successfully used a mixed-methods approach to understand feasibility, acceptability and indicators of effectiveness of the novel shared decision-making intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Qualitative interviews supported deeper exploration among patients and physiotherapists in addition to providing further context to quantitative data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This was a single site study and so feasibility and individual experiences at other National Health Service trusts may differ and warrant further exploration.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p> Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures affect over 20&#8201;000 individuals in the UK each year.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 2</sup></xref> Three randomised controlled trials have compared surgical and non-surgical management for patients following acute and non-acute ACL rupture and report conflicting findings.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Given the uncertainty of the evidence base, it is not unexpected that patients also report confusion and ambiguity regarding decision-making about their choice of treatment.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> A UK qualitative study (n=18) exploring the experiences of patients on the surgical pathway found patients to describe the decision-making process in three ways. First, some participants reported to have felt the decision about treatment was made for them with limited opportunity to be involved in the decision-making process. Second, other participants reported a desire to avoid responsibility for deciding on treatment and preferred to defer responsibility to an experienced clinician. Finally, participants described being presented with unbalanced information regarding treatment and felt there was no decision to be made as advice favoured surgical intervention to support a return to physical activity/sport. This left them with little choice but to opt for surgery.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Decision-making in healthcare is multifactorial and a patient&#8217;s motivation to be involved in the process is complex.

Data pertaining to implementation factors were mapped onto a second matrix underpinned by the ENPT (reported in a separate publication). Following mapping, data were then organised into two broad topics. Topic 1 (explored in this paper) included three themes derived from the five overarching headings in Matrix 1: acceptability of the intervention, indicators of effectiveness and trial procedures (including feasibility). Topic 2 (explored in a separate publication) reports implementation of the intervention and considerations for future implementation and normalisation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>Patients and key stakeholders (including orthopaedic surgeons, therapy managers and therapists) with experience of sustaining an ACL rupture, treating patients following rupture or managing departments where patients seek treatment following an ACL rupture were involved in the grant funding application, study design and set-up.

Demographic data of the patient and physiotherapist participants is shown in <xref rid="SP7" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 7</xref>. Interview data are described in relation to three themes exploring: (1) acceptability of the intervention, (2) indicators of effectiveness, and (3) feedback of trial procedures.</p><sec id="s3-3-1"><title>Theme 1: acceptability of the intervention</title><p>The SDM intervention was positively received by patients and physiotherapists and overall deemed to be acceptable with respect to its content and delivery. Patients reflected positively on the intervention&#8217;s length, colour scheme, font size, level of detail, medical language and lay terminology used, paper quality and availability of the paper and online version. Participants suggested that the intervention struck an appropriate balance of offering relevant information without excessive, lengthy and confusing medical detail (Quote 1, <xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 8</xref>). Two participants explained to be disappointed by some data as most expected the outcomes of surgery to be higher than that reported in the literature. However, they went on to reflect positively about their inclusion as it offered transparency of outcomes for the available treatment options (Quote 2, <xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 8</xref>).</p><p>Both patients and physiotherapists reflected positively on the timing of intervention delivery, with patients highlighting the value of its provision at the point of diagnosis, followed by an appointment where it was expected to be discussed. Patients reported that this allowed time to process the information and consider relevant questions. All participants felt that the physiotherapist was an appropriate healthcare professional to be discussing decision-making about treatment with (Quote 3, <xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 8</xref>). One patient reflected on the importance of the healthcare professional to be interested in the area and not &#8216;just going through the motions&#8217; (0012, patient), with another commenting on their preference for delivery by a &#8216;knee specialist&#8217; (0009, patient). One participant suggested a one-to-one appointment may not be necessary. They felt the SDM intervention contained sufficient detail to support decision-making about treatment, particularly where ACLR was seen to be inevitable for young patients looking to return to high-level cutting and pivoting sports.</p><p>Physiotherapists reported the intervention to be acceptable, describing it to be non-burdensome, compatible with usual practice, low risk and within the scope of a qualified physiotherapist&#8217;s skillset. The intervention was low/minimal cost to participants apart from the time taken to engage with it, which was reported to be acceptable. One therapist reflected on the increased time of a 60-min appointment allowing for more in-depth conversations, which was preferred to 30&#8201;min. In contrast, some physiotherapists felt the intervention supported a reduction in consultation time.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-2"><title>Theme 2: indicators of effectiveness</title><p>The SDM intervention was reported to add value in several areas of practice by both patients and physiotherapists. Patients described the intervention to increase their knowledge of the injury and the treatment options available to them which supported them to engage in decision-making (Quote 4, <xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 8</xref>). In contrast, one participant reflected on the lack of compelling evidence available and reported in the SDM intervention and suggested this added difficulty to the decision-making process (Quote 5, <xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 8</xref>). Inclusion of the statistical data was seen to add value. It was viewed as evidence-based and relevant to what happens in real life. Several patients commented on the use of statistics to support an individual assessment of the pros and cons of treatment, in line with what was important to them (Quote 6, <xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 8</xref>). Physiotherapists also reported the level of detail, statistical data and information included in the intervention to be appropriate, relevant and useful. They reflected that, without the intervention, they would not have been able to offer the same level of evidence-based information as keeping up-to-date with the literature is challenging in the current NHS climate (Quote 7, <xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 8</xref>).</p><p>The intervention was also described to support communication between patients and physiotherapists. Further, all patients reported to use the intervention outside of the trial, with friends, family members, healthcare professionals and employers to help communicate their injury and gain support to manage its consequences. Both physiotherapists and patients deemed the intervention to be trustworthy as it was derived from research and included references to the literature that were easy to locate should participants want to seek further information. As a result, some patients suggested to have not needed to conduct internet research to understand their injury further, saving them time from reading (or watching) unwanted levels of detail (Quote 8, <xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 8</xref>). Physiotherapists further reported the intervention to have supported &#8216;buy in&#8217; from patients, who were perceived to have increased knowledge of their injury and treatment options available to them. They felt the intervention offered a good foundation level of knowledge for patients which supported a more pragmatic appointment that was structured, streamlined and tailored to each individual (Quote 9, <xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 8</xref>). This was also mirrored by patients who reported the interventions&#8217; value in providing them with access to healthcare language. Patients reflected on their &#8216;non-medical background&#8217; and explained that the intervention increased their understanding of appropriate terminology, allowing them to have individualised conversations with healthcare professionals and ask important questions relevant to them (Quote 10, <xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 8</xref>).</p><p>In addition, physiotherapists described the role of the intervention in empowering patients to be involved in their care. They felt this enabled a greater sense of control and increased patients&#8217; motivation as they were perceived to have higher accountability for the treatment and its outcomes. They reflected on the interventions presentation of information and felt it was fair and balanced towards both treatment options, ensuring it was effective for use with all patients following an ACL rupture. Physiotherapists further described the interventions utility in supporting their skills to deliver evidence-based information and have SDM conversations with patients. This was reflected by physiotherapists in relation to patients following an ACL rupture, but also for patients with other musculoskeletal/orthopaedic conditions as part of usual practice as opposed to randomised controlled trial (RCT) type practice. They explained to feel more confident to take part in SDM and explore patient views about treatment (Quote 11, <xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-3"><title>Theme 3: trial procedures</title><p>Both patients and physiotherapists had a positive attitude towards participating in the feasibility study. Patients reflected on the low burden of engagement with the intervention, completing baseline data collection and PROs electronically in person or via mobile and email links. Three areas identified by physiotherapists for future trial refinement included, use of drop-in sessions for training refreshers (although not favoured by all), a QR code to access the clinician resources page on the website (replacing access via a password which was or could be forgotten) and a reminder/checklist of key intervention components to be embedded within a patient&#8217;s electronic record. Physiotherapists reported the use of a &#8216;study champion&#8217; and availability to email and receive a prompt response from a member of the research team to have been successful during the feasibility study and should be incorporated into a future main trial to support delivery.</p><p>Future contamination factors were also explored with physiotherapists. When asked about the delivery of usual care in parallel to the SDM intervention (as part of an effectiveness trial), they expressed perceived difficulty with doing so given the new knowledge obtained from the SDM intervention. They favoured a design where treatment would be delivered for one intervention arm only. This is an important consideration and reflection given some therapists had also already begun using the intervention, or elements of it, in their usual practice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Shared decision-making intervention refinements</title><p>As a result of participant feedback during interviews, the following refinements were suggested: (1) additional information to be added about the use of braces for non-surgical management of ACL ruptures, and where to purchase from (2) a prompt for clinicians to review MRI scan results with patients, (3) greater detail about physiotherapy treatment, (4) signposting for local mental health services, (5) additional detail about the surgical procedure and potential additional procedures, for example, tenodesis, (6) adding an arm to the spider diagram to prompt patients to ask &#8216;will I need to stop taking my other medication&#8217; and (7) addition of statistical data reporting patient satisfaction following surgical or non-surgical treatment. One participant suggested deleting the information about ACL self-healing as there was not enough research to support its inclusion.</p><p>These suggestions were discussed at Trial Management Group (TMG) meetings to support refinement of the intervention and its logic model (Implementation Research Logic Model, IRLM). It was agreed that the following components were added as they were deemed to add value to the intervention while ensuring it remained concise and maintained the principles and design of the original content. The following amendments were made: (1) a prompt for signposting to local mental health services was added to the information about psychological factors (option grid, &#8216;what else can I do?&#8217;, page 2), (2) the question &#8216;will I need to stop taking my medication?&#8217; was added under the question &#8216;how will treatment impact my life? (patient information leaflet, spider diagram, page 8) and (3) satisfaction with treatment data was added (patient information leaflet, page 5).

All four feasibility outcomes were achieved, with success rates ranging from 94% to 100% across the outcomes. Indicators of effectiveness suggest the intervention&#8217;s potential utility in supporting SDM processes for treatment decision-making following an ACL rupture. A full trial exploring the effectiveness of the SDM intervention is feasible.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Feasibility and acceptability</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Recruitment rate</title><p>The overall recruitment rate of 95.2% was achieved ahead of schedule within 4&#189; months. This is encouraging and suggests patients are willing to consent to participate in a trial of this nature. During qualitative interviews, patients and physiotherapists reflected on the low burden of the intervention, timing at which it was delivered and appropriateness for a wide scope of patients following ACL rupture as eligibility criteria allowed for inclusion of participants with both acute and chronic ACL ruptures aged 18 and older. These factors likely aided recruitment and so a similar strategy in a future trial is warranted. It is, however, important to highlight the high recruitment rate in the context of other musculoskeletal and orthopaedic research which is typically less than 50%.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18 19</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Fidelity to the intervention</title><p>Fidelity of intervention delivery was 100% for all 11 physiotherapists involved in the study. Ahead of a participants&#8217; appointment, physiotherapists&#8217; were sent an email reminder of key procedures, likely contributing to high fidelity. Fidelity was assessed via a self-reported checklist by the treating physiotherapist; however, this was not externally verified for accuracy. Observation of consultations in a future study would offer clarity regarding fidelity of delivery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Acceptability of the intervention</title><p>Overall acceptability was 93.67% across the 15 items in the acceptability questionnaire. A recent study exploring patient acceptability of a decision aid following Achilles tendon rupture (n=13) reported similar positive responses among patients regarding acceptability.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> This suggests patients following a musculoskeletal/orthopaedic injury respond well to interventions supporting SDM and demonstrates appetite for future research in this area. A key prerequisite to decision-making, and essential to SDM, is to ensure that patients are aware of the treatment options available to them.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> In this study, 100% of patients felt &#8216;the presentation of information was &#8216;balanced&#8217; and fair towards each treatment option&#8217;. However, the lowest scoring question at 80% was that &#8216;the presentation of information seemed in favour of having surgery&#8217; which conflicts with the previous response. Interviews with patients revealed that although participants viewed the wording to be balanced, they felt research available to support a decision to proceed non-operatively was lacking. In addition, some participants described consultations which lacked clinical equipoise leaving patients uncertain about the validity of non-operative treatment. Similar to the previously discussed point, observation of consultations in a future trial may offer greater depth to the presentation of equipoise and impacts on SDM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Follow-up questionnaire completion</title><p>Follow-up outcome measure completion was 100% with acceptability of online methods via text and email links. Participants received a &#163;20 voucher of their choice on receipt of questionnaire responses which may have contributed to the high response rate. During patient interviews, participants stated that the questionnaires were not burdensome, were relevant and easy to complete following the hyperlinks sent via text or email.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Indicators of effectiveness and qualitative exploration</title><p>Although it was not the focus of the feasibility study to determine effectiveness (nor was it powered to do so), the SWD scale was used to explore indicators of the intervention&#8217;s effect on decision-making processes. The average SWD score was 24.85 (95% CI 23.06 to 26.64, SD 3.82). Only one participant &#8216;disagreed&#8217; with one statement regarding being adequately informed but did not respond to an interview invitation, limiting further exploration. Interviews with another participant, who indicated &#8216;neither agree nor disagree&#8217; with the same statement suggested this was due to limited information available in the literature about the non-operative treatment pathway (as discussed above). As this study was with a small number of participants, this will be an important avenue to consider in a future larger trial to understand potential unmet needs.</p><p>Patients reflected on the intervention&#8217;s utility in providing them with access to healthcare language and the subsequent ability to ask questions deemed relevant to them. NHS England outlines current literacy levels in the UK as a crisis impacting on people&#8217;s health.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> In England, a 2018 survey revealed 16.4% of the population to have poor literacy skills, defined as reading at or below the level of a 9-year-old.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> A further 43% are thought to not understand written health information, with this rising to 60% when numbers and statistics are included.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22 24</sup></xref> The inclusion of statistical data was viewed favourably by both patients and physiotherapists and there was no significant difference in outcomes for those identified to be at risk of poor health literacy. Assessing health literacy is an important element of a future trial to further understand the utility of the intervention in those with lower health literacy and levels of education.</p><p>There was some evidence of uncertainty with decision-making about treatment. One participant reported difficulty with the lack of clarity offered by the statistical data included in the intervention and discussed the challenge of making an informed decision. Uncertainty with decision-making in usual care following an ACL rupture has previously been reported, in addition to uncertainty with the non-operative treatment pathway.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6 25</sup></xref> It is unknown how the participant in this feasibility study would have experienced the usual care pathway and whether the intervention had no effect on, introduced or added to existing uncertainty. Evidence from other patients suggested that the intervention did not introduce doubt, but instead offered transparency to the treatment pathway which was reflected on positively. Although previous research has identified most patients value the opportunity to be involved in decision-making, some may require more support and greater time for this process than others.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26 27</sup></xref> The patient demonstrating uncertainty with decision-making in this study identified that they were likely to have responded differently (and more positively) to the follow-up questionnaires (acceptability and SWD) had they have been given more time to engage with the intervention before appraising it. Participation in decision-making has been associated with improved health outcomes and overall greater satisfaction with the consultation process.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28 29</sup></xref> Understanding change in SWD scores over time and in relation to specific points of interaction may therefore be important components of a future trial.</p><p>Most participants expected the outcomes of ACLR to be better than those detailed in the intervention. This expectation has previously been reported in an Australian cohort study, where only 24% of patients had returned to their pre-injury level of sport at 1&#8201;year despite 91% expecting to when asked preoperatively.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> A 2023 predictors review identified patients&#8217; positive estimation of their ability to return as a predictor of a successful return to physical activity.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> However, it was highlighted that clinicians should take caution to ensure patients&#8217; expectations are not enhanced above levels that are realistic. This is an important role of the SDM intervention, with evidence from this study that engagement offered a pragmatic view of treatment outcomes that would have otherwise been assumed to be higher.</p><p>Clinician time constraints have previously been identified as a major barrier to implementing SDM.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> A 2016 knee osteoarthritis SDM study reported no difference in overall consultation time when using an option grid compared with usual care.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> One therapist with experience of a 30-minute and 60-minute consultation in the present study acknowledged that while 60&#8201;minutes was preferred, delivery was achievable within 30&#8201;minutes. Reports from both patients and physiotherapists confirmed low burden of the intervention with no perceived negative effects to consultation time. This suggests that the intervention was appropriate for use during usual physiotherapy practice. One patient participant felt SDM was not prioritised by the physiotherapist due to time constraints. Exploration in a future full trial would confirm the intervention&#8217;s effectiveness in supporting SDM processes, how it is prioritised by clinicians and its impact on consultation length.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Strengths, limitations and reflexive considerations</title><p>Data were collected on participants&#8217; ethnicity, recognised in the 2022 (most recent) UK National Ligament Registry (NLR) report as a future priority to support understanding of the epidemiology and outcomes following ACL rupture.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> While we acknowledge the present study included only 20 participants in one area of the UK, capturing this data may support future understanding of the demographics of those with ACL ruptures. Without consistent reporting of ethnic background in the literature, it is unclear whether the findings of this study are transferable to the wider UK ACL rupture population. The population included those from a wide age range, with varying levels of pre-injury and current physical activity, who sustained their ACL rupture via contact and non-contact mechanisms. These demographics would suggest that the study captured an appropriate sample encompassing a range of characteristics representative of the reported adult ACL population in the current literature.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p><p>A second strength of this study is that participants&#8217; level of deprivation, level of education and health literacy were recorded, to support understanding of the SDM interventions utility in those at risk of poorer healthcare experiences and outcomes. While no significant differences were detected between groups, this only offers an indication of the intervention&#8217;s utility in SDM process as the study was not powered to detect effectiveness. This is an important area of exploration in a future trial to ensure individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are not at risk of marginalisation from SDM processes. All participants identified to be at risk of poor health literacy declined to be contacted to share their experiences in a qualitative interview. We therefore may not have captured a full range of perceptions and experiences, particularly of those at risk of poor health literacy.</p><p>Although there were provisions in place to recruit non-English speaking participants, none were identified as eligible for the trial. Future consideration to understand how the material may translate into other languages and its utility with non-English speaking participants may therefore be needed.</p><p>Further, the qualitative interviews were carried out by the lead researcher who also identifies as a clinician at one of the physiotherapy departments running the study and who has previously practiced at the second department. The lead researcher has been a member of the clinical team for several years. This may have limited the discussions with physiotherapists who may not have felt comfortable accounting negative experiences to a clinical colleague.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>All four feasibility outcomes were achieved, with success rates ranging from 94% to 100% across the outcomes. This study has demonstrated that implementation of an SDM intervention in the ACL rupture pathway is acceptable to both patients and physiotherapists and can be delivered with high fidelity. Exploring indicators of effectiveness, through quantitative and qualitative data, identified the interventions&#8217; utility in improving patient knowledge, supporting patients to understand medical terminology to formulate clinically relevant questions, facilitating SDM conversations, empowering patients to be involved in decision-making about their treatment and providing up-to-date clinically relevant information for both patients and clinicians. These findings support the need for further evaluation in a definitive trial, given the importance of SDM in ensuring patient-centred care in ACL injury management, as evidence to date highlights that surgical intervention is not necessary for all.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-095189</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s001.doc" id="d67e1242" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP2" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-095189</object-id><label>online supplemental file 2</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s002.docx" id="d67e1247" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP3" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-095189</object-id><label>online supplemental file 3</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s003.pdf" id="d67e1252" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP4" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-095189</object-id><label>online supplemental file 4</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s004.pdf" id="d67e1257" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP5" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-095189</object-id><label>online supplemental file 5</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s005.pdf" id="d67e1262" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP6" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-095189</object-id><label>online supplemental file 6</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s006.docx" id="d67e1267" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP7" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-095189</object-id><label>online supplemental file 7</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s007.docx" id="d67e1272" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP8" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-095189</object-id><label>online supplemental file 8</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s008.docx" id="d67e1277" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP9" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-095189</object-id><label>online supplemental file 9</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s009.pdf" id="d67e1282" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP10" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-095189</object-id><label>online supplemental file 10</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s010.docx" id="d67e1287" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the orthopaedic and physiotherapy departments at the Royal Derby Hospital, Florence Nightingale Community Hospital and Queens Hospital Burton at the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust for their support with running this research study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> HC, Clinical Doctoral Research Fellow, NIHR302104 is funded by Health Education England (HEE)/NIHR for this research project.
