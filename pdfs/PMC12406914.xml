We undertook a scoping review of published literature to explore the potential role of NMPs in increasing cervical screening participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We searched three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL) to identify relevant scientific research articles published between 2016 and 2024 and extracted data using a standardised extraction tool.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our review identified 35 studies (randomised controlled trials (RCTs): n=12, non-RCTs: n=23) from a breadth of geographical and country-level income settings including Australia and New Zealand (n=3), Africa (n=7), Asia (n=4), Europe (n=3) and North (n=15) and South (n=3) America. NMPs in the included studies were community health workers, nurses and midwives; and their key roles involved identifying and recruiting target populations, delivering health education and raising awareness of cervical screening, facilitating self-sampling and providing navigation and follow-up assistance. Most studies included screening participants aged &#8805;30 years, who were underscreened, not pregnant, from ethnic minority populations, and living in rural or remote communities. NMP-facilitated cervical screening interventions were largely feasible and acceptable among target populations. Compared with the standard of care, which did not involve NMPs, NMP-facilitated interventions generally demonstrated an increased uptake of cervical screening in RCTs (n=11 out of 12) with relative increases ranging from 1.11 to 42.73. In four RCTs, where NMPs facilitated self-sampling, cervical screening uptake rates ranged from 32.0% to 81.0%. Most non-RCTs (n=18) involved NMPs in facilitating self-sampling, with screening uptake rates ranging from 9.0% to 100.0%. Key strategies identified were capacity-building of NMPs through training, and employing outreach strategies to reach underscreened women.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>NMPs could play a

The World Health Organization&#8217;s (WHO) global strategy for cervical cancer elimination recommends that, by 2030, each country should achieve a target of 70% of women screened with a high-performance human papillomavirus (HPV) test by age 35 years and again by 45 years, alongside targets for HPV vaccination and treatment.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Despite ongoing efforts to increase participation in cervical screening, worldwide screening coverage is still poor. A recent review of 202 countries and territories estimated that globally, 662&#8201;million (64%) women aged 30&#8211;49 years, had never been screened and 5-year screening coverage in women aged 30&#8211;49 years was only 32%, with substantial disparities between high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (77% vs 24%) and within countries.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>Low cervical screening coverage is attributable to various barriers associated with clinician-based screening including individual-level or sociocultural barriers such as limited knowledge of cervical cancer or screening, fear of screening, embarrassment to undergo screening, lack of family support to undergo screening and health system-related barriers such as lack of access to healthcare and shortage of trained cervical screening providers.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Offering HPV testing on a self-collected vaginal sample (self-sampling) can reduce many of these barriers and has been shown to increase the likelihood of participation in cervical screening for under or never-screened women in both LMICs and HICs.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The WHO cervical screening guidelines suggest that either self-samples or healthcare provider-collected samples can be used for HPV DNA testing.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> As of 2021, HPV self-sampling has been included within national cervical screening recommendations in 17 countries (as one of the primary collection methods in 9 and for reaching underscreened populations in 8) and in a piloting phase in 10 more countries.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Since then, access to HPV self-sampling has increased in several HICs including Australia,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> the Netherlands,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Sweden<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and New Zealand.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Some settings offer self-sampling via mail-out models, others through clinic-based models. Both approaches have limitations: for mail out, these include wastage and associated high costs or relatively low uptake and low follow-up rates of screen positives; while clinic-based approaches are limited by an inability to reach those not attending healthcare settings.</p><p>Prior research has highlighted the pivotal role of non-medical providers (NMPs) (ie, non-physicians) including those with clinical qualifications (eg, nurses, midwives) and without clinical qualifications (eg, community health workers (CHWs)) in improving screening uptake across various cancer types including breast and colorectal cancer by acting as patient navigators or delivering health education,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> with nurses or midwives also contributing through performing clinical examinations.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Integrating NMPs into the delivery of cervical screening interventions, particularly for self-sampling, could be a promising strategy to achieve the WHO&#8217;s 2030 target for cervical screening. This approach could expand access to cervical screening for underscreened individuals, improve equity and also facilitate addressing healthcare workforce shortages. Flexible models involving NMPs could potentially forge a middle path, where clinic attendance may not be required but support and connection to a follow-up pathway are incorporated for those who require it.</p><p>To inform health policy recommendations aimed at improving access to cervical screening, there is a compelling need to map the evidence on the roles that NMPs could play in increasing cervical screening uptake. While a previous scoping review by Donovan <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> and systematic review by Driscoll <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> mainly considered the roles of CHWs in cervical screening within LMICs,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21 22</sup></xref> there still remains a dearth of reviews assessing the roles of all types of NMPs. These include those with or without formal clinical qualifications, in cervical screening across diverse settings, encompassing both HICs and LMICs. We, therefore, undertook a scoping review of published literature to collate the roles of NMPs in increasing cervical screening participation. Specifically, we aimed to summarise the evidence pertaining to the contributions of NMPs and to identify the most effective strategies for enhancing cervical screening participation within target populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Search strategy</title><p>We conducted a scoping review in accordance with the framework proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> First, an initial limited search of MEDLINE (OVID) and Embase was undertaken to identify articles on the role of NMPs in cervical screening to identify relevant keywords and appropriate index terms.

Overall, our scoping review found that involving NMPs in cervical screening interventions was feasible and substantially improved the cervical screening uptake among target populations in both HICs and LMICs, particularly in the context of self-sampling. The roles played by NMPs included identifying and recruiting eligible women, delivering health education and raising awareness, facilitating self-sampling and providing navigation and follow-up assistance. Key strategies identified were capacity-building of NMPs through training, involving bilingual or ethnic-specific CHWs; employing outreach strategies to reach underscreened women; and using culturally and linguistically adapted health educational materials. The lack of retention of CHWs and identifying underscreened groups were reported as key challenges associated with the implementation or scaling-up of NMP-facilitated interventions.</p><p>The findings from our scoping review demonstrate that NMP-facilitated interventions are effective in improving the uptake of cervical screening among target populations in both HICs and LMICs.

Our findings are consistent with and supplement the findings of a 2023 meta-analysis highlighting community mobilisation and outreach efforts as effective strategies for promoting self-sampling participation, when facilitated by NMPs.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr"><sup>64</sup></xref> Prior research across various health services (eg, cancer screening, mental health, maternal and child health nutrition, diabetes and cardiac health) has similarly highlighted the potential of NMP-led interventions in addressing barriers and inequities in the uptake of health services across different settings.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">6265</xref><xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> In particular, CHWs, being community-based and culturally aligned, possess a deep understanding of local needs and barriers and can facilitate direct delivery of screening services to target groups.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr"><sup>59</sup></xref> Despite this potential, CHWs are still a largely unrecognised and underutilised workforce within healthcare systems in many HICs.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr"><sup>65 70</sup></xref> The retention of CHWs within communities is challenging due to not being formally recognised within the health system, as identified in our review. Formalising the roles of CHWs within healthcare systems could be an effective strategy to retain their capacity to improve access and equity in cervical screening programmes in both HICs and LMICs.</p><p>Our scoping review builds on previous work by considering NMPs with clinical qualifications such as nurses and midwives in various roles to enhance cervical screening services. CHWs cannot provide direct clinical care but can offer health promotion or support for cervical screening if referral pathways or clinical support is available. However, nurses or midwives can potentially provide a speculum exam for a clinician-collected sample and perform triage of screen positives, particularly in settings where there is a major shortage of workforce. Integrating different types of NMPs including those with or without clinical qualifications in different roles could be an effective strategy to reach more underscreened populations at both the health facility and community levels, as evidenced in our review where nurses or midwives were primarily stationed at health facilities, and CHWs were operating at the community level. Task shifting or sharing, in this context, could be an effective and pragmatic approach to increase cervical screening uptake mainly in resource-poor settings where there is a continuous shortage of staff in cervical screening services within the health system.<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr"><sup>71 72</sup></xref> In settings with established VIA infrastructure, the existing workforce performing VIA, often nurses or midwives, could be repurposed, given ongoing discussions in LMICs about transitioning from VIA to HPV-based screening.<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr"><sup>73</sup></xref> Future research should evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various task-shifting or sharing models involving NMPs with or without a clinical qualification in cervical screening and also prioritise their abilities, motivation and clarity regarding their tasks.</p><p>Furthermore, as found in our review, capacity-building of NMPs through training is essential to improve their knowledge, self-esteem and motivation, ultimately fostering greater trust and better partnerships with underscreened women. It is important that future NMP-led cervical screening interventions incorporate comprehensive capacity-building components focusing on both technical (including clinical, for nurses and midwives) and interpersonal skills (eg, communication and counselling).</p><p>Our scoping review highlights that offering self-sampling by an NMP can be an effective strategy to connect and reach underscreened women in both HIC and LMIC settings. Initially, self-sampling in HICs was offered only to underscreened women.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> More recently, as evidence has built that PCR-based HPV testing works similarly well on self-collected and clinician-collected samples,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> this has changed in some countries, including Australia,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Sweden<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and the Netherlands.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> New Zealand has offered self-sampling as an equal choice since the inception of its HPV screening programme in 2023.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Delivery models vary; however, some settings use mail-out models while some others involve healthcare providers. For instance, in Australia, cervical screening on a self-sample needs to be ordered by a healthcare professional, but guidelines explicitly allow considerable flexibility in the setting where self-sampling can occur and to develop models of care best-suited for individual communities, potentially involving NMPs.<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr"><sup>74</sup></xref> With the aim of improving the accessibility of screening, Australia&#8217;s national cervical cancer elimination strategy also includes strategic actions to expand who can offer screening and to develop innovative screening models (and scale-up successes).<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr"><sup>75</sup></xref> Further research is needed on strategies that sustain NMP engagement in offering self-sampling in both HIC and LMIC settings, including approaches like remuneration and workforce training. Of equal significance is to undertake qualitative studies with consumers to understand their preferences, the acceptability of NMP-driven self-sampling screening, and how to ensure support is available to connect them to follow-up care particularly when HPV testing is offered at home. Additionally, economic evaluations are also required to assess the impact of NMP-driven self-sampling models on healthcare resources including workforce and budgets.</p><p>At the current time, given the mix of HIC and LMIC studies identified in our review, the most frequently reported role of the NMPs was delivering health education or raising awareness about cervical screening. This accords with previous research across breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening, which demonstrated that NMP-facilitated education was effective in sensitising participants to the importance of screening and improving the uptake of screening services.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref><xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> Appropriate and effective awareness-raising initiatives around cervical screening are paramount, particularly in LMICs, as underscored by a recent systematic review highlighting that a lack of knowledge and awareness of cervical screening and cervical cancer was the most frequent individual-level barrier in LMICs.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Additionally, a further key role of the NMPs we identified was navigation assistance in obtaining screening or assisting women to connect to follow-up care (eg, making an appointment for a colposcopy for screen-positive women). CHWs possess a great ability to be involved in patient navigation by guiding women through the healthcare system, linking them to resources, and facilitating interactions with other healthcare providers.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr"><sup>62</sup></xref> While developing strategies for engaging NMPs in health education or patient navigation initiatives in cervical screening, accessibility in terms of language, literacy and locations for health education delivery or navigation assistance should be carefully considered for target populations, particularly for underserved populations including those living in rural or remote areas. Our review identified several strategies that could address access barriers among underserved or marginalised populations such as employing outreach strategies, using culturally and linguistically adapted health educational materials, and involving bilingual CHWs.</p><p>This area of research is very active, given global investments in cervical cancer elimination, thus it is expected that the literature will continue to grow and evolve, including from several ongoing large-scale initiatives such as the ESTAMPA (EStudio multic&#233;ntrico de TAMizaje y triaje de c&#225;ncer de cuello uterino con pruebas del virus del PApiloma humano; Spanish acronym) study,<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr"><sup>76</sup></xref> SUCCESS (Scale Up Cervical Cancer Elimination with Secondary prevention Strategy) project<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr"><sup>77</sup></xref> and EPICC (Elimination Partnership in the Indo-Pacific for Cervical Cancer) initiative,<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr"><sup>78</sup></xref> which are expected to yield further insights.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Our scoping review includes a wide range of studies (both RCTs and non-RCTs) published between 2016 and 2024, enabling an extensive investigation of NMP-driven cervical screening activities and services in a recent time period in both HICs and LMICs.</p><p>Several limitations of our scoping review should be considered. First, the heterogeneity in the intervention and comparison groups across RCTs included in our review was substantial, with reported effects ranging from little to up to 42 times greater. This underscores the importance of local or contextual factors as the effect may be influenced by delivery models, health system contexts and the effectiveness of standard care. In several studies where the main intervention was self-sampling, the intervention effect likely relates more to self-sampling than to those who offered it. Additionally, given the very different self-collection delivery models (eg, clinic-based collection vs mail-out), it is difficult to disentangle the effect of the delivery model versus the NMP roles. Further studies are needed to understand the distinct role of the NMPs in the context of delivery model variations; however, these studies nevertheless show the strong positive impact of NMP-led interventions.</p><p>As is common in scoping reviews, we did not undertake a formal quality assessment of the studies included in our scoping review. We have not included any grey literature; hence, some relevant information may have been overlooked. Additionally, we restricted our scoping review to articles in English, which may have potentially resulted in missing some relevant articles. Finally, we may have missed some articles beyond our scoping review period; although we focused on the recent time period, in order to focus on activities that would be most relevant in the era of self-sampling.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>NMPs play an important role in cervical screening, particularly in the context of self-sampling, and can increase access and equity in cervical screening. Our scoping review highlights various NMP-facilitated approaches to improve cervical screening participation, which could inform future policy, workforce planning and tailored approaches for communities with screening barriers. Careful planning around the management of screen-positive individuals is required to achieve the full health gains from NMP-facilitated approaches, taking into account the distinct roles of NMPs such as nurses or midwives who work clinically and CHWs who are less embedded in the health system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjgh-2025-019041</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjgh-10-8-s001.docx" id="d67e2068" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Laura Sergeant and Chloe Jennett for providing technical and administrative assistance with this work.
