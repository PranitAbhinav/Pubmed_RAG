Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a secreted trimeric glycoprotein with multiple functions. It can bind to various cell-surface receptors and is downregulated in OA chondrocytes. However, the utility of TSP-1 as a biomarker for OA remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between serum TSP-1 concentration and knee OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p id="Par2">We quantified serum TSP-1 concentrations in mice with post-traumatic OA (PTOA) and age-dependent OA (ADOA) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We statistically analyzed the correlation between TSP-1 concentration and OA severity. Additionally, we generated cartilage-specific TSP-1 knockout mice and assessed TSP-1 concentration in the serum. Finally, we measured the concentrations of TSP-1 in the serum and synovial fluid of patients with OA and conducted statistical analyses to evaluate the correlation between TSP-1 concentration and Outerbridge grading. ROC curve analysis was used to determine the diagnostic value of TSP-1 for OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Serum TSP-1 concentration was reduced in wild-type mice with PTOA or ADOA and negatively correlated with OA severity. In cartilage-specific TSP-1 knockout mice, serum TSP-1 levels were decreased. In patients with OA, serum and synovial fluid TSP-1 levels were reduced and negatively correlated with OA severity. These findings suggest that TSP-1 may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Serum TSP-1 concentration is associated with OA severity in both mice and humans and may serve as a useful diagnostic biomarker for OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12967-025-07022-z.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>TSP-1</kwd><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Biomarker</kwd><kwd>Serum</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China Joint Fund Integration Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>U23A600019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Xiaochun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014718</institution-id><institution>Innovative Research Group Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U21A20353</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Xiaochun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100018561</institution-id><institution>Sichuan Education and Scientific Research Grant Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022-199</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Pengcui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Key R&amp;D Projects in Shanxi Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>202202150401019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Pengcui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common chronic degenerative diseases, characterized by the progressive degradation of articular cartilage, thickening of subchondral bone, and osteophyte formation, ultimately resulting in the loss of joint mobility and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Clinical symptoms include pain, joint effusion, and characteristic radiographic features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Approximately 250&#160;million people worldwide have knee osteoarthritis, with its prevalence significantly increasing with age, particularly among individuals aged over 50 years. Higher incidence rates are observed in females compared to those in males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Globally, OA is a leading cause of disability, ranking 11th among the causes of disability worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. With the aging global population, knee OA is poised to become a prevalent global condition, necessitating effective strategies for identifying and diagnosing early-stage OA to prompt timely intervention.</p><p id="Par6">Currently, the clinical diagnosis and prognostic assessment of OA largely rely on radiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or arthroscopic examination. However, X-rays are insensitive to early-stage OA detection, MRI scans are relatively expensive, and arthroscopic examinations are invasive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These limitations critically impede the timely identification of early OA&#8212;the stage at which interventions are most effective in altering disease progression. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop alternative diagnostic approaches that are sensitive, specific, non-invasive or minimally invasive, and cost-effective. Molecular biomarkers measurable in accessible biofluids, such as serum, hold particular promise in this regard. They offer the potential to detect early biochemical changes before structural damage becomes visible on imaging, thus addressing the limitations of current methods and serving as valuable tools for OA diagnosis and assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">TSP-1 is a secreted trimeric glycoprotein with diverse functions and the ability to bind to various cell surface receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It directly inhibits angiogenesis by blocking endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis and indirectly suppresses angiogenesis by reducing the availability of angiogenic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, TSP-1 regulates extracellular proteases by interacting with cell-surface receptors. Overexpression of TSP-1 in the knee joint has been shown to delay OA progression in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated decreased TSP-1 concentrations in the synovial fluid of patients with OA compared with healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Our previous study revealed that TSP-1 enhances autophagy in cartilage by upregulating HSP27, thereby slowing OA progression. We also observed decreased TSP-1 expression in joint cartilage, synovial fluid, and serum after anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) surgery in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Therefore, we hypothesized that low TSP-1 levels are associated with an increased risk of knee joint OA. In this study, we evaluated whether TSP-1 is decreased in the serum of mice and humans with OA, thereby serving as a potential disease biomarker during the early, asymptomatic stages of joint deterioration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Breeding of mice</title><p id="Par9">The animal protocol for this study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University (Taiyuan, China) (ethical approval code: 2021007) and adhered to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals outlined by the Chinese Council on Animal Research. The mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) barrier facility under controlled environmental conditions, with a 12&#160;h light/dark cycle, regulated temperature, and humidity. They were provided with SPF rodent chow and sterile drinking water ad libitum. Throughout the experimental period, the behavior and health status of the mice were monitored daily, with records maintained every 3 days. Pentobarbital sodium (35&#160;mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) was administered for anesthesia before destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery and blood sampling. Euthanasia was performed using 100% carbon dioxide when the following humane endpoints were reached: (i) rapid weight loss (15&#8211;20% decrease), (ii) anorexia (complete lack of food intake for 24&#8211;36&#160;h), (iii) lethargy (inability to eat or drink independently), and (iv) organ infection (ineffective treatment with penicillin). After euthanasia, death of the mice was confirmed by the absence of breathing, heartbeat, and blink reflex for 2&#8211;3&#160;min. In total, 180 mice were used in this study.

All mice were randomly divided into two groups (random numbers were generated for each mouse in Excel, sorted according to their size, and the top 36 mice were assigned to DMM group and the bottom 36 to Sham group, achieving simple random grouping): the DMM group (undergoing medial meniscus instability surgery, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;36) and Sham group (undergoing joint capsule incision surgery, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;36). The specific steps for DMM surgery were as follows. Prior to surgery, each mouse was anesthetized and placed in a supine position. A medial incision was made on the right hind limb, and the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and joint capsule were sequentially dissected to expose the knee joints. The knee joint was flexed to expose and release the medial meniscus, followed by layered closure of the incision. Postoperatively, serum samples were collected from the mice at 4 weeks (4w, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;12), 8 weeks (8w, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;12), and 12 weeks (12w, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;12), after which the mice were euthanized and the right hind limbs were harvested.</p><p id="Par11">Additionally, a batch of male 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;60) was purchased and raised until they reached 3 months (3&#160;m, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;9), 12 months (12&#160;m, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;9), and 18 months of age, at which point serum samples were collected.

After fixation in 1% acetic acid for 10&#160;s, the slides were washed with double-distilled water (ddH<sub>2</sub>O) two to three times to remove excess Fast Green. The sections were then stained with Safranin O for 3&#160;min, followed by dehydration and clearing.

OARSI scoring was used to evaluate the degree of cartilage damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), the sum of the OARSI scores from the four joint surfaces was calculated to represent the overall joint damage, with the maximum OARSI score among the four joint surfaces indicating the most severe damage. For age-dependent osteoarthritis (ADOA), the sum of the OARSI scores from the eight joint surfaces from both legs was calculated to represent the overall joint damage, with the maximum OARSI score among the eight joint surfaces indicating the most severe joint damage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p id="Par16">Prior to staining, slides were baked for 2&#160;h and dewaxed. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating the tissue sections with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2)</sub> at room temperature for 10&#160;min. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating the tissue sections with antigen retrieval enzyme in a humidified chamber at 37&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;min, followed by three washes with PBS. Tissue sections were then incubated with goat serum at 37&#160;&#176;C for 10&#160;min to block nonspecific binding. Rabbit anti-TSP-1 antibodies (1:50 dilution; ab267388, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were applied to the tissue sections in a humidified chamber at 37&#160;&#176;C for 2&#160;h. After washing, the amplification reagent was added, and the sections were incubated at 37&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;min to enhance signal intensity. Subsequently, tissue sections were incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at 37&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;min. The DAB chromogenic substrate was applied to the tissue sections, and color development was monitored under a microscope until the desired staining intensity was achieved. The reaction was stopped by immersing the slides in tap water once sufficient color developed.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par56">Recent studies have demonstrated the crucial role of TSP-1 in the pathogenesis of OA. Our previous studies have revealed that TSP-1 delays OA progression in rats by upregulating HSP27 to enhance chondrocyte autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this study, we observed reduced TSP-1 expression in joint cartilage and decreased TSP-1 concentrations in the synovial fluid and serum following ACLT in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This study systematically investigated the correlation between the changes in serum TSP-1 levels and OA severity.</p><p id="Par57">Initially, we induced DMM in mice, which exhibited evident OA degeneration at 8 weeks postoperatively. This finding contrasts with previous reports suggesting noticeable joint degeneration as early as 4 weeks post-DMM, possibly due to differences in surgical techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Additionally, we observed a significant decrease in serum TSP-1 concentration at 4 weeks after surgery, preceding the onset of OA degeneration, suggesting that changes in serum TSP-1 concentration preceded histological changes in the joint cartilage in PTOA. Given that clinical patients with OA predominantly suffer from ADOA, which is characterized by a pathogenesis and etiology distinct from that of PTOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], we developed an aged mouse model to examine TSP-1 alterations. Mice at 18 months of age exhibited clear OA degeneration, accompanied by a notable decrease in serum TSP-1 concentration, suggesting a higher sensitivity of serum TSP-1 concentration to ADOA changes.</p><p id="Par58">The OARSI scoring system remains a reliable method for evaluating the severity of cartilage damage in mouse joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We assessed the severity of OA on various joint surfaces, including the medial tibial plateau, medial femoral condyle, lateral tibial plateau, and lateral femoral condyle. Our results demonstrated significantly greater cartilage damage on the medial side than on the lateral side, confirming the success of the DMM model. Because the OARSI score of a single joint surface does not reflect the overall joint damage, we aggregated the OARSI scores of the four joint surfaces to represent the total joint damage, while also considering the maximum OARSI score among these surfaces as the peak damage level. Since aged mice develop age-related OA in the left, right, or both knees, a single knee may not adequately reflect the overall cartilage damage in aged mice. Therefore, we sampled and conducted histological staining of both left and right knees of aged mice to comprehensively assess the extent of cartilage damage. Similarly, the OARSI scores of all eight joint surfaces of both legs were summed to represent the total damage across both joints, with the maximum score among the eight surfaces indicating the maximum damage level. While previous studies mainly focused on unilateral cartilage injury in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], our approach offers a more comprehensive evaluation of cartilage damage in the mouse knee joint.</p><p id="Par59">In this study, we observed a decrease in the TSP-1 concentration in the serum of mice with moderate-to-severe OA induced by DMM, consistent with our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additionally, TSP-1 concentration showed a negative correlation with both the sum of the OARSI scores and the maximum OARSI score. Similarly, in mice with moderate-to-severe aging-induced OA, we observed a decrease in serum TSP-1 concentration, which also correlated negatively with the sum of the OARSI scores and the maximum OARSI score, consistent with that observed in the PTOA condition. To eliminate the effect of age-related changes on serum TSP-1 concentrations, 18-month-old mice were divided into mild and severe injury groups based on OA severity. The results showed that the TSP-1 concentration in mildly injured 18-month-old mice was significantly different from that in 3-month-old and 12-month-old mice and was notably higher than that in severely injured 18-month-old mice. This suggests that changes in serum TSP-1 levels during ADOA are minimally affected by age.</p><p id="Par60">We collected and analyzed serum and synovial fluid samples from 104 human subjects. The results indicated a decreasing trend in TSP-1 concentration in both serum and synovial fluid with increasing OA severity. Further analysis revealed a negative correlation between the TSP-1 concentration and OA severity. Because serum samples from Grade 0 were taken from patients with meniscus injuries and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries&#8212;conditions that differ from those of healthy individuals&#8212;we additionally collected serum samples from 24 healthy individuals at the Health Check-up Center of Shanxi Medical University Second Hospital. The results showed that serum TSP-1 concentrations in healthy individuals were consistent with those in Grade 0 patients, with no significant differences. This suggests that meniscal or ACL injuries may not affect serum TSP-1 concentrations. However, although this supplemental comparison indicates that injury alone may not alter TSP-1, individuals in the Grade 0 group were not equivalent to a truly healthy, asymptomatic population free of joint pathology. This choice potentially obscures subtle preclinical changes in TSP-1 levels that may be specific to the initiation of OA pathology and distinct from post-traumatic inflammation or repair processes. Consequently, our study design may have reduced the sensitivity of detecting TSP-1 changes occurring prior to overt structural damage or symptoms, limiting our ability to firmly establish TSP-1 as a biomarker for the earliest preradiographic stages of OA. The inclusion of a cohort of healthy age- and sex-matched individuals without any history of knee injury or symptoms would undoubtedly strengthen the specificity of TSP-1 as a diagnostic biomarker for early OA.</p><p id="Par61">We also analyzed the correlation among TSP-1 concentration, BMI, and age. The results indicated no significant correlation between TSP-1 concentration and BMI. Interestingly, we observed a significant correlation between TSP-1 concentration and age, which contradicts the results of our ADOA mouse study. However, considering that age is correlated with OA severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and that TSP-1 concentrations are significantly associated with OA severity, we suspect that the correlation between TSP-1 concentration and age may be a false positive. To clarify the relationship between TSP-1 concentration and age, we plan to increase the sample size and further optimize the statistical methods in future investigations.</p><p id="Par62">To further explore the diagnostic value of TSP-1, ROC analysis demonstrated that serum TSP-1 exhibited good diagnostic performance in both mouse models of PTOA and ADOA, with diagnostic sensitivity increasing as OA severity worsened. We then extended our study to human samples and observed that the diagnostic capability of TSP-1 became more sensitive with increasing OA severity, suggesting that TSP-1 may have better diagnostic efficacy for severe OA. Although this study provides compelling evidence for the association between serum TSP-1 levels and OA severity, limitations in sample size necessitate cautious interpretation of the results. Although the sample sizes in our mouse model (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;9&#8211;12 per group) and human cohort (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;16&#8211;24 per Outerbridge grade) met the minimum requirements determined by G*Power analysis, they remained relatively limited for robust biomarker validation. This limitation may affect statistical robustness in three key ways: insufficient power for subgroup analyses (e.g., sex-stratified or age-matched comparisons), potentially masking important biological variations; ROC-derived AUC values may overestimate diagnostic accuracy in broader populations; and the substantial disparity in sample sizes between Grade 0 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;24) and Grade&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;1 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;80) may introduce bias into the ROC results. Predictive claims regarding TSP-1&#8217;s ability to detect preclinical OA require validation in larger longitudinal cohorts. Consequently, our conclusions regarding the predictive role of TSP-1 are preliminary. Although the consistent inverse relationship across species and models (PTOA, ADOA, and human OA) supports its biological relevance, future multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are essential to establish its clinical utility.</p><p id="Par63">Considering the widespread expression of TSP-1 in other tissues, such as the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], TSP-1 has been studied as a biomarker for the aforementioned pathological conditions. Specifically, serum TSP-1 levels are elevated in patients with heart failure, kidney disease, and interstitial lung disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], whereas plasma TSP-1 levels are increased in patients with liver failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Therefore, evaluating whether the changes in serum TSP-1 levels originate from the cartilage is crucial. Immunohistochemical staining in mice showed a reduction in TSP-1 expression in articular cartilage with increasing OA severity, consistent with human findings. This similarity supports a potential correlation between serum TSP-1 concentration alterations and TSP-1 levels in the articular cartilage. Additionally, we observed a significant positive correlation between serum and synovial fluid TSP-1 concentrations in humans, suggesting that changes in serum TSP-1 concentrations may originate from the synovial fluid.</p><p id="Par64">In the ADOA mouse model, histological analysis using HE staining of the liver, kidney, lung, and heart tissues revealed no pathological changes. This ruled out the possibility that diseases in these organs could influence the levels of TSP-1 in the OA model. This step was crucial to eliminate potential confounding factors that might otherwise affect TSP-1 levels. We subsequently generated Acan<sup>CreERT2</sup>TSP-1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice to achieve cartilage-specific deletion of TSP-1. Although TSP-1 deletion did not result in overt joint cartilage damage, serum TSP-1 levels were significantly reduced, suggesting that the decrease in cartilage TSP-1 levels contributes to a lowered serum TSP-1 concentration. Furthermore, we excluded individuals with cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, or pulmonary diseases. This exclusion criterion ensured that our results directly reflected the relationship between TSP-1 and OA without interference from these comorbidities. In summary, the decrease in serum TSP-1 levels during OA may be attributed to the reduction in TSP-1 levels in cartilage.</p><p id="Par65">Although our study established that serum TSP-1 is a sensitive biomarker of OA severity, its functional role in disease pathogenesis warrants further clarification. The observed reduction in TSP-1 levels may reflect either a driver of cartilage degradation or a secondary consequence of joint damage. Our findings provide preliminary mechanistic insights: (1) cartilage-specific TSP-1 knockout mice (Acan<sup>CreERT2</sup>TSP-1<sup>fl/fl</sup> + TM) showed significantly reduced serum TSP-1 levels without immediate cartilage degeneration, suggesting that TSP-1 depletion alone may not initiate OA but could exacerbate its progression; (2) our previous work demonstrated that TSP-1 promotes HSP27 expression, enhancing chondrocyte autophagy and directly protecting cartilage from degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These findings support a protective function rather than a passive association. However, temporal dissociation in PTOA mice, in which serum TSP-1 decreased 4 weeks prior to histological changes, implies that it may serve as an early mediator. Future studies should investigate whether localized TSP-1 supplementation can rescue cartilage phenotypes in OA models. TSP-1 remains a robust diagnostic biomarker; however, its translational potential as a therapeutic target requires causal validation through gain-of-function intervention.</p><p id="Par66">Although this study ensured that our results reflected the direct relationship between TSP-1 and OA by excluding patients with cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and pulmonary diseases, it is important to recognize that patients with OA often present with multiple comorbidities, such as cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases, in clinical settings. These comorbidities may influence TSP-1 expression and interfere with its relationship with OA and TSP-1 levels. Given that serum TSP-1 levels can be affected by various diseases, relying solely on TSP-1 as an OA biomarker may not be ideal. A more clinically relevant approach is to assess the diagnosis of OA using a combination of biomarkers and clinical parameters. In our study, incorporating serum TSP-1 level, synovial fluid TSP-1 level, age, and BMI significantly improved diagnostic performance, particularly for the detection of early-stage OA. This finding suggests that integrating multiple biomarkers and clinical factors can effectively enhance the accuracy of early diagnosis of OA. Future studies should explore the combined use of additional biomarkers, such as COMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], CTX-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], MMP-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and others, to jointly assess the diagnosis and prognosis of OA, which may offer greater clinical relevance.</p><p id="Par67">Although murine models (PTOA and ADOA) provide valuable mechanistic insights, their translational limitations require careful consideration. First, the temporal progression of OA differs among species. In our DMM model, significant reductions in TSP-1 expression and histological changes were observed within 4&#8211;12 weeks, reflecting an accelerated post-injury pathology. In contrast, human OA develops over several years or decades, with subtle molecular changes preceding prolonged periods of structural damage. This temporal compression in mice may lead to an overestimation of the diagnostic window for early TSP-1 decline in humans. Second, establishing equivalent disease staging is challenging. Although murine OARSI scores are validated and effectively capture acute cartilage degradation in controlled injuries or aging, they do not fully replicate the multifactorial nature of the human OA milieu, including chronic low-grade inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], subchondral bone remodeling heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and synovial involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], which may influence TSP-1 dynamics differently. Third, the molecular complexity was incompletely modeled. TSP-1 operates within the intricate networks involving angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and extracellular matrix regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Although murine systems are useful for isolating specific pathways (e.g., cartilage-specific knockout), they cannot fully mirror the polygenic, epigenetic, and environmental interactions of human OA. For instance, comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], which is common in human OA but absent in our models, may confound TSP-1 levels, limiting biomarker generalizability. To bridge these gaps, human cohort analyses remain essential. In our study, we observed parallel reductions in TSP-1 levels in serum and synovial fluid across increasing Outerbridge grades, supporting conserved biology. However, the lower AUC for early OA diagnosis in humans highlights the challenges of translating murine sensitivity for early clinical detection. Future studies should prioritize longitudinal human cohorts to define TSP-1 kinetics across presymptomatic and end-stage OA, ideally integrating multiomics approaches to capture systemic complexity. Despite these limitations, our combined approach (serum TSP-1&#8201;+&#8201;synovial fluid TSP-1&#8201;+&#8201;age&#8201;+&#8201;BMI; AUC&#8201;=&#8201;0.870) demonstrated improved diagnostic performance compared to single-marker strategies, partially mitigating model-derived uncertainties.</p><p id="Par68">These findings strongly suggest that serum TSP-1 concentration may serve as an effective biomarker for assessing OA severity. While this biomarker was primarily studied in mice and a small human cohort in this research, the results presented here support its potential as a clinical biomarker for reducing OA-related &#8220;disease burden&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">Although this study provides preliminary evidence supporting the use of TSP-1 as a diagnostic biomarker for OA, some limitations must be acknowledged beyond the previously discussed sample size and definition of healthy controls. First, epidemiological data suggest that OA is more prevalent and severe in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], which was reflected in our cohort (only 12.5% of Grade IV patients were male) and may be associated with the chondroprotective effects of estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This imbalance, particularly the limited number of male patients with Grade IV disease, restricted our ability to perform robust sex-stratified analyses. While our findings demonstrated a negative correlation between serum TSP-1 levels and OA severity, we cannot exclude the possibility that TSP-1 expression and its diagnostic utility differ by sex. Estrogen has been shown to regulate TSP-1 expression in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and may directly influence cartilage-derived TSP-1. Our mouse models exclusively used male mice to avoid cyclic estrogenic effects, which further limits the generalizability of our findings to female populations. Future studies should validate TSP-1 dynamics in female OA models and conduct sex-stratified human analyses to determine whether diagnostic thresholds require sex-specific calibration, as biomarker performance may differ based on sex-specific pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Second, a significant age gap was noted between the Grade 0 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;24) and Grade IV (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;16) patients, which likely contributed to the relatively high AUC observed for age. To mitigate this bias, future studies should include more older Grade 0 patients. Third, although AcanCreERT2TSP-1&#160;fl/fl mice provide an in-depth model for studying the specific deletion of TSP-1 in the cartilage, this knockout strategy may also affect other tissues containing aggrecan, such as joint ligaments, intervertebral discs, and tendons. Therefore, our results may not fully represent the role of TSP-1 in OA, particularly in the regions outside the cartilage.</p><p id="Par70">Based on our results, TSP-1 emerged as a potential novel biomarker for diagnosing OA and reflecting its progression. Future research should focus on expanding the sample size to validate the diagnostic efficacy of the TSP-1. Additionally, further studies will explore the potential of TSP-1 as a clinical biomarker for &#8220;intervention effects&#8221; related to OA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
