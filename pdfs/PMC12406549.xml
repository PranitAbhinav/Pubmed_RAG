As adropin is a key regulator of cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis, this study investigated its therapeutic effects against HFpEF pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (60% fat-derived calories) with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 0.5&#160;g/L) in drinking water for 8 weeks to induce HFpEF. Adropin-knockout (Ad&#8315;/&#8315;) mice were generated, and HFpEF mice received a single intraperitoneal bolus of recombinant adropin (450 nmol kg&#8315;&#185;). Cardiac structure and function were quantified by echocardiography. Metabolic status was documented (body weight, fasting glucose, lipids, and systolic/diastolic blood pressure). Myocardial morphology, fibrosis and cardiomyocyte size were examined by hematoxylin&#8210;eosin, Masson&#8217;s trichrome and wheat&#8210;germ agglutinin staining. Oxidative stress was evaluated with dihydroethidium fluorescence (ROS) and biochemical assays for malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). The protein expression of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO-1 and apoptosis markers (Bcl-2/Bax) was determined by immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">HFpEF mice developed significant metabolic disturbances, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and increased oxidative stress, alongside markedly reduced serum and myocardial adropin levels. Adropin supplementation improved glucose and lipid metabolism, reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and enhanced diastolic function, whereas adropin knockout exacerbated these pathologies. Mechanistically, adropin activated the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, increased the expression of antioxidant enzymes (HO-1 and NQO-1), reduced the expression of oxidative stress markers, and regulated apoptosis by increasing Bcl-2 and decreasing Bax expression. HFpEF mice exhibited significant metabolic disturbances, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and elevated oxidative stress, alongside markedly reduced serum and myocardial adropin levels. Adropin treatment improved glucose/lipid metabolism, attenuated hypertrophy/fibrosis, and enhanced diastolic function, whereas adropin knockout exacerbated these pathologies. Mechanistically, adropin activated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, upregulated antioxidant enzymes (HO-1, NQO-1), reduced oxidative stress markers, and mitigated apoptosis by increasing Bcl-2/Bax ratio.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Adropin improves HFpEF by attenuating metabolic dysregulation, oxidative stress, and myocardial remodeling. Mechanistically, adropin activates the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for HFpEF. These findings highlight the potential of adropin to reduce disease burden and improve quality of life in HFpEF patients, addressing critical gaps in current HFpEF management.</p></sec><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par5">

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents a distinct subtype of HF characterized by a normal or mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) accompanied by impaired diastolic function. This dysfunction leads to elevated intracardiac pressures and circulatory abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The incidence of HFpEF is steadily increasing, particularly among older adults and women. Its pathophysiology is multifactorial and involves alterations in cardiac structure and function, metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Among these contributing factors, oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of HFpEF. In patients with HFpEF, increased oxidative stress is closely associated with cardiomyocyte injury, myocardial fibrosis, and subsequent deterioration of cardiac performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Consequently, identifying effective strategies to attenuate oxidative stress and preserve cardiac function is critical for improving clinical outcomes in HFpEF patients.</p><p id="Par8">Adropin, a recently identified peptide hormone, has emerged as a potential cardioprotective factor because of its regulatory effects on energy metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although it was initially discovered in relation to metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], subsequent studies have revealed its broader physiological significance in cardiovascular health. Notably, circulating adropin levels are reduced in patients with HF and are inversely correlated with HF severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, adropin has been shown to ameliorate metabolic and inflammatory disturbances in cardiovascular conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A recent study involving 561 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients revealed that individuals with both diabetes and HFpEF exhibited a notable decline in serum adropin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, it remains unclear whether adropin supplementation or activation can confer therapeutic benefits in HFpEF patients. Therefore, further investigation is warranted to elucidate its potential as a treatment modality.</p><p id="Par9">Nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8211;related factor 2 (Nrf2), a central transcription factor, plays a pivotal role in modulating antioxidant defense systems by upregulating enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. HO-1 exerts antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects by degrading heme into bioactive molecules with cytoprotective properties, thereby reducing oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway has demonstrated promising therapeutic potential in cardiovascular diseases by enhancing the antioxidant defense of cardiomyocytes and mitigating oxidative stress-induced myocardial injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recent studies suggest that adropin may activate the Nrf2/HO-1 axis, thereby increasing the intracellular antioxidant capacity and protecting tissues from oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Building upon established knowledge of the metabolic regulatory functions of adropin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], this study addresses a critical knowledge gap by investigating its unexplored therapeutic potential in HFpEF. The central hypothesis of this study posits that adropin exerts cardioprotective effects against HFpEF through multimodal mechanisms. The present work provides three fundamental advances in the field: first, causal evidence was established through genetic and pharmacological approaches demonstrating that adropin deficiency exacerbates while supplementation ameliorates HFpEF progression; second, the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant pathway, as a novel mechanistic mediator of the cardioprotective effects of adropin, was identified; third, the unique capacity of adropin to simultaneously target multiple pathological axes in HFpEF, a distinct therapeutic advantage over current single-mechanism approaches, was revealed. These findings extend understanding of adropin&#8217;s cardiovascular benefits by defining its specific role and mechanisms in HFpEF pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par11">All animal procedures used male C57BL/6 mice aged 4&#8211;6 weeks (Hunan SJA Laboratory Animal Co., China), which were maintained at 22&#8211;25&#160;&#176;C under a 12-h light/dark cycle.

Adropin treatment reversed these changes, decreasing ROS/MDA and restoring GSH/SOD levels, demonstrating its crucial role in suppressing myocardial oxidative damage in HFpEF.</p><p id="Par54">Nrf2 is a master regulator of cellular antioxidant responses, primarily through transcriptional activation of antioxidant response element (ARE)-regulated genes, including HO-1 and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated that activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway confers cardioprotective effects by reducing apoptosis, limiting fibrosis, and improving cardiac function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For example, Nrf2 activation has been shown to inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis via the modulation of Bcl-2 and Bax expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These findings are in line with previous observations, indicating that the cardioprotective effects of adropin may be mediated, at least in part, through Nrf2/HO-1 activation.</p><p id="Par55">Emerging evidence indicates adropin exerts antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects via additional pathways, including VEGFR2-mediated ERK1/2 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], suggesting its protective effects involve a complex regulatory network. Mitochondrial dysfunction drives myocardial injury in conditions like sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and adropin has been shown to activate Nrf2/ARE signaling, reduce mitochondrial ROS, and enhance antioxidant defenses in septic cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It also suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TGF-&#946;1 and IL-6) to mitigate immune-mediated myocardial injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In radiation-induced injury, adropin promotes cardiac recovery via VEGFR2/PI3K/Akt activation, enhancing angiogenesis and reducing apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], while also improving eNOS activity, microvascular perfusion, and infarct size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These diverse mechanisms highlight adropin&#8217;s therapeutic potential across cardiovascular pathologies involving oxidative and metabolic dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Study strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par56">This study has key strengths advancing the understanding of adropin&#8217;s therapeutic potential in HFpEF. First, combining genetic knockout and pharmacological supplementation rigorously established adropin&#8217;s causal role in HFpEF pathophysiology. Multimodal assessment (echocardiography, histopathology, molecular analyses) strengthened the findings. Importantly, Nrf2/HO-1 pathway was identified as a novel mechanistic link between adropin and oxidative stress mitigation, revealing new therapeutic targets. Adropin&#8217;s simultaneous improvement of metabolic parameters and cardiac function underscores its clinical relevance, addressing a critical unmet need. Limitations include the use of a murine model, which may not fully replicate human HFpEF complexity, and the relatively short (8-week) intervention period, limiting insights into chronic progression. While focused on Nrf2/HO-1, other signaling mechanisms likely contribute to adropin&#8217;s effects and warrant investigation. Future studies exploring adropin in larger models and human samples, along with optimal dosing/delivery, will enhance translational potential. These limitations highlight research directions without diminishing the current findings&#8217; significance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par57">Adropin plays a crucial protective role in HFpEF by improving metabolic dysregulation, attenuating myocardial remodeling, and reducing oxidative stress via activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. These findings position adropin as both a promising therapeutic target and biomarker for HFpEF, particularly in patients with metabolic comorbidities. Future research should translate these findings by evaluating adropin-based therapies in human trials and exploring their synergy with existing HFpEF treatments. This work provides a strong foundation for developing targeted interventions to improve outcomes in HFpEF patients, addressing a critical unmet need.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
