Alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis is a key pathological hallmark of PF, but the upstream regulators driving this process remain unclear. Caspase-9, a central initiator of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, has been implicated in fibrotic diseases across multiple organs. However, its role in lung fibrosis and its molecular interactions are not fully elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Caspase-9 expression was analyzed in human PF lung tissues, bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse models, and TGF-&#946;1-treated MLE-12 alveolar epithelial cells. Functional studies included pharmacological inhibition, siRNA knockdown, and overexpression of Caspase-9. Fibrosis and apoptosis were assessed using Western blot, qPCR, immunohistochemistry, TUNEL, and electron microscopy. Interaction with &#946;-catenin was examined via co-localization, modulation, and rescue experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Caspase-9 and cleaved-Caspase-9 were significantly upregulated in fibrotic lungs and TGF-&#946;1-stimulated epithelial cells. Caspase-9 inhibition reduced collagen deposition, improved lung architecture, and suppressed pro-fibrotic markers in mice. In MLE-12 cells, Caspase-9 knockdown attenuated TGF-&#946;1-induced apoptosis, restored E-cadherin, and downregulated fibrotic genes. Conversely, Caspase-9 overexpression aggravated fibrosis and apoptosis. Mechanistically, Caspase-9 interacted with &#946;-catenin, enhanced its nuclear accumulation, and promoted downstream fibrotic signaling. &#946;-catenin silencing reversed Caspase-9-induced fibrosis, while &#946;-catenin activation nullified the protective effects of Caspase-9 inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. These results identify a functional Caspase-9/&#946;-catenin axis in PF progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Caspase-9 drives pulmonary fibrosis by promoting epithelial apoptosis and activating &#946;-catenin signaling.

Despite advances in our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, the clinical management of PF remains a major challenge. Current pharmacological interventions, including antifibrotic agents such as pirfenidone and nintedanib, can slow disease progression to some extent but are unable to reverse established fibrosis or significantly improve long-term outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore novel molecular targets and develop more effective therapeutic strategies to halt or even reverse the fibrotic process.</p><p id="Par6">Among the diverse pathological mechanisms implicated in PF, apoptosis has emerged as a central feature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays a critical role in maintaining tissue homeostasis. However, in the context of PF, excessive or dysregulated apoptosis-particularly of alveolar epithelial cells-disrupts the epithelial barrier, facilitates fibroblast activation, and promotes chronic fibrogenic signaling, ultimately leading to aberrant tissue remodeling and scarring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Understanding the upstream regulators of apoptosis in fibrotic lungs is therefore essential to decipher the initiation and progression of this disease. Caspases, a family of cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases, are the principal executors of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Among them, caspase-9 functions as a key initiator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway. Upon mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c is released into the cytosol and binds to Apaf-1, leading to the formation of the apoptosome and subsequent activation of caspase-9. This activation triggers a cascade of downstream effector caspases (such as caspase-3 and &#8722;&#8201;7), culminating in controlled cellular disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Given the critical contribution of epithelial apoptosis to PF, elucidating the role of caspase-9 in lung fibrogenesis is of particular relevance.</p><p id="Par7">Recent studies have begun to uncover a potential link between caspase-9 and fibrotic diseases across various organ systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Increased expression and activation of caspase-9 have been observed in experimental models of renal, hepatic, and cardiac fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For instance, in murine models of kidney disease, caspase-9 activation contributes to tubular epithelial apoptosis and drives interstitial matrix accumulation, exacerbating renal fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Similarly, in models of liver fibrosis, caspase-9-dependent hepatocyte apoptosis has been shown to activate hepatic stellate cells and promote collagen deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These observations suggest that caspase-9 may not merely be a passive bystander during tissue injury, but rather a key pathological mediator driving fibrotic remodeling, potentially through both apoptosis-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Given the conserved role of caspase-9 in fibrogenesis across organs, it is plausible that this pathway may also contribute significantly to pulmonary fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms linking caspase-9 activity to pro-fibrotic signaling in the lung remain incompletely understood.</p><p id="Par8">In this study, we sought to investigate the functional role of caspase-9 in pulmonary fibrosis and delineate the downstream mechanisms involved. Using both bleomycin-induced mouse models and TGF-&#946;-stimulated alveolar epithelial cells, we examined the expression, activity, and pathological significance of caspase-9. Furthermore, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of pharmacological caspase-9 inhibition and explored its impact on &#946;-catenin-mediated pro-fibrotic signaling. Our findings identify caspase-9 as a key upstream regulator of pulmonary fibrosis and provide a rationale for targeting the caspase-9/&#946;-catenin axis as a novel strategy to mitigate fibrotic lung disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Clinical specimens</title><p id="Par9">Lung tissue samples were collected from 20 patients (10 non-fibrotic controls and 10 pulmonary fibrosis cases) at the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University.

The goal was to determine whether Caspase-9 upregulation could exacerbate the fibrotic response, particularly under TGF-&#946;1 stimulation. Western blotting and qPCR confirmed efficient overexpression of Caspase-9 at both protein and mRNA levels (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A&#8211;C), establishing a robust Caspase-9-overexpressing model. Through Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, we further found that Caspase-9 overexpression leads to a significant increase in both total and activated Caspase-9 levels, irrespective of TGF-&#946; treatment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D&#8211;G). When stimulated with TGF-&#946;1, MLE-12 cells showed heightened expression of fibrotic markers including fibronectin (FN), collagen I (Col I), collagen III (Col III) and vimentin, reflecting a fibrotic phenotype. Notably, Caspase-9 overexpression exacerbated these changes, as evidenced by elevated protein levels in Western blot analyses (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D&#8211;E). Additionally, our results revealed that TGF-&#946; stimulation suppresses E-cadherin (E-cad) expression, and this suppressive effect is further strengthened by Caspase-9 overexpression, ultimately resulting in increased ECM deposition (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D&#8211;E). Collectively, these findings further support that Caspase-9 promotes pulmonary fibrosis. We next explored whether Caspase-9 overexpression could enhance apoptosis. TGF-&#946;1 treatment led to a marked increase in cleaved caspase-3 expression, a key mediator of apoptosis. This effect was significantly intensified by Caspase-9 overexpression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A&#8211;C), suggesting that Caspase-9 promotes apoptotic signaling in pulmonary epithelial cells. Furthermore, our Western blot analysis revealed a significant downregulation of Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio in OE-NC&#8201;+&#8201;TGF-&#946;1 group, and Caspase-9 overexpression further promoted this downregulation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D&#8211;E).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provided additional evidence, revealing classic apoptotic features such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation in cells overexpressing Caspase-9 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>H).

Western blot analysis revealed a significant downregulation of Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio in BLM-treated mice groups compared with Control group, and Caspase-9 inhibition alleviated this downregulation significantly (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>D&#8211;E). TUNEL staining (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>G&#8211;F) further showed a substantial decrease in apoptotic cells in the inhibitor group. Ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>H) confirmed reduced apoptotic features, including chromatin condensation and apoptotic body formation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Caspase-9 inhibition mitigates BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis and epithelial apoptosis in mice, supporting its potential as a therapeutic target.</p><p id="Par31">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>The Caspase-9/cleaved-Caspase-9 and &#946;-catenin interaction mediates pulmonary fibrosis</title><p id="Par33">To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying Caspase-9-induced fibrosis, we examined protein interactions and found a direct association between Caspase-9/cleaved-Caspase-9 and &#946;-catenin in human and mouse fibrotic lung tissues (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>A&#8211;D). This interaction suggests a functional partnership in the fibrotic process. Consistent with this, &#946;-catenin expression was significantly elevated in both human and mouse fibrotic tissues, as well as in TGF-&#946;1-treated MLE-12 cells, highlighting its conserved role in pulmonary fibrosis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>E&#8211;J). We further explored the relationship between Caspase-9 and &#946;-catenin through rescue experiments. Overexpression of Caspase-9 in TGF-&#946;1-treated MLE-12 cells led to increased fibrosis markers (FN, collagen I, collagen III, &#945;-SMA). However, silencing &#946;-catenin with siRNA abrogated this fibrotic response. Conversely, activating &#946;-catenin in Caspase-9-inhibited cells restored the fibrotic phenotype, suggesting that Caspase-9 acts upstream of &#946;-catenin in the fibrotic pathway (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>K&#8211;L). Immunofluorescence staining (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>M&#8211;N) confirmed the colocalization of Caspase-9 and &#946;-catenin in alveolar epithelial cells, supporting the functional data. These findings establish a novel mechanism where the interaction between Caspase-9 and &#946;-catenin amplifies fibrogenic signaling in pulmonary epithelial cells. Targeting this axis may provide a therapeutic strategy for fibrotic lung diseases.</p><p id="Par34">

</p><p id="Par35">Then, we have performed rescue experiments in our murine model to assess the impact on physiological parameters of lung fibrosis. Western blot and Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that fibrosis markers significantly increased in BLM-treated mice, including Fibronectin, collagen I, collagen III and &#945;-SMA, while intraperitoneal injection of caspase 9 inhibitor markedly reduced these markers (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>A&#8211;C). Consistent with molecular findings, HE and Masson staining showed similar results (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>C). BLM-treated mice had severe alveolar destruction and collagen deposition. Caspase 9 inhibitor alleviated structural abnormalities, reduced collagen, confirming its anti-fibrotic effect. Importantly, to validate the role of &#946;-catenin in this process, we then conducted additional experiments where &#946;-catenin was activated concurrently with caspase-9 inhibition. Under these conditions, the fibrotic markers and pathological scores were re-elevated, indicating that the protective effect of caspase-9 inhibition was abrogated by &#946;-catenin activation.

Despite the availability of antifibrotic drugs such as pirfenidone and nintedanib, these treatments primarily slow the progression of the disease without reversing established fibrosis or improving long-term outcomes significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms driving PF is essential for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. This study focuses on exploring the role of Caspase-9 in pulmonary fibrosis, specifically its interaction with &#946;-catenin, a key player in the Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway. Our results provide significant insights into the contribution of Caspase-9 to fibrotic processes in the lung, highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic target.</p><p id="Par38">Caspase-9 is a central initiator of apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Upon activation, it leads to the cleavage of effector caspases, such as Caspase-3, initiating a cascade that results in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In the context of PF, dysregulated apoptosis, especially of alveolar epithelial cells, plays a critical role in the disruption of lung architecture and promotes fibroblast activation, a hallmark of fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that Caspase-9 is upregulated in fibrotic tissues across various organs, including the liver, kidney, and heart, where it contributes to both apoptotic and non-apoptotic fibrotic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Our findings align with this body of work, as we observed increased expression of Caspase-9 and its active form in both human and mouse fibrotic lung tissues. These results suggest that Caspase-9 not only plays a role in cell death but also contributes to the pro-fibrotic microenvironment.</p><p id="Par39">Moreover, in vitro studies using the TGF-&#946;1-treated MLE-12 cell model revealed that Caspase-9 inhibition attenuates both fibrosis and apoptosis, indicating that Caspase-9 is a key mediator of both processes in alveolar epithelial cells. This observation is consistent with previous research suggesting that caspases may drive fibrogenesis through both apoptotic and non-apoptotic mechanisms, with Caspase-9 being a critical player [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, Caspase-9 overexpression amplified fibrotic markers and apoptosis, further emphasizing its role in promoting fibrotic progression. These findings provide compelling evidence for the involvement of Caspase-9 in driving both fibrosis and cell death in the lung, which could contribute to the pathogenesis of PF.</p><p id="Par40">A significant part of our study was dedicated to understanding the molecular mechanisms by which Caspase-9 promotes pulmonary fibrosis. We discovered a direct interaction between Caspase-9 and &#946;-catenin, a key mediator of the Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This interaction was observed both in human and mouse fibrotic tissues, and its functional significance was confirmed through various experimental approaches. Silencing &#946;-catenin reversed the pro-fibrotic effects of Caspase-9 overexpression, while pharmacological activation of &#946;-catenin in Caspase-9-inhibited cells restored fibrosis markers. These findings suggest that Caspase-9 acts upstream of &#946;-catenin to amplify fibrogenic signaling in pulmonary epithelial cells, highlighting the Caspase-9/&#946;-catenin axis as a critical pathway in pulmonary fibrosis.</p><p id="Par41">The Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway is known to regulate a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In the context of fibrosis, aberrant activation of &#946;-catenin has been implicated in the regulation of fibrosis-related gene expression and ECM deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated the role of &#946;-catenin in promoting fibrosis in various organs, including the liver and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For instance, &#946;-catenin activation in hepatic stellate cells contributes to liver fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and &#946;-catenin signaling has been shown to enhance renal fibrosis in response to injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Our findings suggest that Caspase-9-induced &#946;-catenin activation is a key mechanism in promoting pulmonary fibrosis, providing a new perspective on how cell death and signaling pathways converge to drive fibrosis in the lung.</p><p id="Par42">Our results are in line with previous studies exploring the role of Caspase-9 in fibrotic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] yet they extend the current understanding by identifying a novel Caspase-9/&#946;-catenin interaction in pulmonary fibrosis. For example, previous work has established that TGF-&#946;1 is a potent inducer of fibrosis, and its role in activating apoptotic and fibrotic pathways has been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, the specific contribution of Caspase-9 in this context was less clear. Our study provides direct evidence that Caspase-9 is not only involved in apoptosis but also plays a central role in driving fibrosis through the &#946;-catenin signaling pathway. Additionally, while the role of &#946;-catenin in fibrosis has been well established, our study highlights a new dimension by showing that Caspase-9 can directly regulate &#946;-catenin activation. This finding offers a novel therapeutic target, as inhibiting the Caspase-9/&#946;-catenin axis may provide a dual approach to reduce both cell death and fibrosis in pulmonary diseases.</p><p id="Par43">In summary, our study identifies Caspase-9 as a key regulator of pulmonary fibrosis through its interaction with &#946;-catenin. We demonstrate that Caspase-9 activates &#946;-catenin signaling, which in turn amplifies fibrotic responses in alveolar epithelial cells. These findings provide a novel mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and open up new therapeutic avenues for targeting the Caspase-9/&#946;-catenin axis. Although challenges remain in translating these findings into clinical practice, our research lays the groundwork for future studies aimed at developing targeted therapies for fibrotic lung diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
