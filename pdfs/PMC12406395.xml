Nevertheless, the outlines of jellyfish can be recognized by the slight reflection of light from their body surfaces. In some jellyfish species, the epidermis covering the body surface has an array of microvilli, nanostructures that can potentially reduce light reflection. However, the anti-reflective effect is minimal in water, as the difference in the refractive indices of tissue and seawater is so small that reflectance is low, even on flat surfaces. In jellyfish that have pneumatophores, structures used in floating and drifting on the sea surface, light reflection on the surface is expected to be large and noticeable owing to the large differences in refractive indices between the pneumatophore exposed above the water surface and air. In the current study, we examined the epidermal ultrastructure and refractive index of the pneumatophores of a Portuguese man o&#8217; war (<italic toggle="yes">Physalia physalis</italic>) and a by-the-wind sailor (<italic toggle="yes">Velella velella</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">The refractive index of <italic toggle="yes">P. physalis</italic> pneumatophores measured with an Abbe refractometer was approximately 1.344. Microvillar arrays were found in epidermal cells of both <italic toggle="yes">P. physalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">V. velella</italic>. Based on the length, thickness, and pitch of the microvilli, we constructed simplified structural models for the simulation of light reflection using rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA). Our simulations showed that reflectance on the microvillar models could be greater or less than that on the flat surface, depending on light conditions (wavelength and angle of incidence), but with an overall effect of reduced reflection. Reflection reduction in microvillar models was particularly significant at large incident angles, where reflectance was extremely high on the flat surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Microvillar arrays found on the epidermis potentially reduce surface reflections of the pneumatophore and contribute to the reduction in visibility of the pleustonic hydrozoans above the sea surface. Moreover, less reflection at the pneumatophore surface indicates greater transmission of light through transparent bodies, potentially providing a counter-illumination effect that obscures the shadow of the hydrozoan bodies, depending on the intensity of ambient light.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40851-025-00253-4.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Anti-reflection</kwd><kwd>Microvillar array</kwd><kwd>Pleuston</kwd><kwd>Pneumatophore</kwd><kwd>Refractometry</kwd><kwd>Rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Nishikawa</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010790</institution-id><institution>Erasmus+</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Erasmus+</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Zoological Society of Japan 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Modern warships are sometimes painted in camouflage patterns, but what about the Portuguese man o&#8217; war as it drifts silently on the sea surface? <italic toggle="yes">Physalia physalis</italic> (Linnaeus, 1758) (Hydrozoa: Siphonophora: Phisaliidae) is a colonial hydrozoan that is widely known as a dangerous pleuston owing to its venomous nematocysts, which occasionally cause fatal accidents (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A).

</p><p id="Par6">In our ultrastructural survey of exumbrellar surfaces for nanostructures that suppress visibility in cnidarian medusae, we found that the exumbrellar epidermis of some species had arrays of microvilli, which may reduce surface light reflection; moreover, optical simulations showed that the microvillar array may reduce surface light reflection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although such microvillar arrays are slightly larger than the moth-eye structure (nipple array), which is widely known as the non-reflective structure in insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the results of our optical simulations suggested that microvilli reduce light reflection on the cnidarian exumbrellar surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], similar to the effect of nanoscale nipple arrays on the tunic surface in some tunicates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, surface reflections are relatively small in jellyfish, even without surface nanostructures, because the difference in the refractive index between jellyfish tissue and seawater is very small. Therefore, the anti-reflective effect of the microvillar array in water is much smaller than that of the moth-eye structure of insects in air. The greater the difference in the refractive index between a surface tissue and its environment, the greater the light reflectance. Thus, insects living in an aerobic regime with a low refractive index (ca. 1) have a greater reflectance at their body surface, whereas jellyfish in an aquatic environment with a high refractive index (&gt;&#8201;1.33) exhibit a smaller reflectance. This raised the question, would jellyfish possessing tissue exposed to air exhibit anti-glare structures?</p><p id="Par7">The pneumatophores of <italic toggle="yes">P. physalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">V. velella</italic> are mostly exposed to air.

Because the refractive index of the <italic toggle="yes">P. physalis</italic> pneumatophore was approximately 1.344 in our refractometric measurements, in this simulation we assumed the difference between the refractive indices of air and the pneumatophore surface to be 0.344 in the simulation.

The light reflectance of TM waves was approximately 2% at an angle of incidence of 0&#176;, as found for the TE wave, and the reflectance of the TM wave was minimum (&lt;&#8201;0.0002%) at 53.3&#176;, due to Brewster&#8217;s angle, and rapidly increased with the increase in incident angle (top right in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>); the reflectance was 25% at 80.3&#176;, 50% at 85.1&#176;, and &gt;&#8201;90% at 89.3&#176;. The reflectance was &lt;&#8201;0.001% within the orange area in the heat map for the TM wave on the flat surface (white arrows in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par23">In the nanostructure model of <italic toggle="yes">P. physalis</italic>, the light reflectance of TE waves tended to increase with increasing incident angle as found on the flat surface, but the change varied with wavelength (middle-left in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In addition, conditions where the reflectance was lower (or higher) than that of the surrounding area were observed on the heat map in the form of curves (black arrows in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). For instance, the reflectance of 600-nm light was 0.055% at 0&#186;, 25% at 83.2&#176;, 50% at 87&#186;, and &gt; 90% at 89.6&#176;, while the minimum reflectance was 0.016% at 10&#186;.

Similar curves were also observed in the heat map for the TM waves (middle right in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The reflectance of the TM waves decreased around Brewster&#8217;s angle, as found on the flat surface, but the decrease was remarkably less. The minimum reflectance of the TM wave was 0.91% at 51&#176; for 400&#160;nm light, 0.28% at 53&#8211;53.6&#176; for 600&#160;nm light, and 0.91% at 51&#176; for 800&#160;nm light. The light reflection of the nanostructure model based on <italic toggle="yes">V. velella</italic> (bottom in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) was roughly similar to that of the <italic toggle="yes">Physalia</italic> model.

Overall, the reflectance of the nanostructures was lower than on the flat surfaces in the TE wave, occupying approximately 92% (<italic toggle="yes">Physalia</italic> model) and 94% (<italic toggle="yes">Velella</italic> model) of the area on the heat map, respectively. Even in the range of incidence angles above 80&#186;, where the reflectance is approximately 50% or higher on the flat surface, the reflectance is lower than that at the flat surface in areas of approximately 97% of the <italic toggle="yes">Physalia</italic> model and 89% of the <italic toggle="yes">Velella</italic> model surfaces, respectively. Notably, for light of wavelength 600&#8211;800&#160;nm, the reflectance of the <italic toggle="yes">Physalia</italic> model was more than 10 percentage points lower than that of flat surfaces in the range of approximately 80&#186; to 88&#186;. Moreover, in the range of incident angles greater than 80&#186;, 22.3% of the areas had reflectance more than 30 points lower, and 5.6% had reflectance more than 40 points lower in this heat map (upper left in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The reflectance of TM waves on the nanostructures was smaller than that on the flat surface in the areas of approximately 57% (<italic toggle="yes">Physalia</italic> model) and 62% (<italic toggle="yes">Velella</italic> model), respectively, in the heat maps (left column in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). As described above, the reflectivity of TM waves around Brewster&#8217;s angle is significantly smaller on flat surfaces; however, this decrease in reflectivity is much less prominent on nanostructured surfaces (right column in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Therefore, the reflectivity of the nanostructure is greater than that of the flat surface in the range of incidence angles from approximately 30&#186; to 70&#186;, including Brewster&#8217;s angle (right column in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par26">In the two pleustonic hydrozoans <italic toggle="yes">P. physalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">V. velella</italic>, arrays of microvilli regularly emerged from the apical membrane of the epidermis. Similar microvillar arrays have been reported from the exumbrellar epidermis of cubozoan jellyfish, such as <italic toggle="yes">Chironex yamaguchii</italic> Lewis and Bentlage, 2009, and optical simulation using RCWA suggested that these nanostructures potentially reduced light reflectance at the exumbrellar surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Interestingly, the dimensions of the microvilli of <italic toggle="yes">C. yamaguchii</italic> (approximately 500&#160;nm in height and 365&#160;nm in pitch) are not significantly different from those of <italic toggle="yes">P. physalis</italic> (approximately 420&#160;nm in height and 450&#160;nm in pitch). The scyphozoan jellyfish, <italic toggle="yes">Mastigias papua</italic>, also has dense microvilli on its exumbrellar epidermis, but their height exceeds 2&#160;&#956;m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the optical properties imparted by surface nanostructures have very different functional significance for exumbrellas in seawater and pneumatophores exposed to air. Because the difference in refractive index between umbrella tissue and seawater is very small (&#8776;&#8201;0.001), the surface reflectance of unstructured surfaces is also quite small; thus, any nanostructural effect in reducing reflectance is presumed to be limited. However, the difference in refractive index between air (ca. 1) and pneumatophore (ca. 1.344) is much greater than that between seawater (ca. 1.343) and tissue, resulting in greater reflectance of the pneumatophore in the air, and thus the effect of the nanostructure in reflectance reduction is expected to be much more pronounced in the air. A loose mucus-like structure was present on the surface of the epidermis, where the microvilli were arrayed (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B&#8211;D). This mucus layer may serve as an optical layer on the surface, and the measured refractive indices reflect the optical properties of the mucus layer. The mucus layer is also important for protecting the epidermis from drying out from exposure to air, and the microvillar array may effectively retain mucus on the surface.</p><p id="Par27">In the present study, we performed simulations of light reflection using RCWA and compared the reflectance on a flat surface and simplified nanostructure models based on the ultrastructure of <italic toggle="yes">P. physalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">V. velella</italic>. In the heat maps of reflectance on the nanostructure models, reflectance was lower (or higher) than the surrounding area under different conditions (wavelength&#8211;incident angle), which when plotted took the form of curves in the heat maps (black arrows in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The conditions that make up these curves may be due to diffracted light, as the nanostructures in the models were spaced at strictly equal intervals. Because the pitch of the microvillar arrays of jellyfish tissue is not strictly uniform (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplemental Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), the diffraction effect is not expected to be as pronounced in actual animal tissue.</p><p id="Par28">In the heat maps showing the differences in reflectance between the nanostructured models and flat surfaces (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), the reflectance of the nanostructured models was mostly smaller than that of the flat surface. In particular, the reflectance of the TE wave on the <italic toggle="yes">Physalia</italic> model was markedly reduced in the range of large incident angles (e.g., &gt;80&#186;), at which the reflectance on the flat surface was 50% or more, and the flat surface had a TE wave reflectance up to 43.3 percentage points greater than that of the <italic toggle="yes">Physalia</italic> model (upper left in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The considerable reduction in reflectivity due to the nanostructures suggests that the microvillar array of the pneumatophores makes the pleustonic hydrozoa less visible from the air. The reflectance was larger in the nanostructured models, depending on the wavelength and incident angle. A major case is the reflectance of the TM wave around Brewster&#8217;s angle of incidence (right column in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The reflectance was extremely small (&lt;&#8201;0.0002%) at Brewster&#8217;s angle on a flat surface; however, the decrease in reflectance around Brewster&#8217;s angle was not prominent in the nanostructured models. Under the conditions where the reflectance of the TM wave on the nanostructured models was higher than that of the flat surface, the maximum difference in reflectance was only 7.1 percentage points for the <italic toggle="yes">Physalia</italic> model and 3.2 percentage points for the <italic toggle="yes">Velella</italic> model. Accordingly, the effects of the reflectance increase due to the nanostructures are considered to be very small compared to those of the reflectance decrease due to the nanostructures at larger incident angles, at which the reflectance of the flat surface was greater.</p><p id="Par29">What are the benefits to hydrozoans in reducing light reflection on their float surfaces? Some seabirds are known to prey on pleustonic jellyfish, including <italic toggle="yes">Physalia</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Velella</italic>, which have strongly venomous cnidocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Because seabirds are visual predators, less reflective floats are expected to be less visible to those predators above the water surface. However, it is uncertain how serious the predation pressure by seabirds is on pleustonic hydrozoans. It is likely that the major predators of <italic toggle="yes">Physalia</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Velella</italic> are submerged or floating marine animals such as sea turtles, fish, heterobranchs, and cephalopods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Reduced light reflection on the pneumatophore indicates greater transmission of light through transparent bodies, potentially providing a counter-illumination effect that obscures the shadow of the jellyfish during the daytime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Additionally, as <italic toggle="yes">Physalia</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Velella</italic> are carnivores that capture prey with their tentacles with venomous cnidocytes, being less visible underwater may confer a significant advantage in their ambush hunting behaviors.</p><p id="Par30">Various invertebrates have a vision system that utilizes polarized light to improve object detection [e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which may be effective in visualizing transparent objects, such as jellyfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We compared polarization extinction ratios through the hydrozoan float into the water based on the reflectivity of the nanostructured and unstructured models (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). As the reflectance of the TM wave is extremely small around Brewster&#8217;s angle, the reflection of the TM wave is smaller than that of the TE wave at the water surface. Therefore, more TM waves are transmitted into the water column than are TE waves. According to the results of the present simulation, nanostructured models transmit more TE waves than flat models, while reflecting more TM waves around Brewster&#8217;s angle. Sunlight transmitted through pleustonic hydrozoans consists of more TE waves and fewer TM waves than does light transmitted through the water surface, which may have the effect of deceiving animals that use polarized light for vision.</p><p id="Par31">

For further discussion, ultrastructural comparisons of the exumbrella and pneumatophore epidermis are required across a wide range of jellyfish species. It has also been pointed out that nanoscale nipple arrays may not only reduce light reflection, but also impart various properties to the surface, such as modification of water wettability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], anti-contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], bubble repellency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], suppression of cellar function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and anti-biofouling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

The simulation of light reflection using RCWA indicated that nanostructures reduced reflectance, particularly in the range of higher incident angles. It is presumed that these hydrozoan floats are low-reflective objects above the sea surface and brighter objects when looked up from water. Therefore, the microvillar array may reduce the visibility of these transparent jellyfish bodies during the day. For the TM wave, the light reflection around Brewster&#8217;s angle is expected to be greater on the structured surface than on the flat surface. This may have a disguising effect on visual systems using polarized light. Microvillar arrays can serve a variety of functions, such as increasing the surface area of the epidermis and retaining mucus. These structures have been reported in several species of cnidarians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and may be independently developed in each taxon for their own functional needs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
