TBI patients are facing difficult diagnostic, management, and rehabilitative challenges. This review article represents the most relevant recent findings in all areas of TBI concerning pathophysiology, diagnostics, therapeutics, rehabilitation approaches and neuroplasticity. In recent years, the diagnosis of TBI has improved more often due to advancements in neuroimaging, biomarkers, and artificial intelligence. Pharmacological treatments, stem cell therapy, and neuroprotective strategies are also associated with a wide range of therapeutic innovations that could open new fields of acute management. Consequently, practice has also changed, and cross professional treatments have been adopted with the aid of the latest technology for acute TBI recovery. TBI management faces multiple challenges in special populations, such as pediatric patients, elderly people, and soldiers. Personalized medicine, big data analytics, and global collaboration are emphasized as future research directions. This detailed study should serve to remind researchers and clinicians alike of the ongoing need for innovation to deliver better care pathways appropriate for TBI patients.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40708-025-00271-0.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Biomarker</kwd><kwd>Cell- and tissue-based therapy</kwd><kwd>Neuroplasticity</kwd><kwd>Neuroprotection</kwd><kwd>Traumatic brain injury</kwd><kwd>TBI</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019345</institution-id><institution>King Salman Center for Disability Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KSRG-2024-307</award-id><award-id>KSRG-2024-307</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Bashir</surname><given-names>Shahid</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Abualait</surname><given-names>Turki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is defined as a change in brain function or a brain pathology that may be due to an external force. TBI is a major public health issue that contributes to substantial burdens of disability and death throughout the world. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health concern worldwide and contributes to substantial disability and mortality. Globally, TBI is responsible for a considerable increase in the number of emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is most frequently referred to as the &#8220;silent epidemic&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. TBI is an often challenging public health dilemma and contributes greatly to death and disability worldwide through all trauma-related harm or injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is estimated that more than 69&#160;million individuals experience TBI each year worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The incidence rates of TBI can vary from 50 to 200 per 100,000 people per year, depending on the country and region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. TBI-related mortality also varies, with higher rates observed in low- and middle-income countries due to inadequate trauma care and prevention measures. Prior investigations from the United States of America and New Zealand have shown approximately 500 to 800 new instances of TBI per 100,000 individuals per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, estimates of the TBI load from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are limited. A large survey-based study in 8 LMICs indicated that the lifelong occurrence of TBIs ranged from less than 1% in China to approximately 15% in Venezuela and Mexico, with most estimates being rough to those from high-income countries (HICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A road traffic injury monitoring study (where n&#8201;=&#8201;&gt;&#8201;100,000) conducted in Pakistan revealed that approximately 30% of the injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Effective measures to identify trustworthy epidemiological data on the occurrence of disability and mortality from TBI in limited resource settings still need to be obtained.</p><p id="Par3">Trauma results in the activation and release of cellular and molecular factors that lead to cell death, inflammation, and tissue hypoxia; these factors threaten the rearrangement process and are hallmarks of TBI. This condition is often caused by severe road traffic accidents, falls, or violence worldwide. Road traffic accidents are major contributors to TBI in low- and middle-income countries, while falls are the leading cause of TBI among elderly persons in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although TBI can affect anyone, some age groups are more susceptible to this disease. TBIs disproportionately affect adolescents and young adults, predominantly males aged 15&#8211;24 years, predominantly due to high-risk behaviors or road traffic accidents. Moreover, falls in the geriatric population are a major risk factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The current review covers the key advances in pathophysiology, diagnostics, therapeutic interventions, and rehabilitation trends in TBI research while drawing conclusions regarding future directions in TBI care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury</title><p id="Par4">The pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury begins by considering primary and secondary injuries, which result from an immediate physical force acting on neuronal tissue (i.e., primary injurious forces), as occurs in widely known focal or multifocal lesions. Secondary damage can be defined as an array of biochemical and molecular events that follow the initial injury, leading to the exacerbation of the original etiology, thus producing sustained neuronal dysfunction and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">The cellular and molecular consequences of TBI include the death of neurons and glial cells, disruption of the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), and axonal injury. In the acute phase, all the cellular, biochemical, and physiological progress that results from initial trauma will eventually lead to secondary hits over time, which may progress even from hours to years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Secondary injuries are due to mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation, mainly through excess free radical production, as well as cellular inflammation of neurons and axons and programmed cell death via apoptosis. Neuroinflammation includes the activation of microglial and astrocyte cells, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, as in the secondary injury mechanism. Furthermore, neurovascular compromise, such as disturbances in cerebral blood flow and breakdown of the BBB, also contributes to secondary brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] as represented in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p><p id="Par6">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Diagnostic advances in traumatic brain injury</title><p id="Par7">Important strides in diagnostic technologies have improved our ability to diagnose TBIs. Computed tomography (CT) is the most common initial assessment because of its ability to detect hemorrhage as well as fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Alberts and Lucke-Wold (2024) highlighted novel imaging techniques such as advanced MRI sequences (e.g., susceptibility-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging) and CT perfusion that can better detect microbleeds, diffuse axonal injury, and perfusion abnormalities, even in mild TBI cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The advantages of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) include superior sensitivity for detecting diffuse axonal injury and micro hemorrhages. Fludeoxyglucose-18-positron emission tomography fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) studies of metabolism and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies of white matter integrity have also made significant advancements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]as presented in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Potential biomarkers of TBI, such as S100B, GFAP, and UCH-L1, appear to be useful for assessing injury severity and monitoring patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This progress in neuropsychological assessment skills has led to the development of a broad range of cognitive and behavioral assessment tools, allowing for the detection of subtle impairments. The importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing daily along with machine learning-based predictive modeling for analyzing imaging data, which enhances the accuracy and efficiency of diagnostics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">

</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Role of fNIRS in TBI assessment</title><p id="Par9">Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive imaging technique to assess neurovascular and neurocognitive dysfunction following TBI. fNIRS measures changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the cerebral cortex, providing real-time insights into cerebral hemodynamics and neurovascular coupling.</p><p id="Par10">Chang et al. (2024) demonstrated that fNIRS could objectively evaluate executive dysfunction in TBI patients using Stroop and N-back cognitive tasks. In their study, significant alterations in activation patterns were detected in the frontopolar cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting impaired prefrontal function in TBI patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Similarly, Amyot et al. (2024) found that fNIRS, alongside fMRI, can assess cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in chronic TBI patients. Both techniques showed significantly lower CVR in TBI compared to controls, indicating persistent microvascular dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Moreover, Liao et al. (2024) provide a mechanistic basis for these findings, highlighting the utility of fNIRS and related in vivo optical techniques in mapping neurovascular coupling and metabolic changes in both preclinical and clinical TBI studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These insights support the growing clinical relevance of fNIRS as a tool for functional brain monitoring and for tailoring individualized rehabilitation protocols.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Acute management of traumatic brain injury</title><p id="Par13">The goal of acute management is to provide essential care at the initial assessment level from prehospital providers aimed at stabilizing patient conditions and preventing further damage. Recommendations for the management of severe brain injuries include critical emergency surgical and medical interventions, such as the evacuation of hematomas and intracranial pressure reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Neurocritical care services can quickly address emergent issues such as seizures or infections and offer advanced monitoring capabilities, such as intracranial pressure monitoring and cerebral oxygenation management. This strategy is desirable for improving patient outcomes through accurate programming and monitoring of targets such as cerebral perfusion pressure, which is important for guiding treatment and preventing secondary injury in critical care scenarios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Therapeutic strategies for TBI</title><p id="Par14">Pharmacological treatments for TBI include the use of neuroprotective agents such as antioxidants and calcium channel blockers, as well as anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug NSAIDs. These treatments generally aim to slow secondary injury processes, such as inflammation-mediated cell damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Nonpharmacological approaches, such as therapeutic hypothermia, help reduce metabolic demands and inflammation, while hyperbaric oxygen therapy can improve tissue oxygenation levels, which helps in the healing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Recent advances in stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine show promise for neural repair, although clinical trials are ongoing to assess their effectiveness.

Advancements in the field of robotics have led to the introduction of exoskeleton devices that allow patients who are immobile to move by providing support and enhancing movement capabilities during exercise, which can be particularly beneficial for individuals with severe motor disorders. From then, it could be getting on their feet again, although a bit slower in action this time even if not using these devices. However, in a broader way, it guarantees that those who cannot show up at the event can have all but been physically present.

Different types of advanced imaging, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (functional MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), provide additional information on brain injury severity, providing an exact diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These technologies help identify subtle microstructural damage and alterations in network connectivity that are otherwise invisible with conventional imaging techniques. Moreover, there is research on potential TBI diagnostic biomarkers, such as different proteins and genetic markers, that can assist in early or very accurate diagnosis of injury, but these biomarkers are not applicable for monitoring processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Quantifying the extent to which neuromodulatory technologies, e.g., transcranial magnetic or direct current brain stimulation, influence human cognitive and motor function is of paramount importance in terms of developing more effective therapies. Stem cell therapy offers another way to repair brain injury and restore function through the transplantation of neural stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Finally, neurofeedback and brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as potential rehabilitation devices for patients by offering them an original way to modulate sensory motor performance. These advances are blazing new frontiers in regard to the creation of more effective and customized patient-specific TBI care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Emerging role of stem cell therapy in TBI rehabilitation</title><p id="Par28">Stem cell therapy (SCT) represents a rapidly evolving area of interest in the treatment of traumatic brain injury, offering regenerative potential to repair damaged neural tissues and restore function. Early-phase clinical trials, especially those using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have demonstrated encouraging results regarding safety, feasibility, and improved neurological outcomes. These therapies work through various mechanisms including neurogenesis, angiogenesis, immunomodulation, and anti-inflammatory pathways.</p><p id="Par29">Mohamad et al. (2024) highlighted SCT as a beacon of hope for TBI and stroke recovery, particularly in vulnerable and rural populations such as those in South Carolina. The study emphasized that while early trials report positive functional outcomes, replication of these results at scale remains a challenge. Additionally, the incorporation of advanced neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG) and neuromodulatory techniques could improve assessment of post-therapy recovery, although such technologies are not yet widespread in SCT research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">The authors also noted significant barriers to wider adoption, including ethical concerns surrounding cell sourcing, high costs associated with autologous therapies, technical limitations in stem cell delivery and survival, and disparities in access to care. Addressing these limitations is essential to integrating SCT into mainstream clinical rehabilitation pathways for TBI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Personalized medicine in traumatic brain injury (TBI) management</title><p id="Par31">Personalized medicine in TBI management would mean that treatment strategies are custom designed for each patient with reference to their genetic profile and the type and severity of brain injury they have sustained plus comorbid conditions influenced by other major organs. It is known that TBI constitutes a heterogeneous disease, and it differs from individual to patient in terms of the representation of symptoms as well as traumatic brain injury recovery times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Personalized medicine refers to the strategy of using detailed data about an individual patient, including his or her omics profile as well as other factors such as age and environmental exposures, to tailor specific clinical decisions.</p><p id="Par32">At the cellular and molecular levels, genetic and translational analyses are becoming increasingly common and are increasingly common for identifying biomarkers that predict the impact of different treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This approach helps clinicians select the most appropriate therapy for each patient. With respect to medications for managing the symptoms of TBI, such as anxiety, depression, or cognitive impairment, genetic variations may influence how a patient responds to the medications used to manage TBI symptoms, particularly in individual patients. Additionally, advanced higher resolution imaging techniques can provide individualized maps of brain injury, helping to guide targeted interventions such as neuromodulation or specific rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. By integrating these personalized approaches, healthcare providers can develop more precise and effective treatment plans, ultimately improving recovery outcomes and quality of life for TBI patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Roles of big data and machine learning in TBI research</title><p id="Par33">The world has seen two major revolutionary technologies, big data and machine learning (ML), which can reshape the future to explore TBIs through different strategies for handling sophisticated clinical datasets, unearthing cryptic patterns or moving from bedside findings toward identifying the underlying mechanisms involved in traumatic brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Examples of big data include electronic health records, imaging data, genetic information and patient-reported outcomes. Integrating and analyzing these datasets can thereby help researchers identify risk factors for this disease, predict the pathophysiology of TBIs and develop new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="Par34">Machine learning is particularly powerful because it gathers large amounts of data and identifies patterns that might outstrip conventional statistical methods. Using machine learning to predict health outcomes through combining patient demographic, clinical and imaging data can help physicians construct pinpointed treatment decisions or interventions and optimize resource allocation. This ensures that healthcare resources are distributed in a more efficient way. Machine learning models can also help to create new biomarkers for traumatic brain injury (TBI) as part of the development process, whereas they may offer faster and more accurate diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Together, big data and machine learning play an important role in creating a wonderful way that allows researchers to discover something very new, thereby helping them determine their treatment for TBI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Global initiatives and collaborations in TBI research</title><p id="Par35">Global initiatives and collaborations are needed to move forward in TBI research, fostering the exchange of information as an intellectual asset for the greater good. Collaborative research allows larger-scale data sharing, standardizing of protocols, optimizing techniques and maximizing the performance of large-scale research that can far exceed what any single institution could hopefully accomplish on its own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. One prominent example is the International Initiative for Traumatic Brain Injury Research (InTBIR), a collaboration of The National Institutes of Health supported by other federal agencies and international funders, including the European Commission and Canadian Institutes of Health Research that integrates research funding across administrative boundaries. The full name of the project is the International Initiative for Traumatic Brain Injury Research (InTBIR). Copyright Information aims to foster global research collaboration and data sharing for a better understanding and treatment of TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">A large observational study across multiple sites in the USA to collect and analyze data from TBI patients, known as TRACK-TBI, is also important. The involvement of multiple institutions (i.e., from academia, healthcare providers, and industry partners) is aimed at offering a holistic picture of the TBI dataset that can be obtained to guide further research in this field as well as clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The Global Brain Health Institute (GBHI) has also been determined to solve the problems of brain injury and neurodegenerative disorders, for which global collaboration, research efforts, and policy actions are crucial. Globally based collaborations allow for sharing best practices, setting guidelines, and disseminating results from research strategies, driving the pace of clinical TBI work forward and thus benefiting patient care at all levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par37">As a result, substantial advances in science have been made in the field of traumatic brain injury research and management, particularly in the areas of pathophysiology comprehension, improved diagnostic techniques, and therapeutic strategy development. Technological developments and a multidisciplinary approach have proven beneficial for rehabilitation and recovery. Building on this success will require additional research and international cooperation, underscoring the significance of individualized, multidisciplinary treatment strategies targeted at patient-centered outcomes in TBI patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
