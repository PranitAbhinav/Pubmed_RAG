However, nostalgic music preferences vary from person to person, presenting challenges for applying nostalgia-based music interventions in clinical settings, such as a non-pharmacological approach. To address these individual differences, we developed the Nostalgia Brain-Music Interface (N-BMI), a neurofeedback system that recommends nostalgic songs tailored to each individual. This system is based on prediction models of nostalgic feelings, developed by integrating subjective nostalgia ratings, acoustic features and in-ear electroencephalographic (EEG) data during song listening. To test the effects of N-BMI on nostalgic feelings, state-level well-being, and memory recall, seventeen older and sixteen younger participants took part in the study. The N-BMI was personalized for each individual, and songs were recommended under two conditions: the &#8220;nostalgic condition&#8220;, where songs were selected to enhance nostalgic feelings, and the &#8220;non-nostalgic condition&#8220;, to reduce nostalgic feelings. We found nostalgic feelings, state-level well-being, and subjective memory vividness were significantly higher after listening to the recommended songs in the nostalgic condition compared to the non-nostalgic condition in both groups. This indicates that the N-BMI enhanced nostalgic feelings, state-level well-being, and memory recall across both groups. The N-BMI paves the way for innovative therapeutic interventions, including non-pharmacological approaches.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-14705-6.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Brain-computer interface</kwd><kwd>Nostalgia</kwd><kwd>Music</kwd><kwd>Well-being</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Health care</kwd><kwd>Neural decoding</kwd><kwd>Cognitive ageing</kwd><kwd>Emotion</kwd><kwd>Neuroscience</kwd><kwd>Long-term memory</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Towa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">The global population continues to grow and age rapidly. The proportion of the global population 60&#8201;+&#8201;years old is predicted to reach about 22% in 2050 and about 32% in 2100<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, from a public health perspective, supporting &#8220;healthy aging&#8221; is an important issue in modern society<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Healthy aging is defined as the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables well-being in older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Nostalgia is considered a psychological resource that can support healthy aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Nostalgia is a bittersweet emotional experience associated with recollections of the past, and this emotion is frequently experienced in everyday life and across age and cultural boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Nostalgia has negative aspects but is mainly perceived as a positive emotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Nostalgic experience also has been associated with a reduction in loneliness and an increase in self-esteem, self-continuity, and optimism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Also, nostalgic reminiscence is known to enhance psychological resources by acting as a buffer against anxiety arising from existential threats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, nostalgia is also known to contribute to improving psychological well-being in older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, nostalgia is a self-related emotion strongly linked to the recall of memories experienced by the self<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Memory loss, one of the cognitive impairments, is frequently reported with aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Nostalgic experience is associated with improved recall and recognition of self-relevant memories in older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, nostalgia may also contribute to the maintenance of cognitive function in healthy aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Nostalgia can be triggered by various senses such as sight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>,smell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and taste<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> but nostalgia induced by music may enhance the effects of these nostalgic functions more effectively. Music is known to have effects such as lowering cortisol levels and reducing stress, as well as decreasing negative emotions and evoking positive ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, nostalgia through music may be more effective in promoting the well-being of older adults. Indeed, music-evoked nostalgia also has psychological benefits, serving a similar buffering function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Additionally, research shows that music can help preserve long-term memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and because it is deeply integrated into daily life, musical memories are often associated with personal experiences and events. Thus, music can serve as a trigger for autobiographical memories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Music that is closely tied to an individual&#8217;s past is known to promote spontaneous recall of memories in older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. It is possible that nostalgic music may be effective in supporting the recall of memories in older adults.</p><p id="Par6">Nostalgic music may be useful not only for healthy aging but also as an intervention for dementia prevention. While the growing prevalence of dementia, pharmacological treatments remain challenging, due to the complex nature of the disease and associated side effects of the treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), such as depression and anxiety, are significant concerns in dementia care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Among the various music-based approaches for addressing cognitive symptoms, listening to music has been shown to alleviate these symptoms and enhance psychological health and overall well-being<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The evocation of nostalgia functions as a psychological resource for individuals with dementia and has also been confirmed to provide mnemonic benefits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. This effect of nostalgic music is especially significant in clinical settings, where it can serve as a valuable intervention tool for individuals with dementia who often face existential threats due to their condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Memory loss is a primary symptom of dementia, as well as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition often seen as a precursor to dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The phenomenon of maintaining long-term memory and autobiographical recall has been observed even in individuals with severe memory impairment, suggesting that music may play a significant role in slowing the progression of memory disorders in people with dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Thus, nostalgic music could be effective in helping people with their recollections.</p><p id="Par7">However, the impact of nostalgic music varies from person to person, as music-induced nostalgia depends on personal characteristics, contextual factors like emotional experience with the music, memory states, and the interaction of these factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. For instance, previous research suggest that music-evoked nostalgia is associated with arousal and the intensity of affective valence; however, the strength of relationship between nostalgia and valence intensity is modulated by mood state, one of the individual traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Personalized music listening has also been recommended in conventional approaches for people with dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. By not only playing an individual&#8217;s nostalgic songs but also quantitatively assessing the emotional state associated with each song during selection, it may be possible to maximize the feeling of nostalgia and make it more effective as a form of care for individuals with older adults.</p><p id="Par8">To address individual differences, we developed a Nostalgia Brain-Music Interface (N-BMI), designed to enhance feelings of nostalgia by recommending songs tailored to each individual based on prediction models of nostalgic feelings. We tested this interface on healthy younger and older adults. These models were built using rating data on subjective nostalgia, acoustic features of self-selected and other-selected nostalgic songs, and in-ear electroencephalographic (EEG) activity recorded while listening to the songs. The development of the N-BMI was inspired by previous research on EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). For instance, BCIs have been shown to modify music according to an individual&#8217;s estimated arousal and valence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> or to mediate emotions by generating personalized music<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> highlighting the potential for recommending personalized music through EEG activity analysis. By decoding user preferences directly from EEG signals, real-time updates of personalized song recommendation can be made in an annotation-free manner. Thus, the Nostalgia Brain-Music Interface minimizes the need for explicit, cognitively demanding user feedback. Additionally, a prior study demonstrated that neural activation related to nostalgia can be predicted by personality traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> suggesting the feasibility of developing a neurofeedback system based on nostalgia-related brain activity. However, no research to date has developed a neurofeedback system specifically targeting nostalgia or examined its effects on nostalgia, well-being, and memory retrieval. Therefore, our goal was to develop the N-BMI and evaluate whether the songs recommended by the N-BMI could enhance nostalgic feelings, well-being, and memory recall in both younger and older individuals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2222"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Nostalgia Brain-Music Interface (N-BMI)</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Overview</title><p id="Par12">The proposed Nostalgia Brain-Music Interface (N-BMI) consisted of three steps, referred to as &#8216;Rec-Dec-Back&#8217;: (1) recording, (2) decoding, and (3) feedback (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Before the experiment, participants selected three nostalgic songs. During the recording step, they listened to both self-selected and other-selected songs and rated their subjective feelings of nostalgia, state-level well-being, and subjective memory vividness. EEG activity was recorded using an in-ear EEG device (VIE Inc., Kanagawa, Japan) while participants listened to both self-selected and other-selected songs.</p><p id="Par13">In the decoding step, two models were created using MATLAB 2023b software <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com">https://www.mathworks.com</ext-link><italic toggle="yes">)</italic>: Model 1, the &#8216;Nostalgia Prediction Model,&#8217; utilized nostalgia ratings and the acoustic features of self-selected and other-selected songs, to predict subjective nostalgic rating. The acoustic features were extracted using the VGGish model, a pretrained convolutional neural network developed by Google<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. It has been shown that the CNN model&#8217;s embedding is more sensitive to emotional responses than low-level acoustic features, and we thought it would be appropriate for use in N-BMI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Model 2, the &#8216;Nostalgia Decoder,&#8217; employed Fourier-transformed multidimensional EEG power-frequency data recorded while participants listened to the self-selected and other-selected songs. This model decoded nostalgic feelings from the EEG data by estimating whether the EEG pattern was more similar to those recorded during self-selected song listening or other-selected song listening.</p><p id="Par14">In the feedback step, Model 1 predicted the participant&#8217;s nostalgic feeling and recommended a song from a pool of 7,481 songs to either enhance or reduce their nostalgia. While the participant listened to the recommended song, Model 2 decoded their nostalgic feeling every 20&#160;s. The decoded nostalgia and the acoustic features of the recommended song were then added as new supervised inputs to update Model 1. The updated Model 1 predicted the nostalgic feeling again and recommended another song from the pool. During the feedback step, each song was played for 20&#160;s, the model was updated every 20&#160;s, and a total of six songs were played over 120&#160;s (two minutes). After listening to the recommended songs, participants rated their nostalgic feelings, state-level well-being, and subjective memory vividness (see Recording in the Nostalgia Brain-Machine-Interface (N-BMI) section).</p><p id="Par15">

The N-BMI followed a three-step process called &#8216;Rec-Dec-Back,&#8217; which refers to (1) recording, (2) decoding, and (3) feedback. During the recording step, participants listened to both self-selected and other-selected nostalgic songs and rated their subjective feelings of nostalgia, state-level well-being, and subjective memory vividness, while EEG activity was simultaneously recorded using an in-ear EEG device. In the decoding step, two models were developed: Model 1, the &#8216;Nostalgia Prediction Model,&#8217; which utilized nostalgia ratings and the acoustic features of self-selected and other-selected songs extracted through the VGGish model; and Model 2, the &#8216;Nostalgia Decoder,&#8217; which analyzed Fourier-transformed EEG power-frequency data recorded during song listening. Model 2 decoded nostalgic feelings by estimating whether the EEG patterns more closely matched those recorded during self-selected or other-selected song listening. In the feedback step, Model 1 predicted the participant&#8217;s nostalgic feelings and recommended a song from a pool of 7,481 songs to either enhance or reduce nostalgia. While the participant listened to the recommended song, Model 2 decoded nostalgic feelings, and both the decoded nostalgia and the song&#8217;s acoustic features were used to update Model 1. The updated Model 1 then predicted nostalgic feelings again and recommended another song from the pool. After listening to the recommended songs, participants rated their nostalgic feelings, state-level well-being, and subjective memory vividness.</p></caption><graphic id="d33e507" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="41598_2025_14705_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig>

(Kanagawa, Japan, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.vie.style/">https://www.vie.style/</ext-link><italic toggle="yes">)</italic>, which records EEG data from the left and right ear canals using ear-tip-shaped electrodes, with reference electrodes placed at the back of the neck. The system records data from the left and right ear channels, as well as the difference signal between the two channels, to exclude noise from the common reference electrode signals. The ear-tip design allows for simultaneous recording of EEG signals and music playback. A previous study confirmed the similarity between in-ear EEG signals and temporal EEG signals measured by a conventional EEG device (Brain Amp DC, BrainVision, Canada)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">The in-ear EEG data were recorded at a sampling frequency of 600&#160;Hz and filtered using a fourth-order Butterworth filter with a frequency range of 3 to 40&#160;Hz. The recorded data from the left and right channels, along with the difference-signal data, were segmented into 4-second time windows with 50% overlap. A Fourier transform was applied to each segment for each time-series data (i.e., left, right, and difference signal). EEG power across the 4&#8211;40&#160;Hz bands was calculated in 0.5&#160;Hz steps.</p><p id="Par19">To detect noise, we performed two steps. First, to remove common noise between the two channels and over time, such as noise from eye movements, we applied independent component analysis (ICA) to the EEG data from the left and right channels. One of the components, which had the larger root mean square (RMS) value of the two components, was labeled as noise and removed from the filtered data. Second, to remove independent noise from each channel or time segment, we calculated a noise flag for each segment. This flag was estimated by taking the average value of the sum of the power spectral density, RMS, maximum gradient, and kurtosis, each of which was transformed to a z-score. The resulting mean value was considered an absolute amplitude value. If this amplitude value was larger than 2.5, the noise flag was set to 1; if smaller, the noise flag was set to 0. This calculation was applied separately to the right and left channel data. We used only the epochs without noise flags. Noise quantification and rejection were performed for each segment based on criteria from a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">For the extraction of the EEG components, the power-transformed data from the left and right ear channels, along with the difference signal, were combined horizontally and compressed to a maximum of 150 dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA). If the number of these dimensions was less than 150, we used all the components. These dimensional data were then used to create Model 2, the &#8216;Nostalgia Decoder,&#8217; which decoded the participants&#8217; nostalgic state.</p></sec><sec id="Sec55556"><title>Recording in the Nostalgia Brain-Machine Interface (N-BMI)</title><p id="Par22">Younger participants were instructed to bring three songs that made them feel nostalgic prior to the experiment. Older participants were asked to choose from a list of songs already on hand, that were popular when they were 15 years old, a period commonly associated with heightened autobiographical salience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This approach was adopted because older participants were expected to have cognitive burden when recalling nostalgic songs, and because it was necessary to obtain all songs on the day of the experiment, while options for accessing older music were limited.</p><p id="Par23">Participants wore in-ear EEG devices. During the recording step of the N-BMI, they listened to three self-selected nostalgic songs and three other-selected songs (six songs in total). To make extreme conditions of nostalgic and non-nostalgic states, other-selected songs in both younger and older participants are chosen within a participant in the younger group randomly. Each song was played for 45&#160;s from the beginning, with the order of the songs randomized. EEG data were recorded while participants listened to the six songs. After each song, participants rated their nostalgic feelings, state-level well-being, and subjective memory vividness using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 (0&#8201;=&#8201;Not at all, 100&#8201;=&#8201;Strongly). The VAS was displayed on a personal computer (PC), and participants were asked to enter their ratings. For older participants who had difficulty using the PC, a printed version of the VAS was provided, and they indicated their rating by pointing to the desired value on the paper, which the experimenter then inputted into the PC.</p><p id="Par24">For the rating of nostalgic feelings, we used one item: (i) &#8216;I felt nostalgic,&#8217; which participants answered on the VAS. In the study, we presented &#8220;Natsukashii&#8221; in Japanese to participants scale based on the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Regarding as well-being, in this study, we define state-level well-being as positive emotional states related to mental health characterized by feelings such as cheerfulness, interest, and enjoyment of life, consistent with previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we selected items from an abbreviated version of the 38-item Mental Health Inventory, the MHI-18<sup>61</sup>, which assesses mental health with a focus on emotional state-level well-being. For our study, we extracted eight items that contribute to the emotional state-level well-being score: (i) &#8216;I was interested,&#8217; (ii) &#8216;I felt loved and needed by others,&#8217; (iii) &#8216;I had proper non-nostalgic over my actions, thoughts, and feelings,&#8217; (iv) &#8216;I felt calm and peaceful,&#8217; (v) &#8216;I was emotionally calm,&#8217; (vi) &#8216;I was relaxed without problems,&#8217; (vii) &#8216;I was cheerful and lighthearted,&#8217; and (viii) &#8216;I was a happy person&#8217;. MHI-18 measures mental health, containing the two concepts of psychological distress (e.g., symptoms of anxiety and depression) and psychological state-level well-being (e.g., feeling cheerful, interest in and enjoyment of life), which is widely used for mental health assessments. We have extracted items related to the total score in the scale. As subjective memory vividness, participants rated how strongly they felt they had retrieved a memory. For the rating of subjective memory vividness, we used three items: (i) &#8216;The overall memory of the event is extremely clear,&#8217; (ii) &#8216;The memory of the event is extremely detailed,&#8217; and (iii) &#8216;Overall, I remember the event clearly.&#8217; These items were retrieved from the Japanese version of the Memory Characteristics Questionnaire (MCQ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> which were related to the Clarity factor in the scale. Participants responded to these questions based on memories that came to mind while listening to the recently played song. If the participants could not remember anything, they were instructed to answer 0.</p><p id="Par25">All older participants used a printed version of the VAS, and a shorter version of the state-level well-being and subjective memory vividness scales was administered based on the results of a small pilot study for older participants. In the pilot study, older adults took about 1&#160;h to complete all procedure of the experiment with shorten questionnaires and showed signs of fatigue. Since the experiment needs to be conducted within a limited time frame at a facility, we reduced the number of items to minimize burden and ensure completion. Specifically, they answered three items for state-level well-being: (i) &#8216;I was interested,&#8217; (iv) &#8216;I felt calm and peaceful,&#8217; and (vii) &#8216;I was cheerful and lighthearted,&#8217; and one item for subjective memory vividness: (iii) &#8216;Overall, I remember the event clearly.&#8217; This modification was implemented to accommodate older participants, as they had difficulty using a computer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3345"><title>Decoding in the Nostalgia Brain-Machine Interface (N-BMI)</title><sec id="Sec33344"><title>Model 1: Nostalgia Prediction Model</title><p id="Par28">Model 1 (the Nostalgia Prediction Model) consisted of a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model that predicted nostalgic feelings based on acoustic features. Model 1 was developed using nostalgia ratings and acoustic feature data collected during the recording phase, which values were standardized to z-scored. Acoustic features were calculated using the VGGish model, which transforms audio inputs into spectrograms and extracts 128 dimensions of acoustic features. Each of the six songs played had a duration of 45&#160;s, and VGGish transformed this song data into a matrix with 128 acoustic feature dimensions as columns and 184 time frames as rows&#8212;the number of time frames being determined independently by VGGish based on the song&#8217;s duration. An average value was then calculated for every 10-second segment for each dimension. These features were subsequently z-scored using the mean and standard deviation of the acoustic features from the songs in our music database (7,481 songs used in the feedback phase of the N-BMI, see below). If the standard deviation of a normalized feature exceeded an absolute value of 2, it was capped at 2 or -2. To reduce dimensionality, only the normalized features with a standard deviation greater than 0.01 were retained, as features below this threshold were considered to provide minimal informational value. Each segment was paired with nostalgia ratings for the corresponding piece of music, and this data was used as training data for Model 1.</p><p id="Par29">Thus, this nostalgia prediction model can be described as:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="d33e569">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

All participants were given both oral and written explanations of the experiment, and each provided written informed consent.

The experimenter then moistened and cleaned each participant&#8217;s ears and the back of their necks, where electrodes were attached, before placing the in-ear EEG device.</p><p id="Par56">Participants then listened to six songs&#8212;three self-selected and three chosen by others&#8212;in random order (&#8220;Recording&#8221; in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The music for the older adult group had acoustic characteristics such as sound quality reminiscent of analog recordings, which could evoke a sense of nostalgia in the younger group through associations with the past. Thus, in the younger group, for each participant, we randomly selected another participant in the same group and assigned that participant&#8217;s three self-selected songs as the other-selected songs. In the older group, results of our pilot study indicated that participants often felt nostalgic for many of the self-selected songs of other participants in the same age group. This made it difficult to establish a non-nostalgic state, which was essential for decoder construction. Therefore, to minimize this effect, we assigned the self-selected songs of a randomly chosen participant from the younger group as the other-selected songs. After listening to each song, participants rated their nostalgic feelings, state-level well-being, and subjective memory vividness (see details above). In-ear EEG signals were recorded while participants listened to the songs. Using this data, Models 1 and 2 were generated and their accuracy for each participant was evaluated (&#8220;Decoding&#8221; in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

If so, this phenomenon may be caused by the familiarity based on the similarity to their nostalgic songs.</p><p id="Par92">According to the dual-process model of recognition memory, recognition judgement consists of two distinct cognitive processes, &#8220;recollection&#8221; and &#8220;familiarity&#8221;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Recollection involves retrieving specific details about a past event, while familiarity refers to a general sense that something has been encountered before, without recalling specific details<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Recollection operates through a threshold process, meaning it either occurs fully or not at all<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup> and involves conscious retrieval of past events. In contrast, familiarity is shaped by how well the features of a stimulus match previous experiences, with memory traces strengthening gradually through accumulated exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par93">Since Model 1 in our N-BMI algorithm recommended songs based on acoustic feature similarity, the features of recommended songs matched those of self-selected nostalgic songs that were tied to past experiences. One possible explanation is that the songs recommended by the N-BMI might have evoked nostalgic feelings and enhanced subjective memory vividness primarily through the familiarity process rather than recollection. It could be thought that the recommended songs, with similar acoustic features to participants&#8217; nostalgic songs, may have helped participants access more detailed past memories. This access to memory also could have increased the sense of accumulated familiarity, thereby evoking nostalgic feelings and enhancing subjective memory vividness. However, the study did not measure familiarity with the music, so further experiments are needed to verify the explanation.</p><p id="Par94">The N-BMI not only enhanced subjective memory vividness but also improved state-level well-being in both younger and older participants. These results are consistent with previous research highlighting the role of music and nostalgia in promoting psychological health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In the future, it may be interesting to examine whether the N-BMI not only enhances state-level well-being but also reinforces feelings of social connectedness, increases self-esteem, and reduces negative affect.</p><p id="Par95">Taken together, we suggest that the N-BMI has the potential to evoke nostalgia, enhance memory, and improve state-level well-being by recommending songs from a database, even when participants had no prior listening experience with those songs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec347"><title>Age-related differences in enhancing and decoding nostalgia</title><p id="Par97">We found that VAS ratings for nostalgic feelings, state-level well-being, and subjective memory vividness were significantly higher after listening to the recommended songs in the nostalgic condition compared to the non-nostalgic condition for both younger and older participants (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). However, as indicated by the results of a mixed-design ANOVA, the effect of N-BMI on nostalgia, state-level well-being, and subjective memory vividness depended on age differences. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test also showed that the effects were larger for older participants than for younger participants. Thus, although the N-BMI effectively enhanced subjective nostalgic feelings, state-level well-being, and subjective memory vividness in both age groups, its effect was greater for the older population than for the younger population.</p><p id="Par98">This age-related difference was also reflected in the accuracy of Model 2, the Nostalgia Decoder. Specifically, the mean decoded nostalgia was significantly higher in the nostalgic condition than in the non-nostalgic condition for older participants (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B), suggesting that the EEG pattern during the nostalgic condition more closely aligned with that observed while listening to self-selected nostalgic songs. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the mean decoded nostalgia between the two conditions in the younger adult group (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Thus, the age-related differences in the decoded nostalgia results correspond to those observed in the VAS ratings.</p><p id="Par99">We propose at least four factors to explain these age-related differences. First, variation in acoustic features between older and more recent songs in our music database may have influenced the results. Our database included popular Japanese songs in the hit chart from 2018 to 2023, likely familiar to younger participants, and songs from the 1920s to 1980s, familiar to older participants. Since songs from different eras possess distinct acoustic features, this likely affected the music recommendation process. For older participants, older songs from their youth were ranked higher, while recent songs were ranked lower (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B), leading to the recommendation of recent songs in the non-nostalgic condition. It is plausible that older participants did not experience nostalgia in the non-nostalgic condition because recent songs are less likely to evoke nostalgia. Conversely, for younger participants, recent songs were ranked higher, while older songs were ranked lower, leading to the recommendation of older songs in the non-nostalgic condition. Younger participants may have still experienced nostalgia in the non-nostalgic condition, as older songs could be linked to cultural or collective memory. For instance, musical preferences are influenced by the music that was popular during our parents&#8217; adolescence, a phenomenon known as the cascading reminiscence bump<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. If younger participants were familiar with nostalgic stories related to older songs or had been exposed to those songs at an early age, they may have experienced nostalgia from them, thereby diminishing the difference between the nostalgia and non-nostalgic conditions.</p><p id="Par100">Second, in the recording step, while the other-selected songs for the older group were chosen by participants from the younger group, those for the younger group were selected by another participant within the same group. This difference in the selection process for other-selected songs may have contributed to the distinct neural responses between nostalgic and non-nostalgic states, potentially influencing the accuracy of the decoder. The difference of decoded nostalgia between conditions were only significant in the older group. Because other-selected song in the younger group was chosen in same younger group, it is possible that younger participants felt more nostalgic to other-selected songs than older adults. In the feedback step, songs were recommended based on the decoder&#8217;s output. Thus, the difference in how other-selected songs were chosen between age groups may have contributed to the age-related differences in subjective ratings of the recommended songs.</p><p id="Par101">Third, age-related differences in response styles may also have influenced the results. Previous study suggest that aging and cognitive decline may be associated with a tendency toward more extreme response styles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. In the present study, a similar tendency might be visually inferred from the subjective evaluations of older adults, as shown in Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. Since the VAS data collected during the recording phase was used to construct Model 1 (the Nostalgia Prediction Model), such a potential bias could have partially contributed to the relatively higher accuracy of the model for older participants compared to younger participants. It can be possible that this tendency might also help account for the more pronounced differences observed in VAS ratings during the feedback phase.</p><p id="Par102">Finally, age-related differences in the subjective vividness of memory recall may have influenced the results. Older adults have been shown to exhibit reduced contextual detail in autobiographical memory compared to younger adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. However, the subjective vividness of recollected memories&#8212;including music-evoked memories&#8212;may be comparable between older and younger adults, or even greater in older adults than in younger ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is possible that a similar pattern may have occurred in the present study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec123"><title>Limitation and future directions</title><p id="Par104">This study has several limitations in terms of generalizability. The sample size was relatively small, and all older participants were recruited from a day care center, which may limit the diversity of the sample. In addition, certain methodological differences between age groups discussed below may have influenced the results. These factors should be taken into account when interpreting the findings, and caution is warranted in drawing broad conclusions.</p><p id="Par105">Our study used a music database consisting of 7,481 songs from music chart in 2018&#8211;2023 for younger participants and 600 songs from 1920s to the 1980s for older participants. This discrepancy in the number and the range of released year of available songs may have influenced the results for younger participants. This song database is large, and many of the songs were from around 2018 to 2023. Thus, this database reduces the likelihood of encountering personally familiar songs, which may, in turn, reduce the evocation of nostalgia. Since familiar songs are more likely to elicit nostalgic responses than unfamiliar ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> it is possible that this limitation diminished the effect of N-BMI. Thus, N-BMI will be more effective when a more diverse song pool in time would be used.</p><p id="Par106">Also, older participants had to select from a list, while younger adults were allowed to self-select their nostalgic songs on their own. Since the selection was not completely self-selected, the results can only be interpreted to a limited extent as self-selected vs. other-selected. This difference may also contribute to the results. We assumed that songs selected through free recall would evoke more nostalgia than songs limited to a list, but the results showed that the N-BMI effect was smaller in younger participants compared to older participants. Therefore, we consider the impact on the results of this study to be small. On the other hand, it is possible that selecting songs from a list made it difficult to immediately recall nostalgic situations, thereby effectively creating a nostalgic atmosphere. If a more personalized approach is desired, song selection through free recall may be important.</p><p id="Par107">Furthermore, it should be noted that a shortened version of the questionnaire was used for the older adult group in this study. These methodological differences may be related to the results obtained.</p><p id="Par108">In addition, the usefulness of Model 1 and Model 2 was not evaluated separately because this was not the primary focus of the study. Future research is needed to verify their effectiveness, determine the extent to which N-BMI offers benefits compared to conventional music selection based on acoustic similarity in music distribution services, and further improve N-BMI. In this context, one might also wonder how much added value Model 2 provides beyond Model 1. In another study using similar algorithms on music-induced chills, we have demonstrated that combining acoustic and EEG features (Model 1&#8201;+&#8201;Model 2) improves predictive accuracy compared to using acoustic features alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. However, it remains unclear whether the same advantage holds for predicting music-evoked nostalgia, and further investigation is warranted.</p><p id="Par109">A potential future direction is applying the N-BMI to people with dementia and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Because N-BMI has a low cognitive load due to not having to select nostalgic songs through free recall, the results of this study suggest that the interface could be particularly beneficial for individuals with severe memory impairments, making it a promising area for future research. Additionally, the N-BMI may hold potential as a non-pharmacological approach to dementia prevention, offering a feasible, and low-side-effect option that can be implemented at home. For example, if a product incorporating this system were to be developed, users would first need to input nostalgic songs. As a result, the difficulty of independent use by individuals with dementia may vary depending on the severity of their symptoms. However, when used with the support of family members or medical staff at home or in daycare settings, the system is expected to demonstrate its maximum effectiveness.</p><p id="Par110">Another future direction is to apply the N-BMI in broader contexts. Since the N-BMI offers a new way of recommending music using an in-ear EEG device, it could be easily adapted for use in the general population in daily life. It has the potential to enhance nostalgia, subjective memory vividness, and state-level in individuals across various demographics. Future studies could explore its impact on emotional health in diverse populations. The development of such technologies could provide significant benefits for individuals with memory and emotional regulation challenges, paving the way for innovative therapeutic interventions in a wider range of contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par111">We developed the Nostalgia Brain-Music Interface (N-BMI) and demonstrated that it enhanced nostalgic feelings, state-level well-being, and memory recall in both younger and older individuals.
