While passive immunotherapy with anti-ricin antibodies shows promise in preclinical studies, no approved countermeasure exists. Developing effective monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is challenging, requiring epitope targeting that ensures neutralization of the two most dominant natural ricin isoforms (D and E). Moreover, high-affinity binding does not always correlate with toxin neutralization, highlighting the importance of epitope specificity in driving protection. Here, we characterized a panel of 17 anti-ricin antibodies, including VHH and IgG mAbs, to determine their affinities, selectivity, and epitopes. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and biolayer interferometry (BLI), we evaluated antibody affinities for the two ricin isoforms (D and E), as well as for ricin agglutinin, a related lectin with markedly lower toxicity. Epitope determination was performed using (1) SPR-based epitope binning, enhanced by network analysis for streamlined bin visualization, and (2) deep mutational scanning with yeast surface display to identify key epitope residues. BLI effectively distinguished low- and high-affinity interactions, while SPR provided superior resolution for determining the highest affinities and lowest dissociation rates. Both epitope-mapping strategies yielded highly consistent results, allowing the identification of critical epitopes associated with potent neutralization and cross-reactivity between ricin isoforms. This study advances our understanding of ricin neutralization by this panel of antibodies, providing key insights into their affinity, epitope specificity, and cross-reactivity. These findings contribute to the rational design of antibody-based therapeutics for ricin intoxication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Yeast surface display</kwd><kwd>epitope mapping</kwd><kwd>surface plasmon resonance</kwd><kwd>biolayer interferometry</kwd><kwd>ricin</kwd><kwd>monoclonal antibodies</kwd><kwd>deep mutational scanning</kwd><kwd>epitope binning</kwd></kwd-group><support-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Federal Ministry of Education and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13N15462</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union&#8217;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>740189</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [project number 13N15462 to B.G.D.] and the French ANR [project number ANR-20-SEBM-0001] in the bilateral French-German research project &#8220;PLANT&#8221; and partly by the European Union&#8217;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [EuroBioTox project, Grant Agreement no. 740189, to B.G.D and S.S.].

It has been used in a number of poisoning incidents,<sup><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> including suicide attempts and small-scale criminal attacks, and incorporated into improvised explosive devices in attempted acts of bioterrorism.<sup><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>The toxicity of ricin is mediated by two distinct chains: the A chain (RTA), which exhibits ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) enzymatic activity, and the B chain (RTB), which functions as a lectin. The two chains are linked by an interchain disulfide bond, forming a toxin with a molecular weight of 64 kDa. Ricin exists in two natural isoforms (D and E) that share 94.3% sequence identity, with identical A chains and minor variations limited to specific regions of the B chain.<sup><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3&#8211;5</xref></sup> Ricin agglutinin, another related but less toxic lectin derived from <italic toggle="yes">Ricinus communis</italic>, shares approximately 89% sequence identity with ricin isoform D.<sup><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> RTB plays a crucial role in facilitating cellular uptake by binding to terminal galactose residues on glycoproteins and glycolipids on the cell surface, thereby enabling the internalization of the toxin. Subsequently, ricin is transported to early endosomes, where the majority of the protein is either recycled back to the cell surface or directed to lysosomes for degradation. Nevertheless, a minor proportion of the protein evades degradation and is conveyed via retrograde transport through the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the A and B chains are separated. From the ER, the A chain is translocated to the cytoplasm, where it exerts its catalytic activity<sup><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. RTA catalyzes the hydrolysis of an adenine residue in the sarcin-ricin loop of the 28S rRNA, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and ultimately leading to cell death<sup><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p><p>At present, there are no approved and commercially available therapeutic countermeasures for ricin poisoning. The only recombinant vaccines, RVEc<sup>TM</sup> and RiVax&#174;, which are based on RTA, are still in clinical development<sup><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and are not suited for post-exposure treatment due to the time required to generate a protective immune response. Potential post-exposure strategies include the use of small molecule inhibitors and passive immunotherapy with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies.<sup><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Of these, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as a particularly promising approach due to their high specificity and potential for effective neutralization of ricin, both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14&#8211;21</xref></sup> Nevertheless, although numerous ricin-specific mAbs have been characterized, none have entered clinical trials or been approved for clinical use. The precise mechanisms by which antibodies neutralize ricin remain incompletely understood, but two principal modes of action have been proposed. First, antibodies can prevent the toxin from binding to cell surface receptors, thereby blocking its internalization. Second, they can disrupt ricin&#8217;s intracellular trafficking, inhibiting its transport to the trans-Golgi network and subsequent downstream processes.<sup><xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22&#8211;24</xref></sup></p><p>Many RTA-specific antibodies predominantly influence intracellular trafficking. These antibodies (e.g., PB10, SyH7, GD12, IB2), targeting various epitopes, lead to accumulation of ricin in late endosomes and lysosomes, thereby reducing the amount of ricin that reaches the TGN or the ER and ultimately the cytosol.<sup><xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Depending on their epitope, RTB-specific antibodies may either prevent cellular entry, as observed with SyH3, JB4, and RB37, or impair intracellular trafficking, as demonstrated by 24B11, which targets a distinct, though uncharacterized, epitope.<sup><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Hence, binding to diverse epitopes by different mAbs allows them to intervene at multiple stages of ricin&#8217;s entry and trafficking, offering potentially complementary neutralization strategies.</p><p>In addition to targeting a relevant epitope, two other key parameters are critical for effective ricin-neutralizing antibodies: 1) high affinity for the antigen and 2) cross-reactivity with both natural ricin isoforms, ricin D and E. While some antibodies, such as PB10, can neutralize ricin despite having moderate affinity (40&#8201;nM)<sup><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> by targeting a critical epitope, others with high affinity fail to neutralize the toxin effectively due to binding outside of neutralizing epitopes, illustrating that each parameter is necessary, but not sufficient on its own. Moreover, some antibodies that neutralize ricin <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> do not provide <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> protection, particularly in cases of severe intoxication when treatment is delayed.<sup><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Therefore, understanding the precise molecular interactions defined by both the affinities between ricin-specific mAbs and ricin and the exact binding epitopes is essential for the development of effective therapies.</p><p>To address these challenges, we used an optimized pipeline combining biophysical methods, namely surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and biolayer interferometry (BLI), to efficiently characterize a panel of 17 mAb candidates against ricin D, ricin E, and agglutinin. This integrated pipeline enabled precise measurements of binding kinetics and affinities, allowing rapid and accurate assessment of antibody interactions. Using SPR-based epitope binning, we grouped the antibodies based on their binding epitopes, while high-resolution epitope maps were generated through yeast surface display coupled with deep mutational scanning (DMS) to identify, at the amino acid level, the ricin residues involved in functional recognition. The SPR analysis ranked the antibodies by binding affinity, with the strongest candidates exhibiting affinities as low as 50 pM. Consistent epitope mapping results across methods revealed six unique, partially overlapping epitope bins. This streamlined approach facilitates efficient characterization and supports the targeted selection and further testing of individual mAbs and oligoclonal cocktails for <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> applications, advancing the development of potent therapeutic antibodies against ricin toxin.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="s0002-s2001"><title>Antibodies and toxins</title><p>Binding kinetics and epitopes were determined for a panel of 17 mAbs targeting ricin (Supp. Table S1).

A) mAbs are immobilized via mouse or human specific anti-species capture antibodies. Unoccupied binding sites on the capture antibodies are blocked before ricin is injected, for which sample binding levels are recorded. Finally, the injection of enhancement antibodies leads to the enhancement binding levels. For non-overlapping epitopes, additional binding is observed, while for overlapping epitopes, mutual binding blockage prevents additional binding. B) to account for slight differences between the capture, sample, and enhancement levels of different antibodies, binding responses are normalized. For each capture mAb tested, enhancement responses after injection of enhancement mAbs are normalized by subtracting the enhancement response after injection of the capture mAb (leading to &#916;Enh). Sample levels are normalized to the capture level of each mAbs (Norm<sub>Sam</sub>). The enhancement response is then normalized by dividing the delta enhancement response by the normalized sample levels (Norm<sub>&#916;Enh</sub>).

In this approach, the individual chain A or B was expressed in fusion with the Aga2p protein, which enabled its anchoring in the yeast cell wall.

In order to distinguish mutations directly involved in antibody recognition (i.e., in the epitope) from those affecting the expression, folding or general conformation of the antigen, a conformational control was included in the labeling process (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). This required a second antibody whose binding was compatible with the first antibody under investigation. The most suitable conformational control was then identified for each antibody (Supp. Table S2). Single mutant libraries of ricin chains were generated via SOE-PCR using degenerate primers (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Due to the substantial size of each ricin chain and to facilitate NGS procedures, their sequences were divided into five sub-libraries for each chain. Upon induction, each set of five yeast libraries was simultaneously labeled with the studied antibody and the appropriate conformational control antibody. Subsequently, a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) procedure was used to sort the mutants of ricin that cause a loss of recognition by the antibody under study (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The respective mutations were identified through NGS (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) and corresponding positions defined as part of the functional epitope, as previously described for other antigens.<sup><xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> Finally, the positions identified in this process can be colored on the crystallographic structure of ricin, providing a spatial representation of the epitope (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).

This direct comparison allowed us to assess potential method-dependent differences, which may arise from differences in ligand density, injection times, buffer composition, and signal detection sensitivity. Notably, the presence or absence of galactose can influence the binding of certain antibodies targeting the B chain of ricin, as demonstrated by Orsini.<sup><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> This may also contribute to discrepancies between SPR and BLI measurements, as SPR includes galactose in the running buffer, whereas BLI does not.</p><p>Our results indicated that, under our experimental conditions, SPR yields more accurate dissociation constant measurements than BLI. This is largely attributed to SPR&#8217;s higher sensitivity and its microfluidic flow system, which facilitates the efficient removal of dissociated analytes and minimizes rebinding artifacts. In contrast, BLI&#8217;s use of static wells increases the likelihood of rebinding events, particularly when measuring high-affinity interactions. Although previous studies have demonstrated that BLI performance can be improved by lowering surface ligand densities,<sup><xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> we observed that reduced surface loading led to lower signal-to-noise ratios, which introduced variability and compromised the reliability of high-affinity measurements, despite some improvement in resolution. While BLI remains well suited for high-throughput screening and for distinguishing between low- and high-affinity interactions, its lower sensitivity, rebinding, and evaporation effects limit its utility for accurately resolving the highest-affinity antibodies.<sup><xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> SPR, with lower surface functionalization, minimizes artifacts and provides more precise kinetic measurements, essential for detecting subtle differences.</p><p>Besides affinity, the epitope is arguably the key to understanding the diverse functional characteristics of antibodies. As antibodies can interact with their antigen in various ways, each epitope has a defining role in the functional properties of mAbs, such as specificity or efficacy when used as therapeutic. Understanding these interactions is crucial for designing effective mAb-based therapies and diagnostics. Moreover, unlike other properties such as affinity or pharmacokinetics, which can be modified by engineering, the epitope represents an intrinsic property that is inherent to the antibody itself. Probably due to the often-limited throughput of the various techniques used, detailed epitope mapping is rarely performed early in the drug discovery process. For technical and cost reasons, it is often considered more straightforward to screen the diverse functional properties of antibodies individually using high-throughput techniques than to define the epitopes themselves. Various antibody properties, such as antigen affinity, specificity, selectivity, and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> neutralization ability, can be efficiently screened in high-throughput assays.

Additionally, these techniques facilitate the acquisition of valuable information on paratopes, which are of paramount importance for guiding molecular engineering.

Although commercial software solutions are available for visualizing epitope bins using network plots or heatmaps, these tools are typically tied to specific SPR instruments or proprietary analysis workflows.<sup><xref rid="cit0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> In contrast, our analysis pipeline is fully independent and relies exclusively on openly available tools. The accompanying R scripts are freely accessible, modifiable, and can be readily integrated into existing protocols or adapted to fit individual experimental workflows. Second, this methodology was applied to an extensive dataset of mAbs, resulting in a comprehensive characterization of the affinity and specificity of ricin-specific antibodies, together with their compatibility and complementarities.</p><p>Our results demonstrate strong agreement between epitope bins identified using the SPR binning approach and the exact binding epitopes determined by the more precise DMS method. To our knowledge, this study represents a significant benchmark, as it is the first to comprehensively characterize and directly compare epitope binning and high-resolution epitope mapping across a panel of mAbs using these two orthogonal approaches. This indicates that epitope clusters can be confidently determined at higher throughput using the established SPR approach. Including antibodies with known binding epitopes from the literature can further enhance the significance of SPR binning results. These well-defined antibodies serve as &#8220;anchor bins,&#8221; allowing bin assignments to be mapped onto the antigen surface and facilitating the spatial contextualization of newly characterized mAbs. In contrast, the combined DMS and YSD mutation screening approach identified the key amino acids involved in antibody recognition for 13 antibodies in the panel.</p><p>As this approach allows the identification of amino acids that contribute to the binding affinity between antigen and antibody, we have previously proposed the term &#8216;functional epitope&#8217; to designate them.<sup><xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Our epitope mapping approach enables the identification of a wide range of distinct, yet partially overlapping, epitopes, offering comprehensive coverage. This technique enhances our understanding of the epitopes targeted by anti-ricin antibodies, revealing critical insights into their mechanisms of action and specificity. Notably, many of the antibodies tested share epitope similarities with those previously documented, allowing us to hypothesize their mode of action and infer their therapeutic potential. Indeed, previous studies have characterized various anti-ricin VHH and IgG antibodies using X-ray crystallography and HDX-MS, aiming to correlate their epitopes and binding affinities with their neutralizing or protective efficacy.<sup><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="cit0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="cit0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> While several studies demonstrate that antibodies targeting specific epitopes can effectively neutralize the toxin, others, despite high affinity, fail to produce similar outcomes.<sup><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Additionally, certain neutralizing antibodies show efficacy <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, but do not provide protection <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, particularly in severe intoxication models where treatment is delayed for several hours post-exposure.<sup><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>This is particularly true of the RicE8 and RicE4 antibodies, which target the same epitope as SylH3 and JB4, both highly neutralizing antibodies (Supp. Fig. S7).<sup><xref rid="cit0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> Notably, SylH3&#160;has demonstrated protective efficacy in prophylactic models.<sup><xref rid="cit0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="cit0073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup> These antibodies significantly reduce ricin binding to host cells, although they do not directly interact with the carbohydrate binding sites of RTB. Despite its very high affinity and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> neutralizing capacity, RicE8 shows reduced post-exposure protective efficacy.<sup><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Given the ability of SylH3 to protect in a prophylactic model, this suggests that the mechanism of action of these antibodies, which blocks ricin&#8217;s entry into cells, is highly effective before exposure, but shows diminished efficacy after exposure.</p><p>It is worth noting that two of the antibodies under investigation, RicE5 and R18, have been observed to target an original epitope that appears to diverge significantly from those previously described in the literature. The newly identified epitope is located on the opposite side of the active site, with helix D and the loop b-c at its center (Supp. Fig. S8, Supp. Fig. S9). This loop has previously been identified as part of the epitope for neutralizing antibodies that offered only weak <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> protection<sup><xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and as an immunodominant B-cell epitope in patients treated with RTA immunotoxin for Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma.<sup><xref rid="cit0074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup> While helix D is included in the epitopes of numerous VHH antibodies described in the literature,<sup><xref rid="cit0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup> it is seldom the central element. Other antibodies that interact primarily with the &#945;D-helix have demonstrated limited or no neutralizing activity, which may be related to their moderate binding affinity for ricin.</p><p>In contrast, recent studies have demonstrated that RicE5 is a highly neutralizing and protective antibody when administered post-exposure to ricin, including at late treatment times.<sup><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Our data suggest that targeting this new epitope is a promising avenue for the generation of new antibodies with potential therapeutic applications, and that R18 may also possess this type of property, which will be the subject of future research. The precise mechanism of action of the antibodies targeting this particular epitope remains to be determined. One hypothesis is that targeting very distinct secondary structures with high affinity could induce conformational stabilization of the ricin A chain, thereby preventing the unfolding required for translocation into the cytoplasm, as previously proposed.<sup><xref rid="cit0076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup> This hypothesis will have to be verified in the future through mechanistic studies.</p><p>The majority of antibodies in this set demonstrate comparable efficacy in detecting both ricin D and E isolectins. However, there are notable exceptions, with some interesting mAbs such as RB34 and RB37, exhibiting a distinct preference for ricin D and RicE7 exhibiting a distinct preference for ricin E. These mAbs may offer a potential avenue for differentiating between the two isoforms, especially for forensics applications. However, to maximize therapeutic efficacy and provide optimal <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> protection, anti-ricin antibody candidates should preferably display cross-reactivity, enabling the efficient neutralization of both isoforms that coexist in the majority of the cultivars of <italic toggle="yes">Ricinus communis</italic>.<sup><xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> In this regard, epitope mapping offers invaluable insight by accurately identifying the specific substitutions responsible for the observed difference in affinity. This is exemplified by the case of RB34 and RB37, whose epitope partially overlaps the 2&#945; and 2&#947; subdomains, which contain a significant number of mutations that differentiate the two isoforms (<xref rid="f0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and Supp. Fig. S10). These observations are also fully consistent with the previously observed reduced ability of these antibodies to neutralize ricin in <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> cell-based assays and their limited ability to protect mice in <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> models that include both ricin isoforms.<sup><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Other anti-B-chain antibodies, however, show interesting cross-reactivity, in particular RicE4 and RicE8, which appears consistent with the location of their epitope in the 1&#946; domain, at a distance from substitutions between isoforms.</p><p>In addition, cross-reactivity to the closely related agglutinin, which is approx. 90% identical to ricin,<sup><xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> was assessed. It is plausible that agglutinin could act as a &#8216;sink&#8217; for anti-ricin antibodies with potential neutralizing capabilities if crude ricin preparations containing both ricin and agglutinin were used in a bioterrorist attack. Assessing binding to ricin agglutinin can also be important for forensic and detection applications, as agglutinin is often co-extracted with ricin from castor beans. Distinguishing between the two can be helpful to enhance the specificity of detection methods and prevents false positives in toxin identification. The high sequence identity between ricin and agglutinin makes their differentiation challenging. mAbs with defined epitopes can selectively target either toxin, a feature particularly useful for forensic applications. For instance, VHH-Fc V2G10 and V2A11, along with RicE7, 43RCA-G1, and to a lesser extent VHH-Fc E5, exhibit the ability to recognize and bind both agglutinin and ricin. This cross-reactivity distinguishes them from other antibodies, which are specific to ricin.</p><p>The presented data suggest that avidity effects can play a significant role in a YSD setup with bivalent antibodies, as evidenced by the discrepancy between the number of amino acids identified in the functional epitopes of Fab and IgG molecules. To mitigate avidity effects, we utilized antibodies in a monomeric Fab format whenever feasible. By facilitating the selection of lower-affinity clones during FACS, this strategy helps identify core epitope/paratope residues while also detecting neighboring amino acids that, though non-essential, may influence binding. However, reformatting antibodies into Fabs demands significant time and resources for recombinant expression and cloning, which can limit screening throughput. In contrast, IgGs derived from hybridomas can be screened directly without modification, offering higher throughput but potentially identifying fewer epitope residues due to avidity effects.</p><p>In conclusion, this work establishes a framework for the selection of anti-ricin antibodies that target specific epitopes, with a particular focus on those that are highly neutralizing and protective, and exhibit ricin D/E cross-reactivity. By conducting competitive selections with well-characterized molecules and performing detailed epitope mapping, it is possible to streamline the identification of promising candidates. Given the low-throughput nature of animal experiments, it is preferable to reserve these for later stages of development. Importantly, our integrated use of DMS and epitope binning now provides a powerful and coherent framework to identify antibodies with distinct, non-overlapping epitopes. This is essential for the rational design of therapeutic cocktails, as combining antibodies that target multiple distinct neutralizing epitopes with high affinity can potentially lead to synergistic neutralization and improved therapeutic efficacy. Such an approach also reduces the risk of escape mutants that could limit treatment efficacy. Future work will focus on evaluating these rationally designed antibody cocktails <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> to confirm their improved protective potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM3513" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="KMAB_A_2544922_SM3513.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="COI-statement" disp-level="1" id="s0005"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" disp-level="1" id="s0006"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>Data files and R scripts for the analysis of binding kinetics and epitope binning are publicly available here: <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/RKI-ZBS/SPR_kinetics_binning" ext-link-type="uri">.https://github.com/RKI-ZBS/SPR_kinetics_binning</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" disp-level="1" id="s0007"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>Supplemental data for this article can be accessed online at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19420862.2025.2544922" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1080/19420862.2025.2544922</ext-link></p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Worbs</surname><given-names>S</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Kohler</surname><given-names>K</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Pauly</surname><given-names>D</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Avondet</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Schaer</surname><given-names>M</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Dorner</surname><given-names>MB</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Dorner</surname><given-names>BG.</given-names></string-name></person-group><article-title>Ricinus communis intoxications in human and veterinary medicine-a summary of real cases</article-title>. <source>Toxins (Basel)</source>. <year>2011</year>;<volume>3</volume>(<issue>10</issue>):<fpage>1332</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>22</lpage>. doi: <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3390/toxins3101332</pub-id>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22069699</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC3210461</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="cit0002"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Flade</surname><given-names>F</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>The June 2018 Cologne ricin plot: a new threshold in jihadi bio terror</article-title>. <source>CTC Sentinel</source>. <year>2018</year>;<volume>11</volume>:<fpage>1</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>4</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="cit0003"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Orsini Delgado</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Avril</surname><given-names>A</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Prigent</surname><given-names>J</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Dano</surname><given-names>J</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Rouaix</surname><given-names>A</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Worbs</surname><given-names>S</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Dorner</surname><given-names>BG</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Rougeaux</surname><given-names>C</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Becher</surname><given-names>F</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Fenaille</surname><given-names>F</given-names></string-name>, et al</person-group>. <article-title>Ricin antibodies&#8217;
