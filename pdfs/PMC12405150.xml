This study identifies a significant upregulation of DDX60 in cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions. Elevated DDX60 levels enhance mitochondrial function and attenuate cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro, whereas its knockdown induces the opposite effects. In vivo, cardiomyocyte-specific DDX60 knockout markedly exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, accelerating post-MI cardiac remodeling and functional decline. Furthermore, we found that Arl2 knockdown partially negates the protective effects of DDX60 overexpression on ATP production and apoptosis. Conversely, adeno-associated virus-9 (AAV9)-mediated Arl2 overexpression partially restores cardiac function, reduces infarct size, and rescues mitochondrial integrity in DDX60 CKO mice post-MI. Mechanistically, DDX60 forms a translational complex with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 1 (EIF4G1) that enhances Arl2 mRNA translation, a process essential for mitochondrial homeostasis. Collectively, these findings establish DDX60 as a key regulator of cardioprotection post-MI by enhancing Arl2 translation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for ischemic heart disease.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00018-025-05839-x.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cardiomyocyte apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Mitochondrial function</kwd><kwd>Myocardial infarction</kwd><kwd>DDX60</kwd><kwd>Arl2</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014718</institution-id><institution>Innovative Research Group Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82000332</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, characterized by acute coronary artery occlusion, ischemic cardiomyocyte death, and adverse ventricular remodeling. Whereas reperfusion therapies substantially improve clinical outcomes, residual mortality persists because of irreversible myocardial damage and progressive heart failure (HF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Mitochondrial dysfunction is central to this pathogenesis, which drives cardiomyocyte apoptosis, the predominant form of programmed cell death in ischemic myocardium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, cytochrome c release, and downstream caspase-3 activation trigger a cascade of apoptotic signaling, exacerbating myocardial injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite advances in pharmacological and interventional strategies, targeted interventions aimed at mitochondrial preservation in the infarcted heart remain limited. This drawback necessitates identifying novel molecular regulators of cardiomyocyte survival.</p><p id="Par3">Mitochondria serve as the cellular powerhouses responsible for generating 90% of cardiac adenosine triphosphate (ATP); they regulate calcium homeostasis, redox balance, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Emerging evidence implicates mitochondrial dysfunction as a central mechanism underlying ischemia/reperfusion injury, characterized by impaired oxidative phosphorylation, excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mPTP-driven apoptotic cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Notably, the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor-like 2 (Arl2) has emerged as a key regulator of mitochondrial function. This evolutionarily conserved protein localizes to the mitochondrial matrix, where it facilitates oxidative phosphorylation complex assembly and ATP synthase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Preclinical studies demonstrate that Arl2 deficiency exacerbates mitochondrial fragmentation in obesity-induced cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], whereas its downregulation aggravates pyroptosis in atrial fibrillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses have implicated Arl2 as a pivotal mediator in dilated cardiomyopathy pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Collectively, Arl2 holds promise in preserving mitochondrial integrity and cardiac function under pathological stress, highlighting its potential in cardiovascular disease management.</p><p id="Par4">The D-E-X-H/D-box helicase family comprises ATP-dependent RNA helicases that regulate fundamental processes in RNA metabolism and protein translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Beyond their canonical roles in antiviral defense and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], these enzymes have been increasingly implicated in cardiovascular pathophysiology. For instance, DHX9 exacerbates atherosclerosis progression by promoting pro-inflammatory macrophage activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], whereas DDX5 regulates phenotypic switching in vascular smooth muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Notably, multiple D-E-X-H/D-box proteins directly regulate mitochondrial processes. For instance, the ABO6-encoded D-E-X-H/D-box RNA helicase regulates mitochondrial complex I gene splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], whereas DDX28 orchestrates mitoribosome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Hence, D-E-X-H/D-box helicases play pivotal roles in cardiovascular pathogenesis and mitochondrial homeostasis. Nonetheless, their mechanistic involvement in myocardial infarction and the regulation of mitochondrial function remains unexplored. This study focuses on DDX60, a D-E-X-H/D-box RNA helicase previously associated with innate immunity through retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathway activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Intriguingly, a marked upregulation of DDX60 was observed in hypoxia-exposed cardiomyocytes, a novel finding in cardiac pathophysiology. Though DDX60&#8217;s role in mitochondrial regulation remains unexplored, its structural homology to other mitochondrial helicases suggests potential involvement in organelle homeostasis.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, a novel mitochondrial regulatory axis involving DDX60 and Arl2 was identified. Hypoxia-induced DDX60 expression preserves mitochondrial architecture and bioenergetics in cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, DDX60 forms a translational complex with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 1 (EIF4G1) that enhances Arl2 mRNA translation. This axis maintains mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production. Cardiomyocyte-specific DDX60 deletion exacerbates post-MI ventricular remodeling, whereas Arl2 supplementation restores mitochondrial function and improves survival. These findings establish DDX60 as a master regulator of mitochondrial proteostasis, offering novel therapeutic insights into ischemic cardiomyopathy treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par6">Dulbecco&#8217;s modified Eagle medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), phosphate buffered saline (PBS), trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA); anti-Flag affinity gel was puechased form Bimake (USA); BCA assay kit, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution, 2-(4-Amidinophenyl)&#8722;6-indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride (DAPI) solution, Magnetic Agarose Beads, IDA-Ni Magnetic Agarose Beads, and ATP Assay Kit were purchased from Beyotime (China); SYBR RT-PCR Kit and DNA PCR kit were from Takara Bio Inc.

<bold>DDX60 remarkably alleviated cardiomyocyte apoptosis upon hypoxia stimuli</bold>
</p><p id="Par45">To investigate whether DDX60 regulates cardiomyocyte apoptosis under hypoxia, a time-course experiment was conducted using NMCMs exposed to hypoxia for 0, 12, and 24 h. Western blotting indicated a progressive increase in DDX60 expression at 12 h, which was significantly upregulated at 24 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A&#8211;C), suggesting its potential involvement in cardiomyocyte apoptosis regulation. To further confirm its functional role, DDX60 expression was silenced or overexpressed using adenoviral vectors, with successful transduction confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>A&#8211;C). Interestingly, DDX60 overexpression significantly reduced apoptosis after 24 h of hypoxia, as indicated by decreased cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D&#8211;F). In contrast, DDX60 knockdown reversed this effect, highlighting its protective action (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G&#8211;I). Meanwhile, flow cytometry and TUNEL staining further evaluated the effects of DDX60 on cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Ad&#8211;shDDX60&#8211;infected NMCMs demonstrated an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells after hypoxic exposure. However, NMCMs overexpressing DDX60 (Ad-D60 group) demonstrated significantly decreased apoptosis, compared with negative control (Ad-NC) cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>J&#8211;K and Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>D-E).

Accordingly, echocardiographic assessment at 28 days post-MI revealed that DDX60 CKO mice exhibited significantly reduced ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), along with markedly enlarged end-systolic and end-diastolic ventricular dimensions compared to control littermates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A-E). Cardiac fibrosis was quantified in transverse heart sections stained with Masson&#8217;s trichrome, demonstrating a substantial increase in total collagen content in DDX60 CKO mice relative to controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F-G). To further delineate this disparity, collagen deposition was assessed across different cardiac regions, revealing significantly denser collagen accumulation in the infarct zones at both papillary and apical levels in DDX60 CKO hearts compared to DDX60<sup>fl/fl</sup> hearts (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3</xref>A-E). Additionally, Picrosirius red staining under polarized light showed densely packed, thick, and highly organized collagen fibers in the infarcted myocardium of DDX60 CKO hearts at 28 days post-MI, whereas control littermates exhibited relatively sparse and disorganized fibers (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3</xref>F-G).

Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S4</xref>) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5</xref>) were conducted to determine biological processes associated with DDX60. Notably, the identified interacting proteins were predominantly involved in the early stages of protein synthesis, including translational initiation, cytoplasmic translation initiation complex formation, translational regulation, viral translation termination-reinitiation, and internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent viral translational initiation (Table <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Venn diagram analysis of overlapping proteins from both databases identified three candidates: EIF3G, EIF4G1, and STAU1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). Given the pivotal role of EIF4G1 in eukaryotic translation initiation, AlphaFold3 was employed to predict its interaction with DDX60. The predicted interface pTM and ipTM scores were 0.54 and 0.33, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C), suggesting a potential direct interaction. To validate this interaction, IF staining and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were performed.

Western blot analysis validated the proteomic findings, revealing a pronounced reduction in Arl2 protein levels in DDX60-knockdown cardiomyocytes even in the absence of hypoxic insult (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C). Similarly, Arl2 expression was markedly reduced in cardiomyocyte-specific DDX60 knockout heart tissues under baseline conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D).

A growing body of evidence demonstrates its regulatory function in cardiovascular diseases. For instance, DHX9 contributes to atherosclerosis progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], whereas DDX5 regulates vascular remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The present findings elucidate DDX60&#8217;s unique ability to orchestrate mitochondrial protection, a function distinct from its role in RIG-I-mediated antiviral immunity. This functional divergence highlights the contextual specificity of helicases and necessitates investigating understudied helicase members in disease pathogenesis. DDX60 upregulation under hypoxic conditions in cardiomyocytes, coupled with its mitochondrial regulatory function, positions it as a critical stress-responsive mediator in cardiac adaptation to ischemia.</p><p id="Par66">Mitochondria are cellular powerhouses that control ATP generation through oxidative phosphorylation. They orchestrate energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and redox regulation, all of which are fundamental processes underpinning cellular viability and apoptotic control. Aberrations in mitochondrial function have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders ranging from ischemic cardiomyopathy to atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Beyond cardiovascular contexts, environmental toxicants target mitochondrial networks through distinct mechanisms. For example, arsenic exposure drives ferroptosis via ROS accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], microplastics induce pyroptosis through membrane destabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and phthalates activate apoptosis through inflammatory cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These events converge on mitochondrial collapse as a universal pathomechanism. The systematic analysis of DDX60&#8217;s protective role&#8212;spanning transmission electron microscopy, oxygen consumption rate assays, and hierarchical validation through Arl2 overexpression&#8212;suggests a conserved regulatory axis that counters these destructive processes. Arl2 restoration in DDX60-deficient NMCMs reverses bioenergetic defects, confirming the DDX60&#8211;Arl2 axis as a hierarchical pathway. Moreover, it positions this axis as a universal regulator of mitochondrial resilience under stress.</p><p id="Par67">The mechanistic interplay between DDX60 and its molecular partners forms a tightly coordinated axis critical for cardiac recovery after ischemic injury. Through a multi-layered experimental approach&#8212;combining proteomic screening that identified EIF4G1 as a DDX60-binding protein, glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay confirming direct interaction, and RNA immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirming DDX60&#8217;s association with Arl2 mRNA&#8212;a biologically relevant regulatory chain was delineated. This triad of molecular interactions positions DDX60 as a translational enhancer, leveraging EIF4G1&#8217;s canonical role in forming the eIF4F translation initiation complex. Stable Arl2 mRNA levels confirm this post-transcriptional regulation, despite protein depletion in DDX60-deficient cardiomyocytes. This finding elucidates translational control rather than transcriptional regulation as the primary mechanism. Notably, the DDX60-Arl2 axis converges on mitochondrial dynamics and cellular survival, with Arl2&#8217;s established roles in ATP synthase stabilization and cristae morphology maintaining bioenergetic integrity under hypoxia. Hence, DDX60-mediated Arl2 upregulation protects the ischemic myocardium.</p><p id="Par68">Despite these substantial mechanistic insights, certain limitations merit discussion. First, translational regulation has been demonstrated using Arl2 as a target; nonetheless, further studies should use polysome profiling to delineate precise ribosome loading dynamics. Second, the exclusive use of male murine models limits the generalizability of the findings, specifically related to sex-based responses in MI pathogenesis and post-MI remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Third, the translational applicability of these findings necessitates future investigations using human cardiomyocyte models and pharmacological DDX60 activators. Nevertheless, this study has a few strengths. Advances in gene delivery technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and hypoxia-responsive vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] may overcome therapeutic barriers, potentially enabling the targeted activation of DDX60 in ischemic tissues.</p><p id="Par69">In conclusion, this study identifies DDX60 as a central mediator of mitochondrial adaptation to ischemic injury through its novel role in Arl2 translation. By bridging RNA helicase function with mitochondrial proteostasis, these findings advance the understanding of post-MI cardiac recovery and offer a novel therapeutic avenue for modulating mitochondrial resilience. The efficacy of AAV9-mediated Arl2 supplementation in rescuing DDX60-deficient phenotypes further supports the translational potential of this axis. Considering the role of mitochondrial dysfunction across several cardiovascular disorders, the DDX60-Arl2 axis holds promise as a strategy to improve clinical outcomes in ischemic heart disease and beyond.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="18_2025_5839_MOESM1_ESM.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(JPG 611 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="18_2025_5839_MOESM2_ESM.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>ESM 2</label><caption><p>(JPG 934 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="18_2025_5839_MOESM3_ESM.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>ESM 3</label><caption><p>(JPG 1.74 MB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="18_2025_5839_MOESM4_ESM.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>ESM 4</label><caption><p>(JPG 668 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM5" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="18_2025_5839_MOESM5_ESM.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>ESM 5</label><caption><p>(JPG 432 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM6" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="18_2025_5839_MOESM6_ESM.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>ESM 6</label><caption><p>(JPG 465 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM7" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="18_2025_5839_MOESM7_ESM.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>ESM 7</label><caption><p>(JPG 643 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM8" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="18_2025_5839_MOESM8_ESM.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>ESM 8</label><caption><p>(JPG 329 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM9" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="18_2025_5839_MOESM9_ESM.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>ESM 9</label><caption><p>(DOCX 25.6 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM10" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="18_2025_5839_MOESM10_ESM.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>ESM 10</label><caption><p>(DOCX 12.5 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM11" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="18_2025_5839_MOESM11_ESM.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>ESM 11</label><caption><p>(DOCX 105 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Tianyou Yuan, Changzuan Zhou and Yifan Long contributed equally to this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Original data and materials in the present study are available upon reasonable request.</p></notes><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar1"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p id="Par70">This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
