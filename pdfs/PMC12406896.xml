Etrasimod is an oral, once-daily (QD), selective sphingosine 1-phosphate<sub>1,4,5</sub> receptor modulator for the treatment of moderately to severely active UC. We assessed outcomes related to symptomatic relief among patients with moderately to severely active UC in the phase III ELEVATE UC clinical programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In both ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12, adults were randomly assigned (2:1) to etrasimod 2&#8201;mg QD or placebo. Symptomatic remission, symptomatic response, complete symptomatic remission, SF and RB were evaluated at each trial visit. Bowel urgency and abdominal pain were also assessed (weeks 12 and 52).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Significantly more patients receiving etrasimod were in symptomatic remission and symptomatic response at weeks 12 and 52 versus placebo (all p&lt;0.001). Improvements from baseline in RB and SF subscores were significantly greater in those receiving etrasimod versus placebo from weeks 2 (ELEVATE UC 12) and 4 (ELEVATE UC 52). Similarly, a significantly greater number of patients in the etrasimod versus placebo group were in complete symptomatic remission. At weeks 12 and 52, the number of patients achieving clinically meaningful improvements in bowel urgency, bowel urgency remission and abdominal pain remission was significantly greater for etrasimod versus placebo (all p&lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Etrasimod was efficacious in improving symptoms of UC from week 2;

Patients were considered non-responders if they had missed an assessment at the specified analysis visit. P values were reported without adjustment for multiplicity. To analyse the change from baseline in SFS and RBS, a linear mixed-effect model was used and applied to observed data, with no imputation for missing values. To identify potential baseline predictors of symptomatic remission at week 12 or 52, we used logistic regression analyses to understand associations between symptomatic remission and each of the following baseline covariates: age (&lt;/&#8805; median 38 years), sex (female/male), race (Asian/White; Other/White), geographic region (North America/Others; Europe/Others), baseline body mass index (&lt;25/&#8805;30; &#8805;25&#8211;30/&#8805;30&#8201;kg/mg<sup>2</sup>), tobacco use (past/never; current/never), baseline disease activity (MMS 4&#8211;6/7&#8211;9), baseline ES (2/3), duration of UC (&lt;5/&#8805;5 years), extent of disease (left-sided colitis or proctosigmoiditis/pancolitis; proctitis/pancolitis), proctitis (no/yes), bio/JAKi na&#239;ve status (yes/no), baseline high-sensitivity C reactive protein (&lt;5/&#8805;5&#8201;mg/L), baseline faecal calprotectin (&lt;150/&#8805;150&#8201;&#181;g/g), baseline albumin (&#8805;35/&lt;35&#8201;g/L), baseline anaemia (no/yes), baseline oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (no/yes), baseline RBS (1/&#8805;2), baseline SFS (1/&#8805;2) and baseline corticosteroid use (no/yes).

Therefore, among patients with UC, treatment with etrasimod improves symptomatic burden and thus may ameliorate treatment satisfaction and quality of life.</p><p>In both trials, treatment with etrasimod versus placebo led to a significant difference between treatment groups in the percentage of patients achieving symptomatic remission observed at the first on-treatment trial visit at week 2 and week 4 (ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12, respectively). Notably, over half of the patients receiving either treatment in both trials had a baseline SFS of 3, the highest possible for this subscore, indicative of &#8805;5 stools more than normal, and an RBS of &#8805;2 (out of 3), indicative of obvious blood in stool most of the time, which suggests that etrasimod is effective for patients with substantial symptomatic burden. The proportion of patients meeting symptomatic remission increased at week 12 of treatment and was maintained to week 52; importantly, around 75% of patients receiving etrasimod who reached symptomatic remission, or an RBS=0 at week 12, also had an RBS=0 at week 52. The greatest improvements with etrasimod versus placebo were seen in bio/JAKi-na&#239;ve patients, those with previous exposure to only one bio/JAKi and patients without baseline corticosteroid use. This is consistent with results of studies in other advanced treatments showing that advanced treatment experienced patients are often more refractory to treatment compared with those who are advanced treatment na&#239;ve.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16 17</sup></xref> An alternative explanation for this observation is that some treatment-refractory patients may take longer to achieve remission, but more of the original week 12 responders lose response in the bio/JAKi-experienced cohort. For patients receiving etrasimod, it was observed that, although a lesser proportion of patients who are advanced-treatment experienced may reach symptomatic remission, those that do achieve this endpoint can do so as rapidly as those na&#239;ve to advanced treatments. Additionally, significantly more patients with moderately (baseline MMS 4&#8211;6) and severely (baseline MMS 7&#8211;9) active UC achieved symptomatic remission with etrasimod versus placebo at weeks 12 and 52, indicating that etrasimod is efficacious across the disease activity spectrum.</p><p>Consistent with the observation that etrasimod was more efficacious in patients who were bio/JAKi-na&#239;ve, logistic regression analysis identified, among those enrolled in ELEVATE UC 52, being bio/JAKi-na&#239;ve at baseline was a predictor of achieving symptomatic remission at both weeks 12 and 52. These results are consistent with greater clinical and endoscopic efficacy shown in the ELEVATE trials in patients who were bio/JAKi-na&#239;ve versus bio/JAKi-experienced,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> which has also been demonstrated with vedolizumab and adalimumab.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16 17</sup></xref> Additional potential predictors included proctitis versus pancolitis at baseline as a predictor of endpoint achievement at week 52.

We, however, hypothesise that this is reflective of differences in baseline characteristics of trial patients from Europe versus North America versus Others, which include a greater proportion of patients with proctitis (by central read), less with pancolitis (data not shown) and possibly joint effects or other differences in patient baseline characteristics. Furthermore, lower baseline endoscopic activity as well as faecal calprotectin below 150&#8201;&#956;g/g were also potential predictors of symptomatic remission at week 12 in ELEVATE UC 12. The differences observed in the identified variables for each of ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12 are likely related to the variations in measures of baseline disease activity and baseline disease extent, given the observed association between symptomatic remission and measures of both lower disease activity and limited disease extent. This, in turn, is consistent with established knowledge that disease severity/activity at baseline is a predictor of endpoint achievement across numerous advanced therapies in UC, including vedolizumab (as measured by partial Mayo score),<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> infliximab (as measured by C reactive protein concentration)<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> and golimumab (as measured by baseline ES; induction period).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p><p>Bowel urgency is also a key symptom of UC, having a considerable negative impact on both quality of life and the psychosocial functioning of patients.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22 23</sup></xref> In our post-hoc analysis, a significantly greater percentage of patients who received etrasimod versus placebo demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in bowel urgency (&#8805;3-point decrease in bowel urgency NRS score) at weeks 12 and 52, and bowel urgency remission (urgency NRS &#8804;1). More of those who received etrasimod versus placebo also experienced abdominal pain remission (NRS=0) at weeks 12 and 52.</p><p>Taken together, our findings regarding RB and SF as well as bowel urgency and abdominal pain align with the significant efficacy on health-related quality of life measures previously demonstrated with etrasimod at weeks 12 and 52.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> These include the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) remission endpoints and improvements in the bowel symptoms domain score of the IBDQ.</p><p>These analyses are limited by the fact that many were post hoc in nature and not controlled for multiplicity. In addition, limitations in the subgroup analyses include the relatively small sample size and that the study was not powered for efficacy outcomes in subgroup analyses.
