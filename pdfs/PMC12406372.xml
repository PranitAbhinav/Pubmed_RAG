The International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group (IKWG) recommends calculating Ki67 globally across the tumor area, as this method offers high interobserver concordance. These recommendations have been integrated into many international breast cancer guidelines (ASCO, ESMO), yet there is no real-world data on if it improved inter-pathologists and inter-laboratory variability. Here, we present the first real-world data on the variability and impact of Ki67 scores on clinical decision-making in breast cancer when using hotspot scoring and after implementing IKWG global scoring method in clinical practice. We extracted hotspot and global scoring results from 4313 breast cancer patients from routine diagnostics, categorizing the scores into three clinical risk groups over a one-year period across two large breast centers in Stockholm, Sweden. Variability between pathologists was not clinically significant. The global scoring method improved inter-laboratory consistency but also led to a notable increase in cases classified as intermediate at both centers This has been captured in the 2022 Swedish clinical breast cancer guidelines recommending molecular profiling test for patients with Grade II, global Ki67 intermediate score, T1c / T2 breast cancer. To conclude, our findings demonstrate acceptable consistency in Ki67 scores among individual pathologists across both scoring methods, however high inter-laboratory variability was observed with hot spot scoring. Global Ki67 scoring demonstrated low inter-laboratory variability in real world breast cancer care, thereby increasing the reliability of Ki67 assessment in clinical decision-making.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13058-025-02114-6.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Ki67</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Global scoring</kwd><kwd>Interobserver variability</kwd><kwd>IKWG</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Karolinska Institute</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by Karolinska Institute.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">Ki67 is a widely accessible immunohistochemical marker for measuring proliferation in various malignancies, based on the premise that tumors with higher proliferation rates are more aggressive. In breast cancer, Ki67 has been extensively studied for its prognostic and promising predictive value, and has been shown to correlate strongly with Prosigna test scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. According to the ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline for early breast cancer, Ki67 is recommended in the pretreatment pathological evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Traditionally, Ki67 staining has been scored according to the &#8220;hotspot&#8221; approach that focuses on the most proliferative region in invasive breast cancer. However, there are uncertainties regarding whether tumor behavior is accurately represented by this small area, potentially leading to overestimating of aggressiveness, although some researchers claimed the opposite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other limitations of the hotspot scoring method include intra- and inter-observer variability due to intra-tumoral heterogeneity and difficulty in identifying precisely the &#8220;hotspot&#8221; region due to lack of well-defined criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">The International Ki67 Working Group (IKWG) has put great effort to standardize and improve Ki67 assessment aiming to achieve analytical validity and enhance its clinical utility. They reached high interobserver concordance using global scoring method in several rounds of international round-robin setting (multiple pathologists independently evaluating the same set of slides) in a cohort of 30 primary estrogen receptor positive breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. IKWG has suggested that the results that are below 5% (Ki67 low) or above 30% (Ki67 high) can be used in clinical setting to determine the patient group that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">While global scoring can be time-consuming in comparison to hotspot scoring, it offers a better representation of tumor heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although AI-based digital pathology tools that facilitate global scoring are available (e.g. Visiopharm, Mindpeak, Aiforia), their adoption remains limited due to varying levels of accessibility worldwide, mainly driven by cost, validation requirements, and regulatory barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In Sweden, Ki67 is routinely included in breast cancer panels for pathological assessment and is used to divide ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors in clinical risk categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. According to the recommendation from the Quality and Standardization Committee of the Swedish Association for Pathology (KVAST), the &#8220;weighted global score&#8221; method by the IKWG was implemented on March 1, 2022, for both biopsy and resection specimens in cases of invasive breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Impact of Ki67 on clinical decision-making recommendation</title><p id="Par29">In clinical practice, Ki67 is used as categorical variable: low, intermediate and high. We observed that a greater proportion of cases (52.4% and 41.9%) fell in the high category using the hotspot method. The global method resulted in a significant increase in cases classified as intermediate, rising from 25,1% to 58,5% in SH and from 20,5% to 57,5% in Solna. Using the hotspot method, the distribution of cases across Ki67 categories varied between the clinics (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). On the contrary, a more similar distribution (but statistically significant difference (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;.001)) was seen between SH and Solna with the global method, almost 60% of cases in both clinics fell into the intermediate category (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The same distribution of Ki67 groups was observed when biopsy and resection specimens evaluated separately (Supplementary <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>&#160;A-B). The higher rate of Ki67 intermediate category by the global method has been interpreted in the 2022 Swedish clinical decision tree recommending gene expression profiling for patients with Grade II, Ki67 intermediate, T1c / T2 breast cancer (Supplementary <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par31">Ki67 is a simple and valuable tool in breast cancer management, whereas its interpretation can vary due to differences in scoring methods, such as hotspot and global scoring. Standardization efforts by IKWG aimed to improve the scoring consistency and to enhance clinical utility of Ki67 in routine practice resulting in global scoring is recommended by both ASCO and ESMO international breast cancer guidelines.</p><p id="Par32">Therefore, we investigated the variability of Ki67 scores using two different scoring methods in routine practice across two clinics and explored how the transition from hotspot to global scoring has impacted clinical decision-making guidelines. To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the recommendations of IKWG and the variability of different scoring methods in real-world data, however there are previous studies focusing on the analytical validity of Ki67 in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Before starting this study, we hypothesized that variability between pathologists would be higher with the hotspot scoring due to subjective nature of the method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Still, we found acceptable consistency between individual pathologists regardless of the scoring method.</p><p id="Par34">Our findings suggest that variability between individual pathologists is not as pronounced as expected, even in resection specimens that encompass a larger area than biopsies. Standardization of pre-analytical variables, even though cases were stained at two laboratories and evaluated by different pathologists working at those centers, may have contributed to this result. Furthermore, our findings suggest that pathologists at the same department have the same scoring tendencies.</p><p id="Par35">In the current study, while the pathologists&#8217; scores are consistent with those of their colleagues with both scoring methods, a significant variability between laboratories exists. This finding aligns with the results from our earlier study, which observed inter- and intra-laboratory variability in pathological parameters, including Ki67, within a national cohort in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. After transitioning to global scoring, the distribution of Ki67 categories shifted significantly, with an increase in the number of cases categorized as intermediate, resulting in a more similar distribution between the centers. For this reason, global scoring is recommended for better alignment across centers.</p><p id="Par36">While our study highlights notable differences in Ki67 risk categories depending on the method used, not all studies have reported such discrepancies. For instance, in the study of Jang et al., no significant differences were observed in the categorization of 493 tumors (Ki67 low vs. high) when comparing hotspot and global scoring methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, their study is not directly comparable with this current study due to differences in the definition of global scoring, the cut-off values applied, and patient population involved.</p><p id="Par37">From a biological perspective, global scoring provides a more accurate reflection of the overall tumor proliferation status. Zilenaite-Petrulaitiene et al. observed lower intratumoral heterogeneity in cases at both ends of the Ki67 proliferation index scale when using a study-specific cut-off value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, establishing a universal cut-off for dichotomization is challenging for a continuous marker as Ki67, because it may not apply consistently across pathology departments due to pre-analytic and analytic variability. Therefore, defining an intermediate category with the proposed cut-off values from the IKWG can be valuable, as it may identify a subgroup with higher intratumoral heterogeneity and uncertain behavior, highlighting the need for additional information about tumor biology, potentially supported by multigene tests or AI-based analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Half of the studied breast cancers fall into the intermediate grade category that provides limited clinical value for guiding patient management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, the expansion of the intermediate Ki67 group may present a new challenge: an increased number of cases with uncertain treatment decisions, which may lead to greater reliance on molecular testing to guide adjuvant therapy. This raises concerns about fair access to health care, as patients who cannot get these tests may have less treatment options. On the other hand, high variability in Ki67 scoring between pathology labs can also cause inequality in cancer care. To ease these concerns, other established clinicopathologic factors (e.g.: age, tumor size, grade, lymph node status, hormone receptor status) considered together with Ki67 may aid the decision-making.</p><p id="Par39">Ki67 scores are clinically relevant particularly for early-stage luminal/HER2-negative breast cancer in post-menopausal patients, whereas treatment choices for triple-negative and HER2-positive cancers are mostly independent of Ki67 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In the latest St. Gallen Conference, Ki67 and change of Ki67 by treatment were mentioned as prognostic biomarkers with limited value in influencing adjuvant chemotherapy decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Ki67 is also a companion diagnostic for the FDA-approved abemaciclib therapy in the USA, specifically for patients with a Ki67 score of &#8805;&#8201;20% measured by a specific FDA-approved test. However, there are criticisms regarding the predictive value of this cut-off in real-world scenarios, particularly concerning the sparse evidence on reproducibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In Stockholm, the clinical guidelines changed in 2022 and global Ki67 has been incorporated together with grade, tumor size, ER/PR/HER2 status in the decision-making on molecular profiling test and or on adjuvant chemotherapy. Molecular profiling test is recommended for patients with T1c/T2, grade 2, Ki67 intermediate and ER positive/Her2 negative breast cancer. For all the other ER positive/Her2 negative breast cancer patients, the above-mentioned clinicopathologic factors with global Ki67 score shall be used to decide on recommending adjuvant chemotherapy. This context highlights the clinical relevance of refining and standardizing Ki67 scoring methods.</p><p id="Par40">As a limitation of our study, we did not account for the clinical- and molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Furthermore, our study was not prospectively designed to demonstrate clinical utility. However, only randomized clinical trials can provide evidence on clinical utility and the international guidelines already recommend assessing Ki67 in clinical practice. Therefore, we believe that our study offers valuable real-world data about the analytical validity of implementing global Ki67 scoring in clinical routine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par41">In conclusion, we demonstrated no significant variability of Ki67 scores between individual pathologists, while global scoring has resulted in a similar distribution in Ki67 risk categories. On the other hand, hot spot scoring showed high inter-laboratory variability. This highlights the importance of implementing the IKWG global Ki67 scoring guidelines to enhance the risk assessment of breast cancer patients in clinical decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
