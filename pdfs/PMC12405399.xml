For the purpose of diagnosis and treatment, a classification into localised odontogenic abscesses and abscesses with a tendency to spread should be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, the latter can lead to life-threatening localised (sinusitis, orbital cellulitis, mediastinitis) or systemic complications (sepsis) which are associated with high mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The triggering bacterial spectrum of odontogenic abscesses stems from the oral microbiome. Polymicrobial infections that are dominated by anaerobic microorganisms are therefore most typical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Treatment of abscesses with a tendency to spread involves extraoral surgical drainage as well as intravenous antibiotics. In accordance with the current guidelines a microbiological swab should be taken during this procedure, which is then subjected to a conventional microbiological examination using microscopy and culture diagnostics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Unfortunately, conventional microbiological analysis take several days to provide results, thus having seldomly real impact on clinical antibiotic therapy in odontogenic infections. Moreover, in view of the triggering bacterial spectrum, it is not surprising that in many cases no microbial evidence can be provided in everyday clinical practice, or only commensal bacteria can be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">The underlying cause is the cultivation of anaerobic microorganisms, which is associated with a number of pre-analytical and analytical errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">In result, calculated antibiotic therapy is predominantly used for odontogenic abscesses.

In addition, the effects of different antibiotic therapies and the detection of antibiotic resistance on treatment outcomes was investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par14">In the period from January 2022 until April 2023 deep wound swabs were collected from 51 patients undergoing treatment for an odontogenic abscess in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Plastic Surgery at the University Hospital Bonn. All patients received two swabs, from which one was analysed using NGS and the other using conventional microbiological analysis.</p><p id="Par15">The study included patients suffering from an abscess originating from the mandibular teeth with a tendency to spread beyond their primary space of infection. All patients therefore underwent extraoral abscess incision via a submandibular approach. After sharp dissection down to the platysma, a blunt dissection down to the mandible was carried out. This was followed by subperiosteal preparation and collection of the swab, insertion of at least one drain and securing with sutures. In accordance with the current German guidelines, all patients received intravenous antibiotic therapy due to the diagnosis of compartment-abscess with a tendency to spread. In most cases, the first intravenous antibiotic was administered intraoperatively immediately after the swab collection. Oral antibiotic therapy was taken by approximately one third of the patients before hospitalisation. As part of the inpatient stay, standard antibiotic therapy with 3&#8201;g IV ampicillin/sulbactam tid was administered. In patients with penicillin allergy, the regimen was changed to 600&#8201;mg IV clindamycin tid, while 4/0.5g IV piperacillin/tazobactamen tid was used in patient with septic shock or septicaemia. Antibiotic therapy was continued until clinical symptoms had completely subsided.</p><p id="Par16">The sequencable wound swabs were sent to Zymo-Research Europe GmbH, based in Freiburg, Germany (M&#252;lhauser Str. 9, 79110 Freiburg im Breisgau) for gene-based microbiological analysis after sampling. Swabs for the conventional culture-based microbiological analysis remained at the University Hospital Bonn.</p><p id="Par17">Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. This study conducted to the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki from 1964 and was approved by the responsible ethics committee of the University of Bonn (reference 447/21).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par18">Using a curated reference database, the genetic material previously identified in the 16&#8201;s RNA analysis was assigned to organism profiles in a bioinformatic analysis (PrecisionBIOME&#8482; project). The samples were analysed in several steps, which are explained in the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par19"><italic toggle="yes">Sample collection</italic>: The manufacturer Zymo-Research Europe GmbH (M&#252;lhauser Str. 9, 79110 Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany) provides a sterile sampling kit containing a nucleic acid-stabilising solution called DNA/RNA ShieldTM. This solution can stabilise the microbial DNA present in the sample for up to 30 days at room temperature. After sampling, the swabs were dispatched for analysis.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20"><italic toggle="yes">DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing</italic>: In a first step, the microbial DNA is extracted from the sample. The ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit is used for this according to the manufacturer's instructions (Zymo-Research Europe GmbH). The extracted DNA is then prepared for NGS analysis. This step includes library preparation using the Quick-16STM NGS Library Prep Kit (Zymo-Research Europe GmbH) as well as sequencing of barcoded amplicons using the MiSeq sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). A separate kit was used to determine the absolute abundance of microorganisms (Femto Bacterial and Fungal DNA Quantification Kits; Zymo-Research Europe GmbH).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par21"><italic toggle="yes">Bioinformatic analysis and taxonomic assignment</italic>: Bioinformatic analysis was performed using PrecisionBIOMETM bioinformatics pipeline. Uclust was used to carry out the taxonomic classifications. This was done using PrecisionBIOMETM's own database. Phylotypes were computed as percentage proportions based on the total number of sequences in each sample. Absolute microbial quantification was performed using a real-time PCR approach. Here, primers targeting the V1-V3 and ITS regions were used for the quantification of bacteria and fungi, respectively.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par22">The identification of antibiotic resistance genes was carried out using a proprietary sequencing method (Zymo-Research Europe GmbH). This involved an amplicon-based sequencing approach in which PCR primers were used to analyse the contained genetic material for at least eighty resistance genes.</p><p id="Par23">In summary, this enables the taxonomic determination of all microorganisms and the identification of the antibiotic resistance genes present in the sample. Assignment of the genetic material is thereby possible down to the species level; for reasons of clarity, the genus level was used for the comparative analysis.</p><p id="Par24">Conventional microbiological diagnostics and taxonomic determination were performed by using culture and microscopy diagnostic. The results of the conventional smears represent real world data from our clinic. Conventional analysis usually begins with culture on casein soya peptone blood agar, MacConkey agar and Schaedler-KV agar. For tests on fungi, Candiselect and Sabouraud agar is also used. An enrichment bouillon (brain&#8211;heart infusion and thioglycollate bouillon) is usually also prepared.</p><p id="Par25">The aerobic agar media are analysed after 24 and 48 (or 72 in the case of filamentous fungi) hours, the anaerobic cultures after 72 h. The enrichment bouillons are checked daily for turbidity and incubated for 14 days; if there are signs of growth, they are examined under the microscope and seeded onto suitable culture media.</p><p id="Par26">The identification of cultivated microorganisms is supported by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS, Biomerieux).</p><p id="Par27">Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to the guidelines of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) using Vitek2 (Biomerieux) for aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria, microbouillon dilution (Bruker) for strictly anaerobic bacteria and, in individual cases, by gradient diffusion test (E-test) or agar diffusion test. The selection of antibiotics and interpretation of resistance was based on EUCAST recommendations relevant to oral and maxillofacial infections. Due to space limitations and the standardization provided by EUCAST, detailed antibiotic types and concentrations are not listed individually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The results of both analysis methods were therefore available for comparison. As 4 conventional samples were lost during the transport process, these were excluded from the comparative analysis. To enable better categorisation of the cohort and assessment of the treatment results, data from our clinical systems was analysed. Data such as the length of stay (LOS), antibiotic therapy used in hospital and abscess classification were collected. Patient data was handled according to the data protection law of germany regarding critical health care data (DSGVO).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par29">After completing the data collection, statistical analysis was performed using R version 4.3.1 (R Core Team, 2021, Vienna, Austria).</p><p id="Par30">In the first part of the analysis, the conventional and the NGS swab were compared. To investigate the difference in cell count between patients for whom bacteria were detected in the conventional swab and patients for whom no bacteria were detected in the conventional swab, a Wilcoxon-Mann&#8211;Whitney test was applied. Comparisons of the detected genera (overall, anaerob, and aerob) between the conventional and the NGS swabs were performed based on the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In addition, the two types of swabs were compared in terms of whether any bacteria, fungi and antibiotic resistances were detected using McNemar tests.</p><p id="Par31">The second part of the analysis focused on LOS and investigated whether it is affected by certain patient characteristics, namely, previous antibiotic treatment (yes or no), type of antibiotic treatment in hospital (ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin or piperacillin/tazobactamen), whether at least one resistance was detected in the conventional swab (yes or no), and whether at least one resistance was detected in the NGS swab (yes or no). To this end, a time-to-event model can be applied, where the event of interest is discharge from hospital and time is measured in days. Here, univariable semiparametric logistic discrete hazard models were applied, which are common tools for the analysis of discrete time-to-event data. In these models, the so-called discrete hazard function<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="d33e345">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In particular, a logistic regression model, where the effect of days since admission was modelled in a flexible way using a smooth function and the effects of the patient characterises (previous antibiotic treatment, type of antibiotic treatment in hospital, detection of at least one resistance in the conventional swab, and detection of at least one resistance in the NGS swab, respectively) were included as binary variables, was fitted to the data.

The treatment of odontogenic abscesses is therefore an essential part of the everyday clinical practice of oral and maxillofacial plastic surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Life-threatening complications such as necrotising fasciitis, mediastinitis or sepsis, which are associated with high mortality rates of 10&#8211;40%, further emphasise the clinical relevance of this infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">In the treatment of abscesses with a tendency to spread, surgical therapy is the main treatment according to the maxim &#8222;ubi pus, ibis evacua &#8220;. Antibiotic treatment still has a major role, since further spread and septicemia may be prevented by supplementary antibiotic therapy with a fitting calculated or, even better, targeted antibiotic. Changing antibiotics from a broader towards a targeted spectrum reduces the development of resistances and improves outcome by overcoming preexisting resistances.</p><p id="Par43">Thus, only the combination of surgical drainage with targeted antibiotic therapy leads to adequate germ reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While there is no question about the correct way of surgical drainage, changing calculated to targeted antibiotic therapy is only rarely performed. This is due to the fact, that conventional microbiological diagnostics takes several days to provide results, while having particular problems with the identification of anaerobic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">This situation is evident in other disciplines as well. Bioinformatic analysis methods such as &#8216;Maldi TOV&#8217; have become established in everyday clinical practice in the diagnosis of septicemia. Due to the high accuracy and speed of this procedure, treatment outcomes can be improved through early pathogen identification and targeted antibiotic therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">Bioinformatic analysis based on the genetic material identified by NGS offers possibilities comparable to &#8222;Maldi TOV&#8220;. Therefore, this study aimed to compare NGS with the current conventional standard microbiological diagnostics of odontogenic abscesses. Furthermore, we wanted to examine how the used antibiotic therapy and the resistance behavior of germs affects the outcome of patients with odontogenic infections.</p><p id="Par46">While NGS offers clear advantages in sensitivity and comprehensiveness, cost remains a limiting factor for routine clinical implementation. Conventional microbiological analysis is significantly less expensive, whereas NGS currently involves higher per-sample costs due to sequencing reagents, bioinformatic processing, and outsourced analysis. However, costs are steadily decreasing as the technology matures, and the potential for improved patient outcomes and reduced LOS may offset higher diagnostic expenditures in the long term.</p><p id="Par47">The structure of our cohort was comparable with other studies in terms of age, gender distribution, abscess localisation and dental focus which ensures good transferability of the results.</p><p id="Par48">As part of the quantitative analysis of the NGS swab, the absolute cell count was lower in patients in whom no bacteria could be detected in the conventional swab. If a hypothetical threshold value of microorganisms required for cultivation is not reached, germ detection is not achieved with conventional analysis. Thereby, the increased sensitivity of the gene-based analysis makes detection possible. A comparison of the two swab shows that gene-based diagnostics are superior, particularly in the detection of anaerobic bacteria, which emphasises the difficulties of conventional diagnostics for anaerobic bacteria. For the cultivation of bacteria, living organisms are required. Unfortunately there is an almost unavoidable contact with oxygen after the swab collection and during the pre-analytical phase. Hence many bacteria perish, which leads to a lack of detection. When detecting aerobic bacteria, both wound swabs therefore performed similarly, confirming the anaerobic gap for conventional analysis. The same could probably apply to the detection of fungi, as their cultivation is also associated with various pitfalls. The detection of antibiotic resistance by means of an inhibiting areola analysis also requires living organisms for cultivation. Without cultivation of bacteria, conventional resistance testing is not possible. In addition to the problems of detecting anaerobic germs, antibiotic testing is therefore impossible in many cases. This is not necessary for the detection of resistance genes using the gene-based analysis, which could explain the superiority of the NGS swab.</p><p id="Par49">In addition to a comparison of diagnostic options, this study was intended to investigate the effects of both antibiotic treatment and the resistance situation on the LOS. In this regard, different studies have already shown that certain indicators such as blood values (C-reactive protein, white blood count) have an influence on the LOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In terms of anti-infective therapy, we were able to confirm that pre-hospital antibiotic therapy leads to a shorter hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This might indicate that in most cases an effective antibiotic therapy is prescribed by the outpatient colleagues.</p><p id="Par50">Furthermore, we were able to show that a deviation from the standard therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in favor of clindamycin or piperacillin/tazobactam tends to prolong the LOS. This could be due to a poorer resistance situation to clindamycin, which we use in cases of penicillin allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Patients who suffered from more severe infections or who showed resistance in the conventional swab received piperacillin/tazobactamen. Both, a more pronounced infection and a higher incidence of antibiotic resistances can explain the prolonged LOS.</p><p id="Par51">The fact that the time until the use of the correct antibiotic plays a role could also explain that patients with a resistance detected in the conventional smear showed a tendency towards prolonged hospitalisation, as a possibly less effective therapy was used up to this point. The LOS was not influenced by resistance gene detection using NGS in this study. This is explained by the fact, that in this study, the NGS analysis was not performed in a nearby lab, resulting in a delay of the results. Hence NGS results were not, as possible in another setting, able to influence clinical treatment. However, in a real-time hospital-based setting, NGS workflows can deliver results within 24&#8211;48 h, which is even faster than conventional culturing for anaerobic bacteria. This could enable earlier adjustments in antibiotic therapy, potentially improving outcomes and reducing hospitalisation times.</p><p id="Par52">The detection of a resistance gene is not synonymous with resistance detected in culture diagnostics. Thus, an existing resistance gene does not necessarily manifest itself in clinical antibiotic resistance, which points to the greatest limitation of gene-based microbiological diagnostics and this study. Regarding the other limitations of this study, the small sample size and its monocentric design must also be mentioned.</p><p id="Par53">Data from our study suggest that gene-based microbiological analysis is superior to conventional analysis in the detection of microorganisms and antibiotic resistance in odontogenic infections. However, it remains to be seen whether this advantage translates into improved outcomes for patients in a real-world setting.</p><p id="Par54">We were able to show that the selection of an antibiotic therapy tailored to the triggering germ spectrum influences the treatment results of patients. Thus, patients with antibiotic-resistant germs that required broader antibiotic agents remained hospitalised longer, which can be explained by a delay caused by conventional antibiotic resistance testing. Whether this situation could be improved by a gene-based microbiological analysis cannot be answered within the framework of this observational study, given the fact that the results of the NGS analysis were not immediately available and therefore could not influence the patients'treatment. Thus, further prospective studies with higher levels of evidence are needed to investigate whether gene-based microbiological analysis will improve the treatment outcomes of patients with odontogenic abscesses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par55">This study highlights the potential advantages of NGS in the microbiological diagnosis of odontogenic abscesses. Our findings demonstrate that gene-based microbiological analysis is superior to conventional methods, particularly in detecting anaerobic bacteria and antibiotic resistance. The ability of NGS to identify pathogens and resistance genes independent of bacterial cultivation addresses a critical limitation of traditional diagnostics, which often fail to detect anaerobes due to oxygen exposure during sample processing.</p><p id="Par56">Despite these advantages, our study did not establish a direct impact of NGS on clinical outcomes, such as the LOS, primarily due to the delayed availability of sequencing results. This underscores the importance of integrating NGS into real-time clinical workflows to assess its potential benefits in optimizing targeted antibiotic therapy. Our findings reinforce that early, appropriate antibiotic therapy significantly influences patient outcomes, with resistant infections leading to prolonged hospitalisation due to delays in adjusting treatment regimens.</p><p id="Par57">The integration of rapid gene-based diagnostics into routine clinical practice could therefore enhance the management of odontogenic infections by enabling more precise and timely antibiotic stewardship.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Felix Benjamin Warwas and Felix Thol shared first authorship.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>FT, FBW, NH: conceptualization, methodology, project administration.
