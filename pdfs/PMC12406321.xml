It is estimated that 10-30% of those who had COVID-19 suffer from this condition [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1&#8211;3</xref>], which is defined as symptoms that are newly developed or still present at three months after acute infection, last for at least two months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies suggest that COVID-19 can lead to renal impairment, likely <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the virus&#8217; spike proteins binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) on the surface of kidney cells, allowing the virus to fuze with the host cells and contribute to acute kidney injury (AKI) [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#8211;7</xref>]. Several studies have reported AKI (defined as an increase in creatinine of &#8805;50% or a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &#8805;25% [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]) in approximately 10-20% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Another study reported a mild renal impairment (defined as an eGFR of &lt;90&#8201;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) in approximately 50% of COVID-19 patients after 12&#8201;months, with one in seven having a more severe impairment (&lt;60&#8201;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It has also been reported that, over 12&#8201;months, renal function declined by approximately 3.4% (2.96&#8201;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) with those who were hospitalized having the largest reduction (6.7%). Several risk factors for impaired renal function in relation to COVID-19 have been identified, including sex, COVID-19 severity, and comorbidities [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. COVID-19 patients who develop AKI have significantly worse outcomes, may develop chronic kidney disease (CKD), require dialysis [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], or die prematurely [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For example, in a group of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU, 33.3% of the patients with AKI died, compared with 8.9% of the non-AKI patients [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>It is still largely unknown whether the renal impairment observed in post COVID-19 patients is temporary or whether it persists long term. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine kidney function (<italic toggle="yes">via</italic> eGFR) during the acute phase, at 3&#8211;6&#8201;months and at 12&#8211;18&#8201;months after infection in the P4O2 COVID-19 cohort. The second aim is to study the associations between patient characteristics and eGFR in post COVID-19 patients. The third aim is to compare eGFR between post COVID-19 patients and controls (i.e., a group of participants without post COVID-19).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" disp-level="1" id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="S0002-S2001"><title>Study design and population</title><sec disp-level="3" id="S0002-S2001-S3001"><title>Post COVID-19 patients</title><p>The P4O2 COVID-19 study is a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study in the Netherlands.

To study the associations between patient characteristics and eGFR in post COVID-19 patients, univariable linear mixed models were developed, including all three timepoints with a random intercept on patient level. In these models, eGFR was used as the outcome and the patient characteristics as determinants. Due to the small number of participants per group, binary variables were created for each categorical determinant: ethnicity (Caucasian vs. other), level of education (university or higher professional education (high) vs. no education or primary or secondary education (low)), and smoking status (current or ex smoker vs. never smoker).

Second, to evaluate any potential role of cardiovascular drivers of kidney disease, analysis was performed restricted only to those without CVD or hypertension. Third, to evaluate the wider role of comorbidities, this was expanded to exclude participants with any prior comorbidities (CVD/hypertension, diabetes, auto-immune disease, or pulmonary disease).

Within this group, the eGFR was lower for older participants, those who were hospitalized or those with a history of CVD or hypertension. The eGFR was higher in the control group compared to the post COVID-19 patients. This difference appeared even larger 12&#8211;18&#8201;months after COVID-19.</p><p>These findings are consistent with those published elsewhere where a reduced eGFR has been reported at 12&#8201;months or more following COVID-19 [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In a study of 2,212 patients, who had long-COVID, Atiquzzaman et&#160;al. [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported a decrease in eGFR of 2.96&#8201;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> within one year after infection, consistent with the 2.93&#8201;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> decrease at 12&#8211;18&#8201;months after infection reported in the current study. Furthermore, they reported that 40% were at moderate to high risk of developing CKD based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 prognosis guidelines. Their study population was broadly comparable to that within the present paper (for example, mean age of 56 versus 54 here and 51% male 51% here) with the exception of diabetes, which had a prevalence of approximately twice of that in the current population (35% versus 16%). Bento et&#160;al. [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported a reduction from 95.9&#8201;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> at infection to 65.9&#8201;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> at 16&#8201;months after infection, a larger reduction than reported in the current study. However, they included patients who developed AKI after COVID-19, compared to our inclusion of post COVID-19 patients regardless of whether they had AKI, which likely explains why they observed a more marked reduction than that reported here.</p><p>Similarly, when comparing to a control population, Schmidt-Lauber et&#160;al. [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported that COVID-19 patients had a 1.84&#8201;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> lower eGFR than controls at nine months after infection. They used a non-COVID-19 control group, matched on age, sex and education. However, while they found a slightly lower eGFR in COVID-19 cases, they found no evidence for ongoing kidney disease after mild or moderate COVID-19. Boruga et&#160;al. [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] used COVID-19 cases who did not develop post COVID-19 as a control group, reporting a lower eGFR in post COVID-19 patients compared to the control group at six months after infection (65.3&#8201;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> vs. 91.2&#8201;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>Age is a well known risk factor for acute and chronic kidney injury, with a recent meta-analysis reporting that kidney function recovery after AKI is impaired in individuals aged &gt; 65&#8201;years [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This appears to extend to renal impairment following COVID-19 with recent studies reporting that reduced eGFR due to COVID-19 was associated with higher age [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], consistent with the findings reported here. Being hospitalized has also been reported as a risk factor for reduced eGFR in post COVID-19 patients [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which is consistent with our observations.</p><p>It is also well known that diabetes is a risk factor for kidney disease [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but its interaction with COVID-19 remains unclear. Guzman-Esquivel et&#160;al. [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported a protective effect of having diabetes, where patients with diabetes had a higher eGFR after COVID-19 compared to non-diabetic patients. Conversely, Atiquzzaman et&#160;al. [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported a larger decline in eGFR for diabetic patients. The findings of the current study do not align with either study, as we found no effect of diabetes on eGFR in the post COVID-19 group. These differences could be due to differences in population selection. The study of Guzman-Esquivel et&#160;al. only included unvaccinated patients whereas Atiquzzaman et&#160;al. included patients aged &#8805;18&#8201;years and had a higher prevalence of diabetic patients. In the current study, we included patients aged between 40 and 65&#8201;years, regardless of vaccination status.</p><p>While CVD can be a risk factor for kidney disease (and vice-versa) [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], no other study, to our knowledge, has investigated the association between CVD and eGFR in post COVID-19 patients. However, Mirijello et&#160;al. [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported that the percentage of patients with hypertension was higher in post COVID-19 patients with eGFR &lt;60&#8201;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> compared to eGFR &#8805;60&#8201;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (66.7% vs. 39.9%).</p><sec disp-level="2" id="S0007-S2001"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The current study has several strengths, including a well-defined cohort and the use of a control group, which allowed us to identify a difference in eGFR between having post COVID-19 and those who do not. However, as the control group was both younger and healthier (i.e., fewer comorbidities), these findings must be interpreted with caution. In an effort to address this limitation we performed several sensitivity analyses in order to make the control and post COVID-19 groups more comparable, typically finding consistent results across these tests (except for restricting by age), providing support for the current findings.</p><p>Despite its strengths, the current study also has some limitations. First, no information on pre-COVID renal function was available, limiting our ability to conclude whether the impaired renal function observed here was primarily due to COVID-19 or preexisting infection (although we note similar findings after removing those with co-morbidities). Similarly, we were unable to evaluate whether participants were reviewed by nephrologists during their hospital admission, nor whether they received any post-discharge nephrological care. However, in a study by Guzman-Esquivel et&#160;al. [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], who did compare pre-COVID renal function, it was reported that 30% of the patients with a normal eGFR (&#8805;90&#8201;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) pre-COVID had a reduced eGFR one year after infection, indicating that a low eGFR could be caused by COVID-19. A second limitation is the relatively small sample size, limiting statistical power. When performing the regression analyses, some groups contained only a few persons, therefore leading to higher uncertainty. Third, eGFR was the only metric utilized to examine kidney function, with no information on urine content (e.g., proteinuria) or histology being available, limiting a wider evaluation of the clinical impact of the observed findings. Fourth, the control group used in the current study was somewhat different from the post COVID-19 group, both in terms of age and comorbidities, limiting the extent to which these groups can be compared. However, in a series of sensitivity analyses, designed to improve comparability between these groups, consistent overall findings were found with those of the main analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="S0008"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current paper reports a reduced eGFR up to 18-months following COVID-19 which was also associated with a higher age and CVD/hypertension. Furthermore, a difference in eGFR between post COVID-19 patients and controls was observed. These results suggest that, among patients who are developing (or who have developed) post COVID-19 condition, renal function should be monitored. Future research should focus on longer term outcomes, including whether the observed renal impairment leads to any clinical manifestation. Furthermore, to fully assess kidney function, additional variables like proteinuria and albumin levels should be considered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM3341" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Renal_Failure_long_COVID_Fig_S1_DAG.jpeg</title></caption><media xlink:href="IRNF_A_2551737_SM3341.jpeg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM3340" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplementary materials_resubmission.docx</title></caption><media xlink:href="IRNF_A_2551737_SM3340.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Acknowledgements are given to all the patients and healthcare professionals who contributed to the P4O2 COVID-19 study.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" disp-level="1" id="S0010"><title>Data sharing statement</title><p>The data underlying this article are not publicly available due to agreements made by the consortium, which only allow access by each consortium partner to specific data that answers their pre-specified research questions, but they are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.
