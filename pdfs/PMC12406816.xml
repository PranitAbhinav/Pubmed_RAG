A large market of devices to monitor infants&#8217; real-time health information during sleep has emerged, including smart cameras, under-mattress sensors and wearable devices. The impacts of these products on maternal and parental mental health and medical decision-making are poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a systematic search for products detecting health data from sleeping children on the global retail platform Amazon in March 2023. A total of 11&#8201;262 unique reviews from 48 eligible products were retrieved from the USA, Canada, UK, and Australia sites and subjected to sentiment and thematic analyses to capture the characteristics of user families, contexts of device use and impacts on maternal and child health.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Parental anxiety and infants&#8217; high-risk medical status were cited by families as the main reasons to purchase products. When devices worked well, their use was associated with improved parental sleep quality and decreased anxiety. However, poor device performance was commonly reported and was linked to increased parental stress and anxiety and disrupted child sleep. Users reported making medical decisions based on device output. Price, privacy, and unsafe use of devices emerged as ethical issues.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Use of a smart sleep device in the home is common and has implications for the health of both children and adults. Benefits and harms must be understood by parents and healthcare providers in order to support evidence-based decision-making around their use.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Sleep</kwd><kwd>Infant</kwd><kwd>Ethics</kwd><kwd>Qualitative research</kwd><kwd>Technology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012285</institution-id><institution>BC Children&#8217;s Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N/A</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000245</institution-id><institution>Michael Smith Health Research BC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Trainee Award (Grant # N/A)</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>BC Children&#8217;s Hospital Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N/A</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship (Grant # N/A)</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><sec><title>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC</title><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>Many households monitor sleeping children&#8217;s health using emerging &#8216;smart&#8217; commercial products such as cameras, sensors, and wearables.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The medical community is not yet prepared to offer evidence-based recommendations about these practices, despite their widespread adoption and potential intersection with the healthcare system.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS</title><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>By conducting a content analysis of a large corpus of consumer reviews, we find evidence that these devices impact maternal and parental mental health, children&#8217;s sleep quality and safety, and family usage of healthcare services.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE, OR POLICY</title><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>These results will inform future development of recommendations for sleep device use.</p></list-item><list-item><p>With a better understanding of how these devices affect user families, parents can be more equipped to make evidence-informed decisions for their family&#8217;s health.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Managing household sleep can be a challenging early parenthood experience.

Privacy Badger blocks third-party trackers, including advertisements that track the user, and prevents them from loading content into the browser. The uBlock Origin extension is a content blocker that uses preset filter lists to block all third-party network requests. Browsing data were cleared between each search.

Discussion
</title><p>While sensors to monitor infant breathing have a long history of use in clinical contexts, their widespread commercial availability and the normalisation of their use for healthy children are more recent phenomena. As the interface through which millions of parents monitor their children daily, these devices have enormous potential to impact maternal mental health, decision-making on behalf of children and use of healthcare resources.</p><p>Our dataset consists of over 11 000 product reviews containing personal, emotional details about families&#8217; sleep challenges, household finances, and medical histories. These data have high ecological validity, as user-generated online content is a rich source of data about parents&#8217; experiences and decision-making related to children&#8217;s health.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9 29</sup></xref> We verified the quality of our dataset using a third-party tool, and the majority of all reviews were associated with registered purchases. All three independent coders who handled the reviews (totalling hundreds of reviews per coder) reported that they were relevant to the correct products and did not show evidence of manipulation, providing us with a high degree of confidence in their veracity. The data were analysed in two complementary ways. Sentiment analysis was also applied to the full dataset, revealing its emotional content. Targeted, fine-grained thematic content analysis was performed on a subset of reviews to elicit their key themes, an established method to evaluate online health content.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">920 29</xref><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Understanding the user base for these products is key to creating future public health messaging in this space. In our data, users of these products were largely the parents of children under the age of 6&#8201;months old and referenced a mental health history characterised by anxiety and worry, with or without a clinical diagnosis. Children&#8217;s medical histories, such as prematurity or neonatal hospitalisation, were referenced. If healthcare providers would like to counsel families around the purchase of smart sleep monitors, this should be done prenatally. Parents with a history of anxiety and families at a high risk of premature birth or neonatal medical complexity would be particularly relevant populations to receive this information. Discharge from NICU could be another key opportunity for these discussions.</p><p>A strength of the present work is our ability to capture the experiences of users who have discontinued using their sleep sensors, unlike the majority of studies, which have focused on active users. These missing perspectives are important to capture the true balance of benefits and harms. Reports of poor device performance were very common (one-third of all reviews) and were associated with parental frustration and anxiety, sleep disruption for both parents and children, and discontinuation of product use. For medical staff, non-actionable alarms increase response time to actionable alarms;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> there is evidence of a similar pattern here, with parents reporting that poor device performance led them to abandon their devices despite wishing for the promised safety functionality. These outcomes, combined with the high price point of many products in this category, raise questions around the ethics of normalising or recommending the use of these products by all families, especially when equitable access to healthcare is challenging.</p><p>In our analysis, we were particularly interested in the impact of smart sleep sensors on parental mental health. The literature contains reports of these devices as both increasing<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6 21 22</sup></xref> and alleviating anxiety.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8 21</sup></xref> Our data are more consistent with the latter, though it is important to note that Amazon reviews reflect self-reported emotional experiences rather than clinical insights. The claims in the reviews are non-standardised, influenced by the context of review-writing as a particular genre, and may reflect short-term states rather than enduring mental health conditions. Parents typically reported a reduction in anxiety or &#8216;peace of mind&#8217; in association with their use, as well as improved sleep (so long as devices functioned normally). We are not able to discriminate between two scenarios here: in one, anxious families may be justifiably reassured that their infants are well; in the other, families may be inappropriately reassured that devices can be relied on to catch dangerous incidents and may reduce checking or rely on devices during unsafe sleep practices.</p><p>A small number of parents reported taking medical actions based on sensor output, including rousing unresponsive infants and seeking out medical services. These outcomes, if clinically verified, would represent the best-case scenario for these products and were more common for wearables and bed sensors than smart cameras. It is important to be clear that we are not able to objectively determine the nature of these subjective reports; device accuracy and clinical diagnoses are not known within this dataset. It may be most appropriate to consider events where sleep sensors go off to be &#8216;apparent life-threatening events&#8217;, a category that carries risk but is not synonymous with SIDS.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14 33</sup></xref> A more minor health outcome that also appeared in the data was children being woken by malfunctioning devices or by parents responding to known false alarms. Devices also impact children indirectly by shaping their parents&#8217; decision-making. Some describe checking on their children less often when using sensors. Others used the devices to support children&#8217;s sleep outside of typically recommended contexts, including bed-sharing, using swings, and placing young infants in prone positions. We did not find any evidence of emotional disconnection between parent and child. Overall, we find strong evidence that parent-perceived children&#8217;s health is impacted by the use of these technologies.</p><p>Our methodology captures rich data about the benefits and harms of smart sleep device use by a large sample of real families in their communities. However, relying on user-generated content has trade-offs. First, it is likely that certain perspectives are over-represented; families with particularly positive or negative experiences may be more likely to leave product reviews. Second, demographics such as age, gender, location and socioeconomic status are unknown. Considering known disparities in access to health technology and online platforms,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> it is likely that these dynamics are replicated in our sample and that racialised, linguistically diverse, and low-income perspectives are under-represented. Further work will be needed to better characterise the true demographics of users and to ensure proportionate representation. In the absence of the full spectrum of perspectives, it is difficult to know whether these devices have a different balance of harms and benefits for marginalised populations such as disabled or medically vulnerable children and parents. Third, relying on product reviews cannot capture the dynamics of using these products over time. Fourth, there are limitations in our ability to infer true mental health states using online reviews;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29 31</sup></xref> online content written for a public audience may differ from content that is private, and we cannot verify parents&#8217; reports with any clinical data using this design. Further studies can mitigate these issues using experimental and longitudinal methods.</p><p>To conclude, in an analysis of over 11 000 product reviews, we investigated the impact of the widespread use of infant sleep sensors in naturalistic home environments on maternal and child health. Families using smart sleep devices tended to report parental peace of mind and improved sleep. A small minority report that the products detected important medical events, while others used the tools to support unsafe sleep practices. Poor device performance was both common and highly stressful. Wearables and bed sensors were more likely than smart cameras to be purchased by families reporting a pattern of anxiety for parents and medical risk (prematurity and/or NICU stay) for children. Price was an emerging ethical issue. This work is a first step towards the development of evidence-based resources for health experts and parents about real-world risks and benefits of using these devices.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a Michael Smith Health Research BC Fellowship to JAD (Grant # N/A), a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Fellowship to JAD (Grant # N/A), funding from BC Children&#8217;s Hospital Research Institute to JMR (Grant # N/A) and from the BC Children&#8217;s Hospital Foundation to JMR (Grant # N/A).
