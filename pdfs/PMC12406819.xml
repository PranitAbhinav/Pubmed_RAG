In 2022, the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the WHO reported approximately 662&#8201;301 new cases and 348&#8201;874 deaths worldwide, with nearly 90% of fatalities occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where access to screening and vaccination is often inadequate.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 2</sup></xref> In 2022, there were 8662 new cases and 4576 deaths from cervical cancer in Thailand.

HPV vaccination is recommended for individuals aged 9&#8211;45 years (both males and females), with a focus on girls aged 11&#8211;12 years.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6 7</sup></xref> However, in Thailand, HPV vaccination coverage remains low among eligible women, and many do not adhere to recommended screening guidelines, particularly those in low-income urban and rural areas.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8 9</sup></xref> This gap in preventive healthcare increases the risk of late-stage cervical cancer diagnoses, leading to higher morbidity and mortality rates.</p><p>Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, is a highly urbanised area with marked socioeconomic diversity. The Din Daeng district, located in central Bangkok, is one of the most densely populated communities in the city. With a total area of 8.354 square kilometres and a population of 122,563, the population density is approximately 14&#8201;590 persons per square kilometre, compared with the national average of 136 persons per square kilometre.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The district is home to many low-income households and informal workers. Although public health services are available through local health promotion hospitals, barriers such as limited health literacy, overcrowded living conditions and inconsistent access to preventive care remain. Dindaeng exemplifies the challenges faced by urban low-income populations in accessing essential health services, including cervical cancer screening.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Previous research highlights key barriers to screening participation, including financial constraints, limited awareness, cultural stigma, fear of procedures and misconceptions about cervical cancer.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12 13</sup></xref> These factors contribute to low screening adherence and underutilisation of HPV vaccination programmes, exacerbating health disparities.</p><p>Despite national initiatives to promote cervical cancer screening, critical gaps in knowledge and screening adherence persist, particularly among marginalised communities. Most studies in Thailand focus on hospital-based populations, leaving a significant knowledge gap regarding real-world challenges in urban underserved settings.</p><p>This study aims to assess women&#8217;s knowledge of cervical cancer and its prevention in the Dindaeng community, evaluate screening uptake and adherence, identify barriers to participation and analyse demographic influences on screening behaviour. By identifying key determinants, the findings can inform targeted public health strategies to improve screening and vaccination rates in urban low-income areas. Strengthening community-driven initiatives, healthcare infrastructure and data collection systems is essential for ensuring equitable access. Addressing these gaps will ultimately contribute to reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality among Thai women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design and Population</title><p>This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Dindaeng community, in Bangkok, Thailand, from October to December 2024. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University (IRB No. 0059/67). Eligible participants were women aged 25&#8211;65 years who resided in the community and were able to read and write Thai. Literacy was required to ensure independent completion of the self-administered questionnaire and to minimise interviewer bias. Women who had a history of cervical cancer, prior hysterectomy or difficulty in reading/writing were excluded.</p><p>The sample size was calculated based on a previous study conducted in a similar urban Thai population by Chaowawanit et al<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>, which examined cervical cancer screening behaviour and knowledge among women living in Bangkok.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> This prior study, conducted between 2014 and 2015, reported a screening adequacy proportion of 0.43 and a good knowledge proportion of 0.26.

Each correct answer was awarded one point. Total scores were converted to percentages and categorised into three levels: low (&lt;50%), moderate (50&#8211;69%) and high (70&#8211;100%).</p><p>Screening behaviour outcomes were assessed using self-reported questionnaire items. Lifetime screening was determined by the question, &#8216;Have you ever had a cervical cancer screening?&#8217; Up-to-date screening status was based on whether participants had undergone screening within the past 3 years. Regular screening was defined as self-reported screening at 1&#8211;3-year intervals, in accordance with previous national guidelines recommending cytology-based screening in the population.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p>Barriers to screening were assessed using a structured list of commonly reported obstacles derived from previous studies.

was strongly associated with higher knowledge scores (AOR=10.71, 95%&#8201;CI: 1.29 to 89.12). In contrast, the use of oral contraceptives was negatively associated with achieving a high knowledge score (AOR=0.14, 95%&#8201;CI: 0.03 to 0.74).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study highlights significant gaps in knowledge and practices&#8212;and attitudinal barriers such as fear, embarrassment and misconceptions about the need for screening&#8212;related to cervical cancer screening among women in the Dindaeng community, an underserved urban area in Bangkok. Dindaeng was selected as the study site due to its high population density, socioeconomic disadvantages and limited access to healthcare services&#8212;characteristics that make it representative of urban communities at heightened risk for low screening uptake.</p><p>Although the overall screening rate (65.4%) aligns with national estimates, only 29.3% of those screened adhered to recommended screening intervals. This gap in regular screening suggests that while awareness of screening exists, consistent participation remains a challenge. The lifetime screening rate of 65.4%, although comparable to previous studies in urban Thailand, remains suboptimal when considering national goals for cervical cancer elimination. This may reflect better access in an urban setting and possibly an overestimation due to the inclusion of only literate participants, who may be more likely to engage in screening.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Screening behaviour and influencing factors</title><p>The cervical cancer screening rate in this study, at 65.4%, is consistent with national estimates from previous Thai studies, which report screening rates ranging from 46% to 64%. However, this figure still falls short of Thailand&#8217;s national screening target of 70%. While the majority of participants had undergone screening at least once in their lifetime, only 19.1% adhered to the recommended screening intervals. For comparison, the HPV Fact Sheet for Thailand reports that 43% of women had been screened within the past 3 years. Although multiple screening methods&#8212;including cytology, HPV testing, cotesting and VIA&#8212;are available in Thailand, overall adherence to regular screening remains suboptimal.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> These findings reflect a need for improved strategies to promote regular screening behaviour, especially in underserved urban communities. Similar patterns have been observed in other Southeast Asian countries, where cervical cancer screening tends to be infrequent rather than routine.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The irregularity in screening behaviours may be attributed to several factors, including a low perceived risk of cervical cancer, misconceptions about the necessity of screening when symptoms are absent and systemic barriers such as limited access to healthcare and financial constraints.</p><p>Women who had ever been screened tended to be younger, married and more educated. Multivariable analysis confirmed that women with a history of sexual intercourse were nearly ten times more likely to have been screened. This aligns with the rationale for screening targeting sexually active women and highlights the need for early engagement.</p><p>Interestingly, women under 29 were significantly less likely to be screened. This may reflect inadequate risk perception among younger women or a lack of targeted messaging. A positive association between underlying diseases and screening suggests that contact with healthcare services facilitates preventive behaviours.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Knowledge regarding cervical cancer prevention</title><p>Knowledge gaps about cervical cancer and HPV were substantial, with only 31.8% of participants correctly identifying HPV as the primary cause of cervical cancer. Similar low awareness levels have been reported in other Thai studies, as well as in neighbouring countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">1117</xref><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Although 23.8% of participants were aware that HPV vaccination could prevent cervical cancer, this figure remains far below the knowledge levels seen in high-income countries, where vaccination awareness campaigns have been more effective.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Increasing HPV education through school-based and community health initiatives could significantly improve vaccine uptake and, ultimately, reduce cervical cancer incidence.</p><p>The finding that only 10.5% of participants understood the recommended frequency of cervical cancer screening underscores a broader issue of inadequate dissemination of screening guidelines. Previous studies have demonstrated that even among women who have undergone screening, many lack a clear understanding of when they should return for subsequent tests.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24 25</sup></xref> Public health campaigns should not only promote initial screening but also emphasise the importance of repeat screening at regular intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Barriers and misconceptions</title><p>The most prevalent barrier identified was the misconception that cervical cancer screening is unnecessary in the absence of symptoms. This belief was reported by 71.6% of never-screened women and 45.7% of those who had been screened, highlighting a significant and widespread knowledge gap. Consistent with findings from other LMICs,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> this misconception often led participants to delay or forgo screening altogether. Addressing this barrier through targeted, community-based education emphasising the importance of early detection even in asymptomatic individuals is critical.</p><p>The second most commonly reported barrier was fear of the screening procedure itself, including concerns about pain, embarrassment and the risk of infection. These anxieties were reported by 55.4% of never-screened women and 35.0% of those who had been screened (p&lt;0.001), highlighting psychosocial deterrents to screening. Often shaped by cultural norms and misconceptions about gynaecological exams, these concerns reinforce the importance of delivering health education in a culturally sensitive and community-specific manner to promote screening uptake.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14 26</sup></xref></p><p>Logistical issues (eg, time, cost, distance) were less frequently reported but still relevant. Although Thailand provides free cervical cancer screening through its Universal Health Coverage system, indirect costs such as transportation, lost wages and childcare responsibilities may prevent women from attending screening appointments. Mobile units, flexible clinic hours and screening incorporated into primary care visits can address these structural barriers.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p><p>Furthermore, women with one or no children were significantly more likely to achieve high knowledge scores related to cervical cancer and its prevention, possibly due to fewer caregiving responsibilities and greater opportunity to engage in health education. Conversely, although contraceptive use was associated with a higher likelihood of screening participation, it was negatively linked with knowledge levels. This contrast suggests that while family planning services may effectively deliver screening, they might insufficiently address cervical cancer education. These findings highlight the complex interplay between reproductive history, contraceptive behaviour, health literacy and preventive practices, reinforcing the need for integrated education strategies within reproductive health and primary care settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Policy implications</title><p>The findings from this study underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions to improve cervical cancer screening rates and knowledge in underserved urban communities. Policymakers should consider expanding community-based education programmes, integrating cervical cancer screening into routine primary healthcare visits and increasing mobile screening services to reach women facing access barriers.</p><p>Additionally, evidence-based strategies&#8212;such as digital health tools (eg, SMS reminders), social media campaigns and provider-led community outreach&#8212;may also be effective in improving screening adherence and addressing misinformation surrounding cervical cancer prevention.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28 29</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Study strengths and limitations</title><p>This study provides valuable insights into the real-world barriers to cervical cancer screening in a low-income urban setting, using a community-based approach and a large sample size. The use of a validated questionnaire and multivariate analysis strengthens the reliability of the findings.</p><p>However, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the cross-sectional design prevents causal inferences between knowledge levels and screening behaviours. Future longitudinal studies are needed to track screening adherence over time. Second, the study was conducted in a single urban community, limiting its generalisability to other Thai populations, particularly those in rural areas. Comparative studies between urban and rural populations would be beneficial. Third, self-reported data may be subject to recall bias or social desirability bias, particularly regarding screening history. Future studies could use medical records to validate self-reported screening behaviours. Fourth, the requirement for participants to read and write Thai in order to complete the self-administered questionnaire may have excluded non-literate individuals, particularly those from disadvantaged or migrant backgrounds. While literacy rates in Bangkok are estimated to be over 97%, this criterion may have limited the generalisability of the findings to the entire community.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Future research directions</title><p>To build on these findings, future work should evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of evidence-based interventions to increase cervical cancer screening in underserved communities. In addition, qualitative studies could offer valuable insights into cultural and psychological factors influencing screening uptake.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite moderate screening rates, substantial knowledge gaps and misconceptions persist among women in these community-based urban settings. Addressing barriers related to access, misinformation and fear through targeted health education programmes and community-based interventions could improve screening adherence. Increasing HPV vaccination awareness and making screening services more accessible through community healthcare and flexible clinic hours should be prioritised in future public health efforts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2025-100896</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s001.doc" id="d67e1353" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was funded by Thailand Science Research and Innovation (grant number HEAF67300053).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Prepublication history and additional supplemental material for this paper are available online.
