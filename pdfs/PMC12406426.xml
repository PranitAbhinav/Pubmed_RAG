Incomplete or missing information on occupational background, stemming from non-mandatory reporting in routine patient history taking, has led to the underreporting of cases. This study aimed to evaluate the availability of occupational data in the medical records of cancer patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study was conducted from May to September 2023 in two oncology centres in the Klang Valley. These centres have different record keeping systems, with one utilizing an electronic system and the other using a paper-based system. Medical records of cancer patients were screened for availability of occupational details. Data were then collected from 962 medical records of patients with documented history of working and 314 patients were interviewed regarding their occupational history to compare with the records. Descriptive analyses of frequency for available occupational details and chi-square tests were performed with statistical significance set at p &lt; 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The centre with paper-based record keeping system had higher recorded occupational details at 88.5%. The availability of specific types of occupational details was mostly higher among electronic medical records. The highest information recorded in medical records was for occupational classification (81.1%) and lowest for occupational exposure (0.2%), which is one of the most crucial pieces of information in establishing occupational cancer diagnosis. When comparing between medical records and interviews, only 65.3% demonstrated similarity in capturing the work classification. Additionally, 23.6% of data were incomplete or missing, and thus could not be compared. Another 8.9% showed some discrepancy in the classification.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">This study underscores the need for improvement in collecting detailed occupational history from cancer patients. Identification of possible occupational exposure is a fundamental step in determining the possibility of work-related cancer. </p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12889-025-24284-w.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Occupation</kwd><kwd>Work-related</kwd><kwd>Oncology centre</kwd><kwd>Medical records</kwd><kwd>Malaysia</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Health Malaysia</institution></funding-source><award-id>NMRR ID-22-00745-72C</award-id><award-id>NMRR ID-22-00745-72C</award-id><award-id>NMRR ID-22-00745-72C</award-id><award-id>NMRR ID-22-00745-72C</award-id><award-id>NMRR ID-22-00745-72C</award-id><award-id>NMRR ID-22-00745-72C</award-id><award-id>NMRR ID-22-00745-72C</award-id><award-id>NMRR ID-22-00745-72C</award-id><award-id>NMRR ID-22-00745-72C</award-id><award-id>NMRR ID-22-00745-72C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Mohamad</surname><given-names>Nadia</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Rajendiran</surname><given-names>Sakshaleni</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Khairul Hasni</surname><given-names>Nurul Amalina</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Nik Hassan</surname><given-names>Nik Muhammad Nizam</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Ahmad Bustamam</surname><given-names>Ros Suzanna</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Bilang</surname><given-names>Nolia Luhong</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Omar</surname><given-names>Mohd Azahadi</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Md Yazin</surname><given-names>Nik Khairol Reza</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Ismail</surname><given-names>Rohaida</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par13">Cancer is a complex disease influenced by various risk factors and often involves a long latency period, making it difficult in ascertaining its root causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, most occupational or work-related cancer have identifiable causes, often linked to specific exposures, that are preventable through control or elimination of hazardous agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has listed some of the carcinogens related to occupational cancer such as radiation, industrial chemicals and night shift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, documenting relevant occupational history and workplace exposure data is an essential steps in understanding the potential link between occupation and cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Cancer registries can serve as a valuable tool for supporting epidemiological studies on occupational cancer, provided they are effectively designed and maintained to capture relevant occupational information from patients&#8217; medical records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>],. Furthermore, in a developed country, occupational cancer surveillance system was reported as a feasible method in identifying hazardous agents&#8217; exposure among the workers at the local and national level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">In Malaysia, effort to establish a cancer registry began in 1993, initially involving a few states, and later expanded to all states by 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This effort has led to an increase in documented cancer cases, despite the reporting system being voluntary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Comprehensive cancer registration in Malaysia was achieved through a combination of passive and active case-finding methods, utilizing multiple data sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Initially, the data were collected manually via hardcopy forms and entered into the CanReg5 computerised database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A significant technological advancement took place in 2018 with the introduction of online cancer case reporting, further enhanced by the mandatory implementation of online cancer notifications in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Consequently, reported cancer cases increased from 115,238 in the 2012&#8211;2016 period to 168,823 in 2017&#8211;2021, reflecting a significant improvement in cancer surveillance capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Despite this progress, several gaps persist in the current registry system globally including Malaysia. One of the most critical gaps is the lack of systematic collection of information related to occupation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Considering the long latent period for some occupational cancers, and the fact that it may be diagnosed even after discontinuation of employment, capturing the occupational history can aid in both retrospective assessment of disease causes and prospective preventive efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Moreover, identifying occupational cancer is important because affected individuals may potentially receive medical compensation, insurance coverage or social protection, and it enables targeted intervention to reduce similar occurrence in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, only a limited number of occupational cancer cases are being reported globally including in Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Lack of information pertaining to occupational exposure has led to severe underreporting of work-related cancer. In 2021, the Department of Occupational Safety and Health Malaysia (DOSH) reported only one confirmed case of occupational cancer being notified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While the Malaysia Social Security Organization (SOCSO) received six claims for occupational cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Another underlying issue is the limited emphasis placed on occupational history in routine clinical documentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A study in Turkey among medical faculty physicians concluded that missing or incomplete occupational data in the medical records were due to limited training or awareness among medical practitioners on the importance of occupational history taking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The importance of capturing occupational data in Malaysia is further highlighted by the country&#8217;s economic structure. Malaysia has a diverse industrial landscape that includes manufacturing, agriculture, construction, mining and quarrying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the occupational background of cancer patients can provide critical insights into exposure-disease relationship.</p><p id="Par19">However, without reliable and accessible data, the efforts to link the occupational exposures to cancer will remain limited. Hence, assessing the feasibility of acquiring occupational data from cancer patients&#8217; medical records is the first step before designing robust epidemiological studies that investigate exposure-disease relationships. This would guide in mapping future directions towards reducing the burden of occupational cancer in Malaysia and contribute to the improvement of the cancer registry system in Malaysia. Thus, this study aimed to determine the availability of occupational data from medical record of cancer patients in oncology centres in Klang Valley, Malaysia.</p><p id="Par20">Among five oncology centres in Malaysia, Klang Valley was selected due to its high concentration of major oncology centres and the operational base of the study authors. A secondary aim of this study was to determine whether there were differences in the availability of occupational data between a centre that was still using paper-based records versus one that had transitioned to electronic medical record (EMR) systems. A digital hospital refers to a healthcare facility that aims to translate medical information into an electronic data system and utilizes information systems to store and retrieve them, with the intention of improving processes, decision making, and automation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This study also assessed the discrepancies between occupational data recorded in the paper-based record system and those obtained through patient interviews at a single site. Identifying such differences may guide targeted strategies to improve occupational data captured across varying documentation platforms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par21">This observational study was conducted between May and September 2023 in two major oncology centres in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Both oncology centres received patients from the local area and nationwide as they serve as national referral centres, providing radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and palliative care services. These two centres applied different types of record keeping with one centre using digitalized system or EMR, while the other centre used non-digitalised, paper-based medical record.</p><p id="Par22">The study was designed to assess the availability and completeness of occupational information documented in cancer patients&#8217; medical records across both settings. The availability of occupational details is defined as any occupational information documented in the medical record. During the study period, a total of 1,976 data from medical records were screened for availability of occupational details.</p><p id="Par23">In addition to medical record review, face-to-face interviews were conducted with patients at one site primarily due to study feasibility. The paper-based centre was chosen to compare patient-reported occupational history with the corresponding documentation in medical records. This approach enabled not only a comparison between manual and electronic systems, but also the reliability of recorded data through patient input (at one site).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data collection from medical record</title><p id="Par24">The inclusion criteria in obtaining occupational details were [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] Malaysian nationality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], diagnosed with any cancer after year 2020, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] has history of a minimum one year of working at one place at a time either full-time or part-time. Patients diagnosed from 2020 onwards were selected because they were more likely to still be undergoing treatment and able to participate in interviews. This also ensured that the data reflected the most recent documentation practices at both facilities. Additionally, the inclusion of recently diagnosed patients, who were more likely to be currently employed or to have ceased employment only recently, helped minimize recall bias and enhanced the accuracy of the occupational data obtained. The exclusion criteria were duplicate medical records.</p><p id="Par25">From the total 1,976 screened medical records in both centres, 962 patient&#8217;s data met the inclusion criteria and were included in further data collection and analysis. The extracted data included sociodemographic, and occupational details. The collected occupational details were: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] occupation; referred to the designation or job title [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], job classification; referred to occupational information that can at least be categorized to major groups of Malaysia Standard Classification of Occupations (MASCO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], work sector; referred to any information that could be used to categorize employment by sector according to the Institute of Labour Market Information and Analysis (ILMIA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], workplace; referred to workplace or the place where patient worked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], work duration; referred to the duration patient had stayed working in year/s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], hazardous exposure; referred to any hazards that the respondent was exposed to at work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], previous work; included any history of work in addition to current/last occupation. Occupational data that did not specify the nature of the job, such as job title, role or description that allows for appropriate classification were deemed incomplete. These occupational details were typically recorded by physicians from history taking and provided critical information for a comprehensive assessment of work-related exposure relevant to cancer diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Interviewed based questionnaire</title><p id="Par26">All 314 cancer patients from the oncology centre with paper-based record system were interviewed during their visit. These interviews were carried out only at the paper-based centre due to logistical considerations. They were conducted by trained interviewers with details of the study explained to the respondents and written informed consent obtained before the commencement of interview session. Specifically, current and past occupational details including occupation, classification, sector, workplace, duration of work, and hazardous exposure were recorded in the questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par27">Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 28.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

For this study, only work classification was compared for similarity, as it was the most consistent type of data available to capture similarities or discrepancies compared to other type of data. The similarity was categorized subjectively based on the details provided, according to the MASCO, comprising 10 major groups (MASCO,2020). When compared with medical records, 205 (65.3%) revealed similar findings. A total of 28 data (8.9%) showed discrepancies in work classification between medical records and interviews.

Identifying the link could be made more difficult among those with multiple occupations. Thus, a detailed occupational history, which includes previous work experiences and work exposures are important in identifying probable work-related cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This study found limited information on occupational details reported in the medical records from both oncology centres. The available data were also inadequate, mostly only limited to work classification (81.1%) with almost no information on exposure at the workplace (0.2%).</p><p id="Par33">The early screening process showed that the centre with paper-based record keeping system, where occupational history was written manually, had a higher percentage (88.5%) for availability of occupational information compared to centre with EMR (85.3%). The EMR system used in the studied facility includes a designated free-text field for occupational information, although it did not enforce mandatory completion. As such, the recording of occupational information depends heavily on physician awareness and initiative. Additionally, limited access to computers and lack of point-of-care documentation have been shown to delay data entry in EMR leading to data inaccuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This could also be influenced by the complexity and skills required to use the system efficiently and the lack of prompt for the entry of occupational information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Other studies have also reported dissatisfaction among clinicians with the completeness and correctness of data recorded in EMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].Additionally, the system can be more time consuming to navigate compared to handwritten records, leading to reduced time for patient interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This limitation also reflects the broader institutional or higher-level decisions made during procurement of the systems to be used in the facility.</p><p id="Par34">Despite the lower availability of occupational information in EMR from the screening data in this study, more information on specific type of occupation details were able to be categorized from this system. Higher availability of specific occupational details including job title, work classification, work sector, workplace and exposure were observed from EMR. This contrasted with the observation from one study that reported higher chance of data entry errors in the free-text field, potentially contributing to incomplete occupational information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Given the circumstances, with mandatory requirements or system design to capture detailed occupational information including exposure history in the EMR, more complete and relevant data could be documented.</p><p id="Par35">This study showed a higher availability of occupational data compared to a study in North Carolina which had about 40.3&#8211;42.2% data for type of occupation, and 43.5&#8211;42.2% for type of industry being reported from 2020 to 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Another study analysed occupational data in the Florida cancer registry among firefighters. They reported approximately 53% of occupational code were available to enable classification of workers into detailed occupations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Meanwhile, data on the duration of work, hazardous exposure and previous work were severely lacking with less than 2% of records having this information. Of note, the lack of exposure data imposes a great challenge to physician to attribute the cancer causes to specific exposures or risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Based on a review done on the occupational cancer burden in Great Britain, the population attributable fraction of total cancer as a result of occupational exposure ranged between 2% and 8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Whereas, in Italy, 0.9% of cancer diagnosed and 1.6% of cancer mortality were attributable to occupational exposure to carcinogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This implies the importance of exposure data, as a substantial proportion of cancer diagnoses were due to occupational exposure.</p><p id="Par36">When compared with patients&#8217; interview in this study, only 65.3% showed similarity in work classification as documented in the medical records, whereas, 8.9% showed total discrepancy. The discrepancy was higher compared to a study in Norway which reported 5% inconsistent information between electronic and paper-based record [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The discrepancy could also be attributed by previous occupational histories that were not captured in either the record or by the interviewer. Additionally, using systematic and comprehensive checklists that encompasses key occupational information during history taking can help in preventing discrepancies and missing data. Studies have shown that systematic screening of occupational exposures can improve the identification of work-related cancers and support compensation efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">While history taking is a key component in reaching a diagnosis, occupational history is often neglected, leading to underdiagnoses of work-related cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Occupational information is often perceived as neither useful nor urgent, and the assessment is viewed as complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The lack of knowledge and awareness among medical practitioner on the importance of occupational information and the details required to establish work-related diseases, could influence the quality of the data collected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Specifically for exposure, the intensity and duration are important information needed to establish the work-relatedness of the cancer outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Additionally, the lack of standardized definitions of exposure and diagnostic criteria for occupational diseases impedes the process of collecting this information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A comprehensive occupational history is therefore important in establishing a link between occupation and disease, which subsequently can expedite work-related diagnosis, prompt treatment, and facilitates compensation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">In this study, data on occupations are mostly available in medical records. However, the depths of information are scarce. Most information is limited to only the current or last job title, with little information on previous jobs, the work activity, exposure at workplace, intensity or duration of exposure that could provide information to possible causes of work-related cancer.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par39">To the authors&#8217; knowledge, this study was the first to investigate the acquisition of occupational data from cancer patients&#8217; medical records in Malaysia. This pioneering effort is crucial in assessing how well attending medical practitioners documented occupational histories. The study provided valuable baseline data on the availability of occupational history, highlighting gaps in collection of information. Understanding these gaps is essential for improving documentation on occupation during patient consultations. Comprehensive occupational details could establish a link between occupation and cancer, which is important for diagnosis, planning and implementation of preventive strategies, and compensation claims.</p><p id="Par40">However, this was a descriptive feasibility study with a small sample size involving two centres in Malaysia. Furthermore, the patient interviews were conducted only at a single site, which was the paper-based oncology centre. Although the findings from the interview component may not be generalizable to other settings and may introduce potential bias, it provided valuable insight into the discrepancies between patient-reported occupational history and the information recorded in medical records, highlighting specific gaps in documentation practices. In addition to that, recall bias may have affected the accuracy of self-reported occupational information, particularly among patients with long work histories or complex employment backgrounds. Moreover, present study did not explore the underlying reasons for gaps in documentation of occupational data or discrepancies between patient interviews and medical records. Hence, additional studies are needed to investigate the reason behind incomplete or inconsistent occupational information in records. Specifically, research focusing on medical practitioners&#8217; practices and factors contributing to these discrepancies would provide deeper insights into improving data collection methods.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par41">A detailed occupational history with information on work description (what kind of work the patient actually did, not just the job title) and exposures (type of chemicals, length of exposure, use of personal protective equipment) are essential to assist in the diagnosis of occupational cancer. Although an acceptable percentage of occupational data was available in both EMR and paper-based systems in this study, the type of information recorded was inconsistent and very brief. Details on specific exposures were often missing, and most records contained only the job title and workplace. Manually entered paper-based systems sometimes offer better data availability. However, there were discrepancies in the data retrieved from medical records with data collected from patients&#8217; interview in this study. This emphasizes the need for standardization in occupational history taking. Health professionals need to be trained to be more equipped with the skills for occupational history taking. This includes improving their knowledge and awareness of occupational cancers and the importance of occupational history taking. Additionally, improving data collection by implementing mandatory fields in electronic records and using a systematic checklist could enhance the accuracy of occupational record keeping, ultimately leading to better diagnosis and management of work-related cancers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
