Pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing may provide clinicians with guidance around medication choice based on a patient&#8217;s drug response-related genetic variants. However, this technology is not routinely used in clinical care in Canada, and the views of key actors in the implementation process are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to qualitatively elicit the perspectives and attitudes of clinicians, scientists, policy actors and members of industry about PGx testing to guide antidepressant prescribing in primary care via interviews to help inform implementation policies for this technology.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>We conducted a qualitative description study. Data analysis proceeded in parallel with data collection and consisted of an inductive qualitative content analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>The focus of this study was implementation of PGx testing in primary care in Ontario, Canada.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>We conducted semistructured interviews with 28 individuals who had professional experience relevant to the implementation of PGx testing for depression care (&#8216;key informants&#8217;). Geographical limits for recruitment were applied based on the transferability of key informants&#8217; expertise to the Ontario setting; included participants worked in Canada, the USA and Europe.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Participants described views about PGx testing relating to benefits and harms of this technology; their interpretation of the evidence base; implementation-oriented considerations and industry involvement. Overall, participants spoke enthusiastically about PGx testing, but emphasised genetic information is only one component of decision-making about medication prescription. Most endorsed implementation in primary care and felt a pre-emptive approach to testing would be ideal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Key informants consider the use of PGx testing to guide antidepressant prescribing in primary care as having both patient-level and system-level benefits. Concerns raised centred primarily around clinician education and barriers to access. Future research should focus on questions relating to feasibility of system-wide implementation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>QUALITATIVE RESEARCH</kwd><kwd>Depression &amp; mood disorders</kwd><kwd>GENETICS</kwd><kwd>Primary Health Care</kwd><kwd>Health policy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ethical Complexity in Primary Care</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Brocher Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>McMaster University Department of Family Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="disclaimer"><p>The funders had no role in the study design;

as well as other cognitive and somatic symptoms that impair normal functioning.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Moderate-to-severe cases of MDD are typically treated with antidepressants<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>; however, less than half of patients respond satisfactorily to the first antidepressant prescribed.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> In Canada, approximately one-quarter of patients seeking depression care in a primary care setting have treatment-resistant depression (TRD) (which may also be referred to as refractory depression), defined as trialling at least two antidepressants in alignment with clinical guidelines without experiencing improvement.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Furthermore, approximately two-thirds of patients using antidepressants experience at least one side effect from medication, with reduced libido, weight gain, xerostomia or dry mouth and nausea being the most prevalent side effects reported.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5 6</sup></xref></p><p>It is increasingly understood that genetics contribute to the effects individuals experience from pharmaceutical treatments including antidepressants,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7 8</sup></xref> with 42% of individual differences in response attributable to common genetic variants.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> As knowledge of the impact of genetic factors on drug response has grown, genetic tests to determine whether a person possesses any drug response-related variants have been developed. These pharmacogenomic (PGx) tests are becoming increasingly available in clinical settings for patients who can afford to pay privately.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> PGx testing is intended to enable healthcare providers (HCPs) to prescribe antidepressants in a more targeted fashion, ultimately helping facilitate faster patient access to a drug that is effective and tolerable. Depression or anxiety is the sixth most common reason for presenting to primary care<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and approximately two-thirds of antidepressants are prescribed in a primary care setting.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12 13</sup></xref> Thus, this sector of the health system is an important location for the offer and implementation of PGx testing.</p><p>Despite the commercial availability of PGx tests, this technology has not been widely implemented as a routine component of depression care, though there have been several studies reporting on specific PGx programmes or studies launched (not necessarily with a psychiatric focus) primarily in the USA and the Netherlands.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Canadian clinical practice guidelines do not currently recommend routine use of PGx testing on the basis of modest and inconsistent clinical benefit.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> However, guidelines suggest that there are several situations in which PGx testing may be helpful, namely when patients experience severe or unusual adverse events even at low doses of a medication, or when they do not seem to be responding to even a therapeutic dose of a particular drug.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> While there have been attempts to clinically implement PGx testing in Canada,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> PGx testing remains primarily accessible through participation in research. Implementation efforts are ongoing, and as they continue, those who participate in professional activities that influence the design or delivery of PGx testing must carefully contemplate a number of clinical, ethical, social, legal, economic and practical considerations to ensure formally embedding PGx testing in the healthcare system is done effectively and ethically. Barriers to implementation of PGx testing in the mental healthcare setting that have been previously identified include the cost of testing, an uncertain evidence base, challenges incorporating testing into current clinician workflows and lack of clear guidelines about using PGx testing in psychiatry.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> It has also been recognised that the influence of lifestyle, environmental factors and social determinants of health on mental health, independent from medications, hinders the ability to generalise existing evidence about the clinical utility of PGx testing.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> Additionally, challenges related to the ethics and equity of this technology have been identified. For example, PGx tests may have variable sensitivity and specificity depending on the geographical ancestry of the person being tested. Most of the research done to develop these tests was conducted on participants with a white European background, so PGx panels may not include variants that are comparatively rare in those of European descent but common in other groups.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> There are also questions around privacy, as many PGx tests are commercially developed and accessed directly from genetic testing companies governed only by their own privacy policies. The private-pay nature of this technology creates equity of access issues: in Canada, PGx testing is not publicly funded and only available to those who can pay the commercial price of approximately CAD200 to over CAD2000.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p><p>The views of key actors can help inform the shape implementation of PGx testing to guide antidepressant prescribing will take. Beyond highlighting barriers, their perspectives can also contribute to identifying strategies or approaches to circumvent the wide range of existing challenges through thoughtful design. Moreover, understanding these perspectives may elucidate specific evidence gaps that need to be filled, as well as ethical or systems considerations that need attention prior to implementation. However, little is known about the perspectives and preferences of these key actors, particularly in the context of Canada&#8217;s public healthcare system. There have been some studies examining clinician perspectives on PGx testing,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> with some including policy-makers, members of hospital leadership teams, researchers and experts in fields such as epidemiology or public health alongside clinicians.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> However, only a handful of these were conducted in jurisdictions with public healthcare systems<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45 53 56 57</sup></xref> and few focused on PGx testing for depression.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50 51 55 58</sup></xref> Our objective was, therefore, to fill this knowledge gap through a qualitative description study of the perspectives and preferences of key informants with knowledge relevant to the implementation of PGx testing for antidepressant prescription in Ontario, Canada, which is one of the country&#8217;s main hubs for PGx testing research,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48 59 60</sup></xref> to help inform implementation policies for this technology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is reported according to the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr"><sup>61</sup></xref> (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S1</xref>).

We considered these participants &#8216;key informants&#8217;: individuals knowledgeable about PGx testing itself, the healthcare context in which the technology would be integrated, or the policy process that governs implementation, and who would be able to draw on their professional experiences to &#8216;provide high level perspectives and comparative insights&#8217;<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr"><sup>64</sup></xref> about the technology. We defined four categories of key informants based on how they would encounter PGx testing in their professional capacities. Potentially eligible participants included: (1) clinicians (ie, regulated HCPs who encounter PGx testing as part of their clinical work, including physicians, genetic counsellors, pharmacists, nurses, psychologists or other health and social care professionals); (2) scientists (ie, clinical or health services researchers who study PGx testing); (3) members of the policy process or &#8216;policy actors&#8217;<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr"><sup>65</sup></xref> (ie, individuals involved in decision-making for PGx testing to guide antidepressant prescribing in Ontario, including scientists who produce evidence to inform policy decisions, members of advisory committees that make policy recommendations to the government and government officials responsible for making final policy decisions) and (4) members of industry (ie, industry employees or organisational staff involved in the research, development, validation or sales of PGx testing to guide antidepressant prescribing, as well as any clinicians employed by commercial organisations selling PGx testing). We sought to include a wide array of key informants who would have unique perspectives on this technology as a result of their different roles, experiences and sets of expertise. This diversity ultimately enabled us to better understand the breadth of implications that PGx testing implementation in the context of depression may have on patient care and the healthcare system as a whole.</p><p>Some eligible individuals belonged to multiple key informant categories (eg, clinician-scientists; clinicians, scientists and clinician-scientists who also act in some capacity as policy actors). All individuals who consented to participating were asked to describe their role(s), as well as to identify the primary way in which they engage with PGx testing to guide antidepressant prescribing. Participants with multiple roles were encouraged to draw on all of their relevant expertise throughout their interview.</p><p>Consumers of this technology (ie, patients) were not considered key informants, unless they also played a role in health system decision-making, for instance, as patient partners working with an organisation such as the Ontario Ministry of Health. Eligible participants needed to be comfortable completing an interview in English. While the study focused on Ontario, geographical limits were applied differently depending on the nature of the key informant&#8217;s role and expertise. Members of the policy process held roles within Ontario while those with expertise relevant to (for example) ethics or industry development may have contributed from outside the province.</p><p>Purposive sampling<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr"><sup>66</sup></xref> was the main approach used to recruit participants. We identified a range of areas of expertise we considered important to capture (eg, knowledge of ethical, social and legal implications of PGx testing; intricacies of PGx test development; etc) and used publicly available sources including peer-reviewed published literature, grey literature and the websites of government groups, advisory bodies and other relevant institutions to identify potential participants with demonstrated knowledge in those areas. In creating this list, we prioritised individuals who had first-hand experience with PGx test implementation in clinical care, or with established independent research programmes related to PGx testing or genetics in primary care, paying particular attention to first or senior authors on peer-reviewed literature on this topic. We also prioritised individuals in senior positions within academic or government organisations, such as the directors of large-scale, hospital-led PGx research programmes, or chairs of scientific advisory committees or policy development working groups who were currently examining, or had in the past 5 years examined, PGx testing to guide antidepressant prescribing.</p><p>Additionally, we engaged in chain referral (snowball) sampling whereby we asked key informants who consented to participate to identify others who may be interested in taking part who may not have been known to us or who were otherwise hard to reach. When making recommendations, some key informants explained they were highlighting specific individuals they believed would have perspectives divergent from their own to ensure we would capture a wide range of attitudes and beliefs. Chain referral was the primary way we identified members of industry who may have been eligible and receptive to participating. We also used participants&#8217; recommendations to further refine our list of potentially eligible key informants to contact by focusing on those individuals who were repeatedly highlighted as experts in this area who would contribute important perspectives. In some cases, potentially eligible individuals approached us, having received information about this study from one of their colleagues. We invited these individuals to participate if we felt they had expertise not already well-represented in our data.</p><p>Finally, we identified members of our personal or professional networks whose professional interests and expertise were known to us and who we therefore believed could be eligible to participate, or who could recommend potentially eligible individuals.</p><p>Decisions about how many participants to approach for each category of key informant were made on the basis of data saturation within groups (ie, data from participants belonging to the same category of key informant began to be repetitive).<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr"><sup>67</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Data collection</title><p>Participants completed a semistructured interview between November 2023 and March 2024. The majority of participants were interviewed individually. However, some participants were members of the same team whose areas of expertise with respect to PGx testing were different but complementary and requested to be interviewed together as they would be speaking to the same body of professional work. A female researcher (AC) conducted all interviews and wrote a memo following each one. Four interview guides were developed, all containing questions about the same high-level topics but with specific questions tailored to each relevant professional role (clinician, scientist, policy actor, member of industry) (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental tables S2&#8211;S5</xref>). We decided which interview guide to use for each interview based on how participants self-identified the primary way in which they encounter PGx testing.

<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr"><sup>68</sup></xref> and were refined as analysis proceeded.

In line with this theory, we anticipated a relatively small sample size given that the study aim was narrow, the combination of participants was specific to the study aim, and the interview dialogue was clear and rich. However, this study was not underpinned by a specific theory, and as we proceeded, we observed consistency among participants&#8217; perspectives, prompting us to continue recruitment as lack of theory and homogeneity in data indicate lower information power and necessitate a larger sample size.<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr"><sup>71</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analysis occurred in parallel with data collection.

A minority of participants described privacy concerns or mentioned the need for data security. No consistent pattern of roles or designations was marked in either group. Nearly all participants raised the issue that PGx panels are largely based on data from populations of European ancestry; some participants described the potential for inequitable health outcomes as a result of this as a potential harm.</p><p>Throughout their interviews, participants either implicitly or explicitly described ways these harms may be mitigated.

They also endorsed the use of tests that include variants known to be common in populations not of European ancestry to address potential inequities in health outcomes. Lastly, a small number described using commercial laboratories to conduct testing but re-interpreting results in-house.</p><p>Finally, we asked some participants to comment on the potential for secondary findings from PGx testing, described in this study as variants relevant to drug metabolism that are also associated with risk of disease. Some stated this was not something they had encountered or explained it was something they did not consider a real possibility given the specific variants typically interrogated through this testing. Others explained they were not aware of any secondary findings related to the genes most implicated in the metabolism of antidepressants specifically, but that there are known secondary findings related to PGx genes associated with other types of medications. Some pointed out that genetics knowledge is still evolving, so common PGx variants involved in antidepressant metabolism may 1&#8201;day be determined to also indicate disease risk, but they had varying levels of concern about this. When this point was raised, participants typically emphasised the importance of clearly communicating to patients that the evidence in this field is still emerging and our understanding of the implications of genetic variants may change over time. A few participants expressed worry about the identification of non-PGx, disease-related variants because these are included in some commercially available PGx tests. Several participants mentioned that some PGx variants relevant to antidepressant prescribing may also be involved in the metabolism of other types of medications, and sometimes thought of these types of variants as secondary findings. They typically described this as one of the benefits of deploying PGx testing in primary care specifically since family physicians prescribe a wide range of drugs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Interpretation of the evidence base</title><p>A handful of participants across all four key informant groups addressed the state of the evidence about PGx testing. Most, including scientists, policy actors and a clinician, felt that the clinical effectiveness evidence around PGx testing remains unclear or equivocal, at least in some areas. For example, one participant stated that for <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;remission it works, definitely. &#8216;Hospitalization, little bit, it&#8217;s not so evident&#8221; (SCI03</italic>), and another felt that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;there are certain drug-gene pairs that there is a greater amount of evidence for than others&#8221; (SCI11</italic>). It is worth noting that the policy actors we interviewed had all been involved in a formal evaluation of PGx technologies several years prior and were speaking to the clinical evidence they had reviewed at that time. A minority of participants, including scientists and a member of industry, felt that PGx testing is well-supported by the clinical effectiveness evidence. The majority of participants who discussed the cost-effectiveness of PGx testing felt that the economic evidence clearly supports the widespread use of this technology. Two participants referenced a past evaluation of PGx testing for depression care conducted by an Ontario provincial health agency and felt that Ontario should review the economics associated with this testing in light of new evidence.</p><p>When asked about specific evidence gaps, the majority of participants pointed to a need for more research about relevant PGx alleles and utility of PGx testing in populations not of European ancestry, and several discussed the need for research that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;really digs into and systematically explores how to implement at a provincial health system level. That&#8217;s big, that&#8217;s not just at one research centre or one study. There seems to be very little evidence on how to do this at scale and across a big population&#8221; (SCI05</italic>). When asked directly, participants uniformly stated that it was reasonable to proceed with diffusion of this technology given the current landscape of research evidence, provided patients were informed about the limitations that currently exist to both the technology and evidence about the technology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implementation-oriented considerations</title><p>Implementation-oriented considerations included perspectives about the clinical care context in which PGx testing would be deployed; cost and funding considerations; and supports, resources and infrastructure required for successful implementation.</p><sec id="s3-3-1"><title>Clinical care context</title><p>Participants discussed an array of considerations and preferences for how PGx testing should be implemented in the healthcare system, including the appropriate point in the care pathway to offer PGx testing, deployment of PGx testing in primary care and optimal roles for different types of clinicians.</p><p>Most who commented on the ideal testing pathway endorsed pre-emptive testing at some point before being prescribed or taking either antidepressants or any other medication in general. A small number felt that PGx testing should be incorporated into newborn screening programmes or be performed sometime in childhood. The view favouring pre-emptive testing was expressed even by some of the key informants who felt that the evidence base around the clinical effectiveness of PGx testing is still somewhat unclear. However, most endorsing this approach recognised that wide pre-emptive testing would not be feasible, and that realistically PGx testing is more likely to be used reactively after someone has tried one or more medications. They described a reactive approach as more realistic both because it would be less costly from a health system perspective, but also because existing evidence primarily supports use of PGx testing in this patient population. One ethicist was the primary dissenting voice.</p><p>When asked about the deployment of PGx testing in primary care specifically, the majority of participants considered there to be several benefits to using this technology in this clinical care setting. Primary care providers see the greatest proportion of depression cases, and PGx testing could give primary care providers guidance about medication choice and confidence to prescribe a medication they may not usually turn to. A small number of drawbacks of implementing PGx testing in primary care were also discussed. The main concern was that primary care providers may not have the necessary education or training to use or interpret this testing appropriately, as <italic toggle="yes">&#8216;primary care practitioners are not yet experts in interpreting the results of genetic testing&#8217; (POL01)</italic>. Some participants also acknowledged that primary care providers already spend a lot of time doing unpaid labour related to patient care and that physicians are <italic toggle="yes">&#8216;all strapped&#8217; (SCI05)</italic>, so implementation of PGx testing in the primary care setting would represent additional work that these clinicians may not have the capacity for.</p><p>When asked to consider the types of clinicians that should be involved in PGx testing aside from family physicians, approximately half of participants expressed that pharmacists play a crucial role. A small number of participants mentioned genetic counsellors and felt that they should be involved. These participants were scientists, policy actors and clinicians, including one who was not trained as a genetic counsellor. Three participants felt that only people who are able to prescribe medications should be able to order PGx testing. Several participants described a need for a <italic toggle="yes">&#8216;multidisciplinary approach&#8217; (SCI09)</italic> calling for collaboration and coordination between a variety of different types of clinicians including primary care physicians, psychiatrists, pharmacists and genetic counsellors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-2"><title>Cost and funding considerations</title><p>Approximately half of the key informants interviewed commented on the cost of PGx testing, often describing it as a barrier to patients accessing this technology. However, clinicians expressed that they would discuss this technology with all patients whom they felt would benefit regardless of their perception of that patient&#8217;s ability to pay. These clinicians typically defined &#8216;patients who would benefit&#8217; as those who had already tried at least one or two antidepressants without success.</p><p>Several participants indicated they would like this technology to be publicly funded, that they view PGx testing as a high priority for coverage, or that there needs to be some reimbursement to facilitate ease and equity of access. Some participants also discussed costs to the healthcare system. They acknowledged that implementation would be a big upfront expense, but stated PGx testing would ultimately yield cost savings, enabling us to redistribute some of our resources: <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve also got to just recognize the reality of savings in this space is not necessarily like lower expenditure, it&#8217;s about actually releasing resources for use by others. So when we&#8217;re talking about reduced hospitalisations, that doesn&#8217;t mean that wards are closing and that the health system spends less money, it means that those resources are available for others&#8221; (SCI06</italic>).</p><p>Lastly, some considered the ethical implications of publicly funding PGx testing in the absence of robust public drug coverage. Some felt it may be problematic to direct individuals to medications they may not be able to afford, but overall participants either did not consider this a big problem, or viewed it as aligned with other funding decisions within Canadian healthcare.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-3"><title>Necessary supports, resources and infrastructure</title><p>We asked participants to describe the supports, resources and infrastructure they believed would be necessary for the successful implementation of PGx testing. Many highlighted the need for clinician education, as well as some form of support for clinicians to correctly interpret PGx findings. For example, one participant suggested it may be helpful to have a <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;dedicated clinical pharmacologist that helps to write the actual recommendations that go into clinical decision support&#8221; (SCI05). Another suggested that, &#8220;maybe they need genetic counsellors as a liaison in between the company and themselves, for making sense of the report&#8221; (SCI01</italic>). Most also described a need for advancements in information technology systems. Specifically, participants felt there needed to be seamless integration of PGx testing results into the electronic medical record (EMR) and described the importance of centralisation such that a patient&#8217;s PGx information could be accessible to any physician providing care in any setting.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Involvement of industry</title><p>Over the course of their interviews, a handful of participants, including members from all four key informant categories, discussed the role of industry with respect to PGx testing. Most who touched on this held roles as clinicians, scientists or policy actors and expressed that industry involvement in healthcare is essential to innovation and that, in terms of scientific advisory committees and governmental decision-making, there are appropriate mechanisms in place to address conflicts of interest that may arise. A small number of participants were asked whether it may be possible for PGx testing companies to influence results such that particular medications would be recommended more frequently, and respondents generally felt this was unlikely, or stated they did not know or did not have any evidence to suggest this was occurring.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This qualitative description study examined the perspectives and preferences of 28 clinicians, scientists, policy actors and members of industry with respect to PGx testing to guide antidepressant prescribing. Participants were enthusiastic about the use of this technology, citing its potential to help patients with depression achieve response or remission faster. They identified several benefits of implementation in primary care, including that most depression cases are managed in primary care and PGx testing for depression may also provide guidance around other medications that these providers typically prescribe. However, key informants cautioned that this testing is not a panacea and emphasised the importance of managing patients&#8217; expectations. Moreover, they recognised primary care physicians may not have the necessary education or training to appropriately interpret PGx test results and advocated the involvement of pharmacists in the testing process. Key informants noted that many PGx panels may be founded on genetic information from European populations and highlighted the need for more research to support PGx testing for patients of different geographical ancestries. Finally, many participants noted the need for integration of PGx information within EMRs so that all of a patient&#8217;s health information would be stored in one location, as well as the need for centralised health records so that a patient&#8217;s PGx test results can be accessible to any physician at any time in any care setting.</p><p>These findings are in line with previous studies examining the perspectives of clinicians, policy-makers, health insurers and laboratory experts<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50 58</sup></xref> who also described the therapeutic benefits of PGx testing as relating to its potential to facilitate faster recovery with fewer side effects and reduced trial-and-error; considered this technology as providing additional information to be integrated with other factors that impact clinical decision-making about antidepressants; and commented on the need for clinician education and technological support. Similar to past work in which participants expressed desire for more clinical evidence supporting the use of PGx testing in psychiatric care,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50 58</sup></xref> several participants in the present study felt the clinical evidence underpinning this technology does not offer clear confirmation that PGx-guided treatment is superior to unguided treatment across all relevant outcome measures. However, the key informants we interviewed largely agreed that past calls for conclusive economic evidence about PGx testing to guide antidepressant prescribing<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr"><sup>58</sup></xref> have now been answered, with a recent cost-effectiveness analysis finding that implementation of this technology for patients with moderate-severe depression in one Canadian province would result in cost-savings to the provincial health system of US$956&#8201;million over the course of 20 years.<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr"><sup>76</sup></xref> In light of this, some participants explicitly suggested that Ontario policy actors revisit the evidence base that provides the foundation for funding recommendations made by scientific advisory groups to the provincial Ministry of Health. Inclusion of this technology in the basket of publicly funded healthcare services would address equity of access issues resulting from the cost of commercial testing, which was also a concern raised by many key informants.</p><p>Previous studies have also touched on the question of who should be offered PGx testing. Some have found that clinicians generally consider patients who had already tried medications without relief or who were hesitant to take medication to treat their depression as being most likely to benefit from PGx testing.<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr"><sup>77</sup></xref> Others described key informants as being split, with one group believing PGx testing is best undertaken before a patient trials their first antidepressant and another group believing this technology should be limited to subgroups of depression patients such as those with TRD for reasons related to clinical utility, cost-effectiveness or resource allocation.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr"><sup>58</sup></xref> In contrast, many of the participants in this study endorsed pre-emptive testing, typically prior to the initiation of an antidepressant or other medication, with a small number suggesting that PGx testing be performed as part of newborn screening or in childhood. Pre-emptive testing early in life and without a specific indication would create ethical difficulty because, although secondary findings may not be a concern with respect to the main genes typically implicated in antidepressant metabolism or recommended for inclusion as part of a minimal psychiatric PGx panel,<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref><xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref> they are possible from other genes with known PGx associations.<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr"><sup>83</sup></xref> Additional secondary findings may also be discovered in the future. Ethics literature has described concerns about autonomy, as well as privacy, and has put forth that children&#8217;s &#8216;right not to know&#8217; is an important consideration when considering genetic testing in minors, particularly when there are no therapeutic or preventative measures available related to the genetic information uncovered.<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr"><sup>84</sup></xref> That said, the level of risk and the magnitude of potential infringements depend on how PGx testing would be undertaken, with a small, targeted panel designed in strict accordance with guidelines published by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr"><sup>85</sup></xref> and run by in-house laboratories at medical centres, arguably posing less risk. The preference for testing early in life and without a specific indication expressed by a small number of participants in the study sample signals there may be a need for continued analysis of ethical and social issues related to PGx testing.</p><p>While participants were clear about their perspectives on and preferences for PGx test implementation, they felt there is a need for more evidence about how to effectively integrate this technology into clinician workflows across a health system. However, there was some consensus that primary care providers need additional training about PGx and would benefit from having clinical decision supports in place such as access to clinicians with PGx expertise who were available to aid in the interpretation of genetic test results. There was also some consensus about the characteristics of a &#8216;good&#8217; PGx test, specifically that it only includes variants or makes recommendations about medications for which there are CPIC<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr"><sup>85</sup></xref> or Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy&#8211;Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr"><sup>86</sup></xref> clinical guidelines, includes variants common in non-white populations, and does not make PGx recommendations through an opaque, proprietary (&#8216;black-box&#8217;) algorithm. These suggestions were aligned with published literature offering guidance about how to choose a PGx test.<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr"><sup>87</sup></xref></p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the use of antidepressants has markedly increased over time. For example, in Canada, the prevalence of antidepressant prescribing in primary care increased from 9.2% in 2006 to 12.8% in 2012,<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr"><sup>88</sup></xref> while in the UK the number of antidepressant prescriptions tripled between 1998 and 2018.<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr"><sup>89</sup></xref> While patients with depression have previously expressed concerns that PGx testing may lead to more emphasis on pharmacotherapy and potentially de-prioritise other forms of treatment,<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr"><sup>90</sup></xref> key informants have emphasised that this testing is only one component of the decision-making process about antidepressant prescribing. Furthermore, the observed increases in antidepressant prescribing over time appear to be primarily the result of increasing numbers of patients prescribed antidepressants as long-term treatment (ie, for at least 2 years) or who have recurrent depression.<xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr"><sup>91</sup></xref> Regardless of whether PGx testing is used to help guide antidepressant choice, clinicians should continue to incorporate multiple patient and medication factors when making prescription decisions, and should also consider if and when deprescription may be appropriate.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>While this study included the perspectives and preferences of clinicians, scientists, policy actors and members of industry with a diverse expertise relating to PGx testing, the views of government officials who would be directly involved in making an ultimate funding decision about this technology are not represented due to recruitment challenges with this group. In addition to this, the majority of key informants who identified primarily as clinicians (six pharmacists, five family physicians, three genetic counsellors and two psychiatrists) had received formal training around PGx testing or were familiar with the literature as a result of secondary roles as scientists or policy actors. However, if implemented in primary care, clinicians implementing this technology are more likely to be familiar with PGx testing only through independent learning. While five family physicians participated, future research should seek to understand specific education and resource needs of community primary care physicians who may not have the same exposures to formal training about this technology.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Clinicians, scientists, policy actors and members of industry with professional experiences with and expertise about PGx testing to guide antidepressant prescribing consider the use of this technology in primary care as having both patient-level and system-level benefits. Concerns raised centred primarily around clinician education and barriers to access. Future research should focus on questions relating to feasibility, particularly for system-wide implementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-091562</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s001.docx" id="d67e920" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP2" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-091562</object-id><label>online supplemental file 2</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s002.docx" id="d67e925" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP3" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-091562</object-id><label>online supplemental file 3</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s003.docx" id="d67e930" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>AC is supported by a Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, by the Department of Family Medicine at McMaster University, and by the Brocher Foundation.
