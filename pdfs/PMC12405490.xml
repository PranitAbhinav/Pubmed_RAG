However, the intricate link between ferroptosis and oncogenic mutations remains unclear. Here we show that SMARCA4, a well-established tumour suppressor whose deficiency is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to treatments, sensitizes non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells to ferroptosis. Mechanistically, SMARCA4 promotes chromatin accessibility and expression of ALDH16A1. Surprisingly, ALDH16A1 lacks ALDH enzymatic activity, but binds to the anti-ferroptotic oxidoreductase thioredoxin (TXN), facilitating its translocation to the lysosome and subsequent degradation. Meanwhile, ALDH16A1 directly inhibits TXN&#8217;s oxidoreductase function by occluding its active site. We also show that either restoring ALDH16A1 levels or inhibiting TXN significantly enhances the effectiveness of chemo/immunotherapy in a ferroptosis-dependent manner in SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC. Collectively, our findings elucidate an intricate SMARCA4-ALDH16A1-TXN stability/function dual regulatory axis that governs ferroptosis and informs a therapeutic strategy for overcoming resistance to chemotherapy or immunotherapy in SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">SMARCA4 deficiency is associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The delicate balance between ferroptosis-inducing activities and intracellular defence systems, primarily consisting of the SLC7A11/GPX4-dependent glutathione (GSH) system, FSP1- and DHODH-dependent ubiquinol system, and GCH1-dependent tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) system, is crucial for maintaining this equilibrium. These anti-ferroptotic systems detoxify lipid peroxides, preventing membrane rupture and ferroptotic cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, when the pro-ferroptotic forces overwhelm the anti-ferroptotic mechanisms, often due to genetic or pharmacological perturbations in an iron-rich environment, excess hydrogen peroxide reacts with iron in a Fenton reaction, generating highly reactive hydroxyl radicals that attack the bis-allylic moieties of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids located on plasma membrane or membrane organelles, ultimately leading to ferroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In recent years, there has been a surge in interest in harnessing ferroptosis as a therapeutic strategy against cancer. Studies have shown that various anti-cancer approaches, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy, can trigger ferroptosis, suggesting its potential to enhance the efficacy of existing cancer therapies and overcome resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Notably, specific genetic alterations, such as loss-of-function mutations in TP53 and KEAP1, commonly observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), can confer sensitivity or resistance to ferroptosis, with important therapeutic implications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Motivated by these findings, we investigate the role of other tumour suppressors in ferroptosis regulation and the underlying mechanisms. SMARCA4, the ATPase, a key subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex, is a recognized tumour suppressor due to its roles in cell fate specification and DNA repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Its deficiency, observed in approximately 8% of NSCLC patients, is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to conventional chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Through a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen in NSCLC cell lines, we discover that SMARCA4 knockout significantly protects tumour cells from ferroptotic cell death.</p><p id="Par6">Our further investigation reveals that SMARCA4 promotes chromatin accessibility and enhances the expression of ALDH16A1, an uncharacterized &#8220;cargo adaptor&#8221; that transports thioredoxin, an anti-ferroptotic oxidoreductase, to lysosomes for degradation, thereby promoting ferroptosis. We also propose that this mechanism can be leveraged to improve SMARCA4-deficiency NSCLC&#8217;s response to immunotherapy.</p><p id="Par7">In this work, we uncover a critical mechanism by which SMARCA4 deficiency enables NSCLC cells to evade ferroptosis, thereby rationalizing the targeting of the SMARCA4/ALDH16A1/TXN/ferroptosis axis as a promising therapeutic approach for patients with SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>SMARCA4 promotes ferroptosis in NSCLC cells</title><p id="Par8">Tumour suppressor loss in cancer cells can confer ferroptotic resistance or vulnerability, making them potential therapeutic targets. To identify ferroptosis-related tumour suppressors, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen in human NSCLC cell line PC9. To achieve this, the cells were transduced with a CRISPR library encompassing 19,060 genes, with a total of 114,155 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (six per gene), followed by a two-day selection using the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 as a ferroptosis inducer (FIN) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). sgRNAs targeting known ferroptosis drivers, such as ACSL4 and RETSAT, were enriched in cells surviving RSL3 treatment, whereas anti-ferroptosis genes DHODH, FSP1 and SLC7A11 were depleted (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

Notably, SMARCA4, encoding the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF complex and a frequently mutated tumour suppressor in NSCLC, was identified as a potential pro-ferroptosis gene. To systematically investigate SMARCA4 role in ferroptosis regulation, we selected five NSCLC cell lines commonly used in ferroptosis-related studies and confirmed their SMARCA4 status as indicated in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. These included three wild-type (WT) lines (PC9, H1975 and HCC827) and two with SMARCA4 deficiencies (A549 with a frame-shift deletion, H23 with a missense mutation). SMARCA4 expression or deficiency was verified by western blot (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of SMARCA4 in the WT cells significantly inhibited ferroptosis induced by RSL3 and IKE, another key FIN targeting SLC7A11 (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, e</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a, b</xref>). Colony formation assays also demonstrated consistent results, demonstrating a stable phenotype (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1c</xref>). Conversely, ectopic restoration of intact SMARCA4, but not its ATPase-dead mutant (K785R), sensitized A549 and H23 cells to FINs, suggesting ATPase activity is crucial for SMARCA4 regulatory role in ferroptosis (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f, g</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1d, e</xref>). The increased cell death was abolished by ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and deferoxamine (DFO), but not by apoptosis (z-VAD(OMe)-FMC) or necroptosis (necrosulfonamide) inhibitors, confirming SMARCA4 specific role in ferroptosis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). Comparable results were observed with other FINs, including GPX4 inhibitor ML210 and class 3 FIN56 that inhibits both GPX and CoQ pathway (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1f</xref>). Additionally, SMARCA4 depletion in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 and colon cancer HCT116 cells, both of which possess WT SMARCA4, promoted resistance to RSL3-induced cell death, indicating this property is not limited to NSCLC (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1g, h</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">Phospholipid peroxidation, a hallmark of ferroptosis, was assessed using BODIPY-C11 staining. SMARCA4 knockout significantly reduced RSL3-induced lipid peroxidation in PC9, while its restoration had opposite effects in A549 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>). Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed that A549 cells treated with RSL3 exhibited reduced numbers of mitochondrial cristae with increased membrane density, another characteristic morphologic ferroptosis feature and this effect was markedly amplified in SMARCA4-restored cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Organoid refers to the self-organized 3D tissue that is typically derived from stem cells or cancer cells, and which mimics the key functional, structural and biological complexity of the original organs. Compared to 2D cultures and animal models, patient-derived organoid (PDO) cultures offer patient specificity while recapitulating in vivo tissue structures and functions, thus providing an ideal platform for anti-cancer drug discovery and signalling transduction analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

We tested the ferroptosis-inducing effects of three types of TXN system antagonists acting on different targets at varying doses. When treating cells with relatively subtoxic doses of TXN antagonists that did not compromise cell viability, cells became significantly more sensitive to subsequent RSL3 or IKE treatment, whereas higher doses of TXN antagonists directly induced cell death, which could be partially reversed by ferroptosis inhibitors DFO and Fer-1, suggesting ferroptosis involvement (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref>). Among the three antagonists, we chose auranofin for subsequent TXN-related experiments due to its optimal ferroptosis-inducing and sensitizing effects.

Using a thioredoxin fluorometric assay and western blot, we found that ALDH16A1 knockout significantly increased TXN enzymatic activity and protein levels in NSCLC cell lines, whereas its restoration had the opposite effect (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h, i</xref>). Consistently, upstream SMARCA4 depletion had a similar impact on TXN expression, but ALDH16A1 knockout abrogated this effect (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4j</xref>). Besides, in the cell lines used in the present study, the protein levels of ALDH16A1 were relatively lower in SMARCA4<sup>def</sup> A549 and H23 in comparison with SMARCA4<sup>wt</sup> PC9 and H1975, while TXN exhibited opposite results (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4c</xref>).

Analysis of the ALDH16A1 amino acid sequence uncovered the presence of a canonical KFERQ-like motif (609&#8211;613aa, RLERQ), suggesting the potential involvement of endosomal microautophagy or chaperone-mediated autophagy process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

To ascertain whether ALDH16A1 utilizes the KFERQ motif to shuttle TXN to lysosomes, we restored the ALDH16A1 variant lacking the 609&#8211;613 region (ALDH16A1<sup>&#916;609&#8211;613</sup>) in ALDH16A1-KO cells. We found that this KFERQ-deficient ALDH16A1 failed to destabilize TXN protein or enhance the colocalization of TXN with the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, d</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5c</xref>).

The resulting model revealed that TXN is embedded between the two ALDH domains of ALDH16A1, suggesting that both the N- and C-terminal domains, despite lacking canonical ALDH activity, play a role in the interaction with TXN (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). To substantiate this prediction, we cloned the two domains (N-terminal, 1&#8211;494 aa; C-terminal, 525&#8211;802 aa) into plasmids and transduced them into HEK-293T cells expressing HA-TXN. Additionally, a plasmid containing full-length ALDH16A1 served as a positive control. As anticipated, Co-IP experiments demonstrated that neither of the isolated ALDH16A1 domains could bind to TXN alone (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>). Consistent with these structural findings, we observed that restoring either of the two domains in ALDH16A1-KO PC9 and A549 cells failed to mimic the full-length ALDH16A1 ability to promote ferroptosis or TXN&#8217;s lysosomal transport and degradation (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h, i</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5e&#8211;g</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">Based on the AlphaFold2-predicted ALDH16A1-TXN structure, we further identified three potential interaction sites between the two proteins (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). Two of these sites are located on the C-terminal region (ALDH16A1<sup>PRO567</sup>-TXN<sup>ASP61</sup> and ALDH16A1<sup>GLN737</sup>-TXN<sup>TRP31</sup>), while the third is on the N-terminal region (ALDH16A1<sup>PRO389</sup>-TXN<sup>GLY91/SER90</sup>). Separately deleting one of the three binding sites in ALDH16A1 sequence to different extents, while simultaneous depletion of all of them completely, impaired ALDH16A1&#8217;s pro-ferroptotic property and interaction with TXN (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j, k</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5h, i</xref>). Moreover, these ALDH16A1 mutants failed to promote TXN&#8217;s lysosomal translocation and suppress its protein levels as full-length ALDH16A1 did (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5l</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5j, k</xref>). These results indicate that the three binding sites, distributed across the two ALDH domains of ALDH16A1, mediate its regulatory effects on TXN.</p><p id="Par27">It is noteworthy that when lysosomal function was inhibited with CQ, although ALDH16A1 impact on TXN protein levels was abrogated, the cells&#8217; sensitivity to FINs remained altered by ALDH16A1 modulation (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5m</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5l</xref>). This suggests the existence of mechanisms beyond the ALDH16A1/TXN-lysosomal degradation pathway. Notably, we found that TXN activity was still modulated by ALDH16A1 depletion or restoration, even in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors, indicating that ALDH16A1 may directly block TXN&#8217;s function as an oxidoreductase (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5n</xref>). Previous studies have identified the evolutionary conserved C-G-P-C motif between Cys32 and Cys35 as the catalytic centre of TXN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. According to the ALDH16A1-TXN binding model predicted by AlphaFold2, when ALDH16A1 and TXN interact, the active site Cys32-Cys35 is spatially positioned within the binding interface of the two proteins (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). This suggests that ALDH16A1 may block TXN&#8217;s active site, preventing it from interacting with other TXN system components like TXNR, peroxidases and NADPH, thereby impairing TXN&#8217;s normal function. In summary, ALDH16A1 sensitizes cells to ferroptosis through its interaction with TXN, not only by promoting TXN&#8217;s lysosomal degradation but also by directly impairing its oxidoreductase activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>The SMARCA4/ALDH16A1/TXN pathway enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy</title><p id="Par28">Our team has revealed an important role of ferroptosis in combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP)/pemetrexed (PEM) induced cell death, that CDDP/PEM triggers ferroptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells and altering cells&#8217; response to ferroptosis would be a promising strategy to overcome chemoresistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. These evidences prompt us to examine whether SMARCA4/ALDH16A1/TXN pathway&#8217;s pro-ferroptotic effect is also involved in this process. As expected, depletion of either SMARCA4 or ALDH16A1 significantly desensitized cells to CDDP/PEM treatment, while TXN inhibitor generated opposite effect (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6a</xref>). Besides, recent studies have unveiled the crucial role of ferroptosis in cancer immunology and immunotherapy.

Given the aforementioned ferroptosis-sensitizing function of the SMARCA4/ALDH16A1/TXN pathway, we postulated that tumour cells with SMARCA4 deficiency or ALDH16A1 inhibition would exhibit greater resistance to CD8+ T cell-mediated killing. To validate this hypothesis, we accessed publicly available data from 56 melanoma patients who underwent tumour biopsy and RNA-sequencing during anti-CTLA4/anti-PD1-based therapy (<ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE91061">GSE91061</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The data revealed that sensitivity to immunotherapy is associated with higher ALDH16A1 expression, which is consistent with our in vitro an in vivo result (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6b</xref>). We further categorized these patients into high/low ALDH16A1 expression groups and observed that 7 out of 14 (50%) patients with high ALDH16A1 expression were responsive to ICBs, compared to only 6 out of 42 (14.3%) in the low-ALDH16A1 group (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). This observation primarily implies that relatively higher ALDH16A1 expression confers greater benefits to cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy.

Intriguingly, abnormal activation of oncogenes or silencing of tumour suppressors remodels cancer cells&#8217; metabolic networks to fulfil their heightened demands for nutrients and energy, essential for uncontrolled proliferation. This reprogramming can reveal novel metabolic vulnerabilities to ferroptosis. For example, RB1 inactivation in prostate cancer, associated with resistance to standard anti-tumour therapy and poor prognosis, paradoxically sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis by upregulating ACSL4 and enriching arachidonic acid-containing phospholipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Conversely, specific oncogenic mutations may confer an advantage to cancer cells in evading ferroptosis. TP53, the most frequently mutated tumour suppressor gene, promotes ferroptosis by suppressing genes like SLC7A11, SAT1 and VKORC1L1, whereas p53 loss confers ferroptosis resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.

Integrating multiple high-throughput datasets, we demonstrated that ALDH16A1 is a direct transcriptional target of SMARCA4, mediating its ferroptosis-inducing effects independently of ALDH activity. Furthermore, ALDH16A1 interacts with the anti-ferroptotic protein TXN, promoting its lysosomal degradation and potentially inhibiting its oxidoreductase function by blocking its active site (Cys32-Cys35), as implied by the binding model predicted by AlphaFold2. Thus, this dual mechanism simultaneously destabilizes and disables TXN. Our findings reveal that disruption of the SMARCA4/ALDH16A1/TXN axis not only protects NSCLC from ferroptosis-induced cell death but also impairs ferroptosis-associated immunotherapy efficacy in vitro and in vivo (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).<fig id="Fig7" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>A schematic model depicting the SMARCA4-ALDH16A1-TXN stability/function-ferroptosis axis.</title><p>In this work, we identify SMARCA4 as a ferroptosis-promoting tumour suppressor gene.

Approximately 25% of cancers harbour SWI/SNF gene aberrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In contrast to classical oncogenes and tumour suppressors like RAS and TP53, which have been studied for more than 40 years, the oncogenic role of SWI/SNF mutations has only recently gained recognition. As revealed in multiple clinical research, nearly 10% NSCLC patients were identified to possess SMARCA4 mutation. In agreement with its tumour-suppressing property, SMARCA4 mutations, especially those &#8220;class I&#8221; mutations, which are characterized by SMARCA4 protein loss, are associated with poorer survival.

Currently, a consensus on therapeutic approaches for SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC is lacking. Researchers have proposed various survival dependencies in SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC. For instance, Zhu et al. uncovered that SMARCA4/2 loss represses expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1, causing reduced glycolysis and increased dependency on glutamine-fuelled OXPHOS, suggesting the SMARCA4/2 deficient cancers might be sensitive to the inhibitors targeting OXPHOS or glutamine uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, obvious progress has been made in SWI/SNF inhibitors, as SMARCA4 deficiency might result in synthetic lethal dependencies on other SWI/SNF components such as SMARCA2. Nonetheless, this phenomenon is context dependent, and its therapeutic translation is still underway. Notably, SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC typically responds poorly to conventional chemotherapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, possibly due to SMARCA4 loss inhibiting chemotherapy-induced apoptosis by disrupting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Our prior work established ferroptosis&#8217;s role in chemotherapy-induced cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The present study uncovered the ferroptosis resistance in SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC, offering an alternative explanation for its chemoresistance. Supportively, the CRISPR/Cas9 screening data using ML210 as FIN performed by Zou et al. also included SMARCA4 as a potential ferroptosis promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. However, a contradictory result was reported in pancreatic cancer by Bhat et al.

Their conclusion was supported by efficient experimental data and bioinformatic analysis based on Depmap&#8217;s high-throughput data. Considering the complicated intracellular ferroptosis regulating network and the substantial difference in mutational background among various cell lines, cells&#8217; response to ferroptosis might also be regulated by other factors beyond SMARCA4, thus leading up to the opposing results in different context. Given that the cell lines enrolled in this study all possess EGFR (PC9 and H1975) or KRAS (A549 and H23), we questioned whether SMARCA4&#8217;s impact on ferroptosis depends on these two commonly mutated gene?

Meanwhile, clinical studies have shown that SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC patients benefit from ICB treatment, indicating a potential vulnerability in this NSCLC subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Supportively, a large sample size clinical research has suggested that NSCLC patients with homozygous truncating SMARCA4 mutations had significantly worse OS on checkpoint immunotherapy compared to WT patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. In recent years, the intricate interplay between ferroptosis and tumour immunity has garnered significant research interest. On the one hand, ferroptosis contributes to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells induced cell death during cancer immunotherapy. On the other hand, ferroptotic cancer cells can release immunostimulatory damage-associated molecular patterns, which assists the recruitment and activation of immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Our study, through bioinformatic analysis and in vitro/in vivo experiments, confirmed that combining PD-1 antibody treatment with ALDH16A1 overexpression or TXN inhibitors synergistically enhances anti-tumour immunity in SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC. Thus, targeting the SMARCA4/ALDH16A1/TXN/ferroptosis pathway represents a promising strategy to magnify the efficacy of immunotherapy in this challenging NSCLC subtype.</p><p id="Par39">In conclusion, by identifying SMARCA4 as a pro-ferroptotic tumour suppressor, our study illuminates the role of the SMARCA4/ALDH16A1/TXN axis in ferroptosis regulation and its underlying mechanisms. Given the high mutation rate of SMARCA4 in NSCLC and its refractory clinical characteristic, our findings uncover a targetable vulnerability in SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC and provide a rationale for clinical studies to explore whether targeting this pathway can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy by promoting ferroptosis in this difficult-to-treat cancer subtype.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par40">The use of patient samples and animal models in this research complies with all relevant ethical regulations of Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University, including the Institutional Review Board and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Cell lines and culture condition</title><p id="Par41">Cells were maintained at 37&#8201;&#176;C under a 5% CO&#8322; humidified atmosphere.

Genomic DNA from each group were extracted and subjected to paired-end sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). If a gene essential for tumour cell survival is knocked out by an sgRNA, those sgRNAs specific to that gene would be scarcely present in the surviving population.
