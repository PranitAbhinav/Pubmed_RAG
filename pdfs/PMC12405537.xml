However, their effectiveness in achieving wider conservation goals is often doubted. This study evaluates the impact of giant panda reserves on the habitat suitability of 12 endangered species within 5&#8201;km of roads and assesses changes in human disturbances. Using data from the third and fourth national panda surveys and a matching approach, results show that these reserves enhance giant panda population density and habitat suitability, and benefit most wildlife species, particularly ungulates, with spillover effects improving adjacent areas&#8217; habitat suitability, likely due to reduced human disturbances. However, some species like the Chinese red panda (<italic toggle="yes">Ailurus styani</italic>) still gain limited protection. The findings stress the need for more targeted measures in the Giant Panda National Park&#8217;s development. This multispecies study offers solid evidence for the effectiveness of giant panda conservation efforts and useful insights for protecting other flagship species.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Ecology</kwd><kwd>Ecology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In the Anthropocene, biodiversity faces unprecedented threats driven by the rapid development of human society and the global economy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Current research indicated that we are amidst the sixth mass extinction event<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Scientists are exploring strategies to combat biodiversity loss, including the Convention on Biological Diversity&#8217;s (CBD) proposed 30&#215;30 target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, limited conservation funding presents a significant challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, making it impractical to comprehensively protect all areas with conservation value<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In addition to financial constraints, social considerations&#8212;such as land use conflicts, community interests, and environmental justice&#8212;also play a crucial role in determining conservation priorities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In this context, focusing on the conservation of rare and endangered species has been widely recognized as an effective approach to achieving regional biodiversity conservation goals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

A prime example of this is the Chinese government&#8217;s conservation efforts for the giant panda (<italic toggle="yes">Ailuropoda melanoleuca</italic>). These efforts have not only safeguarded the giant panda but also protected the habitats of tens of thousands of other species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and preserved critical ecosystem functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

Historically, giant pandas were widely distributed across eastern China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, due to factors such as climate change, natural habitat shifts, and human activities, their population and habitat have dramatically declined. Today, giant pandas are confined to six mountain ranges in central and western China&#8212;Qinling (QIN), Minshan (MS), Qionglaishan (QIO), Daxiangling (DXL), Xiaoxiangling (XXL), and Liangshan (LS)&#8212;with their current geographic range representing less than 1% of their historical distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

By 2018, the number of such reserves had increased to 67, forming a comprehensive habitat protection network. In 2021, to ensure the integrity of giant panda habitats, China officially designated the Giant Panda National Park, which encompasses an area of 22,000&#8201;km&#178;. The park protects over 70% of the panda&#8217;s habitat and connects 13 isolated panda populations through ecological corridors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Since 1974, China has conducted four national surveys on the giant panda, approximately every decade. The two most recent surveys, the third (1999&#8211;2003)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and fourth (2011&#8211;2014)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> survey, revealed significant progress in habitat restoration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and underscored the potential role of the national park in future conservation efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In addition to investing substantial resources in establishing reserves and conducting surveys, the Chinese government has implemented large-scale conservation programs across the panda&#8217;s range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, such as the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The GTGP compensates landowners for converting farmland to forest, while the NFCP provides financial support to local governments for forest conservation and management.</p><p id="Par5">Given the substantial investment by the Chinese government in the giant panda conservation program, its effectiveness has been a focal point of academic inquiry, particularly regarding the efficacy of the nature reserve system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> Studies have shown that improvements in the habitat suitability of the giant panda are largely attributable to the protection afforded by reserves, with spillover effects observed beyond reserve boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. These positive impacts are also expected to enhance the resilience of giant pandas to climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, research indicates that the establishment of reserves has successfully curbed increases in human disturbances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and that forest benefits within reserves are significantly higher than those outside<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. While the effectiveness of the reserve system in supporting giant panda populations and habitats has been extensively studied, little is known about its protective impacts on other co-occurring wildlife species.</p><p id="Par6">To date, a limited number of studies have demonstrated that nature reserves effectively protect the habitats of most rare and endangered wildlife species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, certain species, such as forest musk deer (<italic toggle="yes">Moschus berezovskii</italic>), Asiatic black bears (<italic toggle="yes">Ursus thibetanus</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and apex predators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, remain inadequately protected. Research on the giant panda nature reserve network in Sichuan has revealed significant increases in populations of herbivores and medium-sized carnivores over the past decade, highlighting the reserves&#8217; positive impacts on these wildlife groups. However, the current reserve system falls short in safeguarding large carnivores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Additionally, differences in habitat use among wildlife species mean that those with specialized habitat requirements often fail to benefit from the giant panda reserve system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. While these findings suggest limitations in the reserves&#8217; effectiveness for multi-species conservation, many of these studies suffer from a critical issue: they fail to account for environmental differences inside and outside reserves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Simply comparing conditions within and beyond reserve boundaries cannot reliably capture the reserves&#8217; true impacts on biodiversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Significant disparities in environmental and accessibility conditions may introduce bias in either direction&#8212;underestimating reserve effectiveness when reserves are subject to greater human pressure, or overestimating it when reserves are located in areas with naturally low disturbance (e.g., remote or high-altitude regions)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This highlights the need for spatially controlled evaluation designs to minimize such biases.</p><p id="Par7">To address the aforementioned issues, we employed a more rigorous analytical method&#8212;the matching approach&#8212;to evaluate the effectiveness of giant panda nature reserves in conserving multiple species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Specifically, we utilized this approach (detailed in Methods) to investigate the impact of giant panda reserves on the habitat suitability of various endangered wildlife species between 2003 and 2014. Furthermore, we analyzed the spillover effects of reserves on wildlife habitat suitability and assessed the impact of reserves on changes in human disturbances. Our study provides robust evidence for evaluating the effectiveness of the giant panda conservation program, offering new insights into its broader conservation outcomes and informing future biodiversity protection strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Increased giant panda density from 2003 to 2014</title><p id="Par8">The density of giant pandas increased from approximately 2.9 individuals/100&#8201;km<sup>2</sup> to 3.5 individuals/100&#8201;km<sup>2</sup> together (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>) with an increase in habitat (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>), between the last two national surveys.

Compared to the third survey, the suitable habitat areas for most species increased in the fourth survey. For example, the habitat area of the tufted deer (<italic toggle="yes">Elaphodus cephalophus</italic>) increased by 10,131&#8201;km&#178;, and that of the leopard cat (<italic toggle="yes">Prionailurus bengalensis</italic>) increased by 11,771&#8201;km&#178; (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These findings preliminarily suggested that the conservation measures implemented for the giant panda have also provided significant protection for co-occurring wildlife. However, we observed decreases in the suitable habitat areas of the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey (<italic toggle="yes">Rhinopithecus roxellana</italic>) and the Chinese red panda (<italic toggle="yes">Ailurus styani</italic>), particularly in the LS. Most wildlife species (including Chinese takin (<italic toggle="yes">Budorcas tibetana</italic>), Chinese serow (<italic toggle="yes">Capricornis milneedwardsii</italic>), Chinese goral (<italic toggle="yes">Naemorhedus goral</italic>), forest musk deer (<italic toggle="yes">Moschus berezovskii</italic>), and Asiatic black bear (<italic toggle="yes">Ursus thibetanus</italic>)) also exhibited a declining trend in habitat distribution within LS. This decline may be attributed to higher levels of human disturbance in this region (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4C</xref>).

Among these, ungulates appear to benefit the most from the reserves (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Historically, ungulates have been one of the primary targets of poachers. The establishment of reserves and the implementation of enforcement measures have provided artificial protection for their survival. This helps explain why many ungulate species rely heavily on nature reserves for shelter and foraging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Moreover, our results reveal positive spillover effects of the giant panda reserves, as indicated by increased habitat suitability in adjacent areas (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This indicated that the giant panda nature reserves not only effectively protect giant pandas themselves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> but also play a crucial role in improving the habitat suitability of co-occurring wildlife. This suggests that the protective influence of nature reserves can extend beyond their formal boundaries, benefiting co-occurring wildlife species. While early literature often anticipated negative spillover&#8212;where protection might displace human pressures outward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>&#8212;our findings align with more recent studies reporting positive ecological spillovers under certain conservation regimes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that this effect may stem from heightened conservation awareness among local communities near the reserves, leading to reduced exploitation of natural resources. Additionally, policies associated with giant panda conservation may have shifted livelihood activities in these areas from agriculture and animal husbandry to ecotourism-related services, thereby reducing disturbances to species habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

Previous studies often relied on direct comparisons between protected and non-nature reserves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, overlooking landscape heterogeneity.

In contrast, our study applied a matching analysis framework to minimize such biases by ensuring that comparison sites outside reserves were similar in key environmental and anthropogenic factors (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). By matching only areas with comparable levels of human influence, we were able to isolate the actual effects of reserve designation.

Although occurrences of large carnivores such as snow leopards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> have been increasingly reported within conservation areas&#8212;suggesting that these reserves may provide partial benefits&#8212;their extensive habitat requirements cannot be fully met by panda reserves alone. In our study, found evidence that habitats of some species are still declining in certain mountain ranges (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Notably, the red pandas have suffered habitat loss and show no apparent positive spillover benefits from the reserves (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). While giant panda reserves play an important role in conserving many rare and endangered species (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and significantly reduce direct human disturbances such as poaching (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), over-reliance on these reserves may be insufficient for meeting the ecological needs of certain taxa. Therefore, targeted conservation strategies are needed for species with specific and distinct habitat requirements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">In recent years, efforts to expand the network of panda reserves have led to increases in both the area and quality of protected habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. For example, the number of giant panda natural reserves increased from 31 to 46, and the area of the giant panda natural reserves increased from approximately 17,500&#8201;km<sup>2</sup> to 24,200&#8201;km<sup>2</sup> during this interval period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Despite these gains, our results indicate that the effectiveness of panda reserves in safeguarding co-occurring wildlife still faces challenges in several mountain ranges, particularly DXL, XXL, and LS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Currently, livestock presence ranks as the foremost threat factor, especially in areas like MS, XXL, and LS (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). In these regions, unrestricted livestock grazing not only competes with wildlife for food resources but also disrupts their habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Thus, the first targeted conservation strategy should focus on regulating livestock activities within the habitats shared by giant pandas and other wildlife. We also observed an increasing trend in the number of hydropower stations in the surveyed areas, notably in QIO, LS, and DXL. Thus, the second targeted strategy should focus on the management of hydropower stations in these mountains, especially in the natural reserve region (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Since the fourth survey, increased regulation of hydropower development by local governments has led to improved management of these areas. The HSI of several co-occurring animals decreased in the QIO and LS during these ten years (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We suggest that future conservation should focus on these mountains to improve the population recovery of some co-occurring animals. Our results revealed that habitat suitability improvements were spatially uneven, and certain areas such as DXL, XXL, and LS still suffer from ongoing habitat fragmentation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

These measures, combined with continued control of human disturbances, could offer additional benefits for the conservation of both giant pandas and co-occurring wildlife.</p><p id="Par20">One important limitation of our study is that the effects attributed to nature reserves may not be entirely distinguishable from those of other large-scale conservation initiatives, particularly the NFCP and GTGP. Both programs have been extensively implemented in the same regions as the panda nature reserves and are known to influence habitat quality, forest regeneration, and patterns of human activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. While our analysis is spatially explicit and primarily focuses on reserve boundaries to infer conservation effects, we acknowledge that these broader policy interventions may have contributed to the observed changes in habitat suitability.

In the Sichuan province, the third survey employed over 1000 staff members and surveyed approximately 16,000&#8201;km<sup>2</sup>, and the fourth survey employed over 2000 workers and surveyed approximately 27,400&#8201;km<sup>2</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). A detailed field survey can be found in the third and fourth national giant panda surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Firstly, 2&#8201;km<sup>2</sup> surveying grids (square) were established in the digital maps of the mountainous regions and the fourth surveyed region covered most of the third surveyed regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Secondly, in each grid, the surveying line was based on landscape characteristics, plant coverage, bamboo distribution, altitude, and wild field accessibility conditions. The length of the &#8216;Z&#8217; shape line was approximately 0.75&#8201;km and was used to gather information regarding the panda and co-occurring animals living conditions, such as panda activities, feces, hairs, trace, bamboo species, coverages, and landscape information. Finally, to prevent duplications in species distribution points, instances of activity traces for the same species observed within a 300-meter radius were recorded only once. It is noteworthy that in cases where the species cannot be identified from the traces, it is documented as unknown. Through the above survey methods, we obtained activity locations of giant pandas and co-occurring wildlife species (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Environmental variables</title><p id="Par24">We selected 14 environmental variables for the correlation analysis in this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Based on relevant research, we categorized these variables into four groups: climate, topography, vegetation, land use and human disturbance (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Climate variables, derived from CHELSA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chelsa-climate.org">http://chelsa-climate.org</ext-link>), included precipitation (PR), monthly average maximum temperature (TMAX), and monthly average minimum temperature (TMIN). Topographic variables consisted of elevation (ELE) and slope (SLP). Vegetation was represented by the maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), obtained from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences&#8217; Remote Sensing Team for Land Use and Global Change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Land use data, sourced from the Data Center for Resources and Environment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.resdc.cn/">http://www.resdc.cn/</ext-link>), include categories such as forest land, grassland, water bodies, constructed land, and bare land. Human disturbance factors encompass roads and human settlements. Using the Euclidean Distance tool in ArcGIS 10.8, we calculated the distance from each grid cell to these land-use types and disturbance factors, labeling them as distance to forest land (DTF), grassland (DTG), water bodies (DTW), constructed land (DTC), cropland (DTCR), bare land (DTB), roads (DTR), and settlements (DTS). In the species distribution model, all environmental variables except disturbance factors were included, as these were reserved for subsequent matching analysis. It is essential to note that the data obtained from the third and fourth national panda surveys are from different time periods, accounting for temporal variations in environmental variables. In our model analysis, environmental variables such as climate, vegetation, and land use correspond to their respective time periods. To minimize multicollinearity among environmental variables, we performed a spearman correlation analysis and excluded one variable from each pair with a correlation coefficient |r&#8201;|&#8201;&gt; 0.75 (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). As a result, DTCR, TMAX and TMIN were removed (Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). These procedures are widely applied in MaxEnt modeling to reduce spatial autocorrelation and multicollinearity, which could otherwise introduce bias into model performance and the interpretation of variable importance.<table-wrap id="Tab2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Results of correlation analysis for environmental variables</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" id="d33e1360" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="44185_2025_104_Tab1_HTML.jpg"/><table-wrap-foot><p>The upper right corner of the table shows the spearman correlation test results for environmental variables from the third surveys (1999&#8211;2003).

The survey area was divided into several 100&#8201;km<sup>2</sup> units and a statistical overlay analysis was performed with the individual panda points of the third or fourth surveys. Thus, panda density per unit area was obtained in ArcGIS 10.8 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arcgis.com/index.html">https://www.arcgis.com/index.html</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Spatiotemporal dynamics of wildlife habitat suitability analysis</title><p id="Par26">MaxEnt 3.3.3k<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> software was used to model wildlife habitat regions between the third and fourth surveys based on species occurrence points and environmental factors (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Compared to other species distribution models, MaxEnt has demonstrated superior accuracy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The output of MaxEnt is a probability map, which can be interpreted as the Habitat Suitability Index (HSI). The HSI values range from 0 (unsuitable habitat) to 1 (suitable habitat), providing a detailed spatial representation of habitat suitability for the species under study.</p><p id="Par27">In this study, we utilized wildlife occurrence data collected during the third and fourth surveys to predict the habitat suitability distribution of co-occurring animals across different time periods. To reduce the effects of spatial autocorrelation in the species occurrence data, we filtered the occurrence points for each period based on a 1&#8201;km radius criterion: we randomly retained only one point if multiple points were located within a distance of less than 1&#8201;km from each other. After filtering based on conservation status and endangerment levels, 12 species were selected for further analysis (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These 12 species represent typical mammal and bird found within panda habitat, with sufficient population sizes and encounter rates (excluding the rare species), making them suitable indicators of regional biodiversity in this study.</p><p id="Par28">We constructed separate MaxEnt models for the third and fourth surveys, utilizing occurrence points and environmental variables corresponding to the respective periods (2000 and 2010). The MaxEnt model parameters were set as follows: random test percentage at 20%, a maximum number of 10,000 background points; 10 replicates, and a regularization multiplier of 1. The final model prediction was generated as an averaged output grid from the 10 replicates, producing a logistic habitat suitability index ranging from 0 (least suitable) to 1 (most suitable). To convert the continuous habitat suitability maps into binary suitable/unsuitable habitat maps, we applied maximum training sensitivity plus specificity logistic threshold. Subsequently, to assess habitat suitability changes for each species between the two periods, we used the Raster Calculator in ArcGIS 10.8 to compute the difference in habitat suitability values for each species across the two time periods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Estimating the impact of nature reserves on habitat suitability change</title><p id="Par29">Due to systematic differences in biogeographical conditions between areas inside and outside nature reserves&#8212;such as initial habitat conditions, elevation, and remoteness&#8212;direct comparisons are not feasible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To address this, we employed a multivariate matching approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> to evaluate the impact of giant panda nature reserves on habitat suitability changes for different species between 2001 and 2013. The primary goal of the matching method is to control for observable differences between protected pixels (inside nature reserves) and unprotected pixels (outside nature reserves), ensuring an &#8220;apples-to-apples&#8221; comparison. While a difference-in-differences (DID) approach combined with matching could be ideal for isolating treatment effects over time, its application requires high-resolution temporal data and the fulfillment of the parallel trends assumption. Due to data limitations&#8212;specifically, the lack of continuous trend data at the pixel level across multiple time points&#8212;we adopted matching as a more feasible and robust alternative under these conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The habitat suitability distributions obtained from the model provided a large sample of data for matching analysis, effectively mitigating the limitations often associated with the matching method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This ensures a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of the effects of PAs on habitat suitability changes.</p><p id="Par30">In this study, we first screened the pixels included in the analysis based on the following criteria: 1) Exclusion of unlikely habitats. Pixels classified as bare land, built-up areas, or water bodies were excluded, as these areas are unlikely to serve as habitats for the species under study. 2) Exclusion of newly established nature reserves. Given that our study focuses on the impact of nature reserves on habitat suitability changes between 2001 and 2013, PAs established after 2000 (n&#8201;=&#8201;31) were excluded from the analysis. 3) Addressing spillover effects. Previous studies have shown that the effects of PAs can extend to adjacent unprotected lands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. To minimize the influence of such spillover effects on our assessment, we excluded pixels located within 20&#8201;km of the boundaries of panda PAs. 4) Focus on accessible areas. Pixels located more than 5&#8201;km away from roads were excluded. This distance threshold was selected based on prior knowledge of human accessibility and disturbance in the region: areas beyond 5&#8201;km from roads are often extremely remote, with steep terrain and limited accessibility, and are thus rarely affected by direct human activities. Including these inaccessibly remote areas in the analysis would introduce bias, as their intact condition may not be attributable to any conservation intervention, but rather to their physical inaccessibility. Limiting the analysis to areas where human influence is feasible allows a more accurate comparison of conservation effectiveness under similar threat pressures. In these remote areas, the protection offered by PAs provides minimal additional value for habitat suitability due to the negligible human disturbance. Including a substantial number of pixels from such low-disturbance areas could dilute the observed effects of PAs, making their impact harder to detect. Moreover, this could obscure the critical contributions of PAs in areas under greater anthropogenic pressure. To address this limitation, we selected only pixels within 5&#8201;km of roads to construct the protected and unprotected pixel groups for impact evaluation. The 5&#8201;km threshold was chosen because residents in the study area typically live near roads, and previous research has indicated that human activities, such as agricultural production and fuel collection, predominantly occur within 5&#8201;km of roads in this region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">For each pixel within the nature reserves, our matching method identified a corresponding pixel outside the nature reserves that was similar across nine covariates (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These covariates included the species-specific initial habitat suitability in 2001 (IHS), elevation (ELE), slope (SLP), distance to roads (DTR), distance to settlements (DTS), distance to constructed land (DTC), distance to water bodies (DTW), NDVI, and precipitation (PR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The inclusion of &#8216;species-specific initial habitat suitability in 2001&#8217; was intended to account for potential temporal changes in habitat suitability that could influence the observed effects of nature reserves. This variable helps to ensure that the comparison between protected and unprotected pixels is robust to variations in baseline habitat conditions. To enhance the quality of matching, a caliper was applied to constrain the difference in each of the eight covariates between protected and unprotected forest pixels to within 0.5 standard deviations. This means that the analysis was designed to force matching pairs from all the regions and reserves included in the study. The matching process was conducted separately for each species to ensure accuracy. The pre-and post-matching environmental variable data distributions are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>.</p><p id="Par32">Post-matching balance assessment used standardized mean differences (SMD) and variance ratios (VR). An SMD threshold of 0.1 was set, with |SMD&#8201;|&#8201;&lt; 0.1 indicating good balance. The VR measured the consistency of covariate distributions, with values between 0.5 and 2 being acceptable. Results showed most covariates had SMD values below 0.1 and VR values within the acceptable range (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), indicating successful removal of systematic differences between groups. The average treatment effect (ATE) was calculated by subtracting the habitat suitability of unprotected pixels from that of matched protected pixels. To correct for potential biases from residual differences in pixel attributes, a bias-adjusted estimator was used, with the regression coefficient (<italic toggle="yes">&#946;</italic>) serving as the ATE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. A positive ATE with P&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 indicates a significant positive reserve impact, while a negative ATE indicates a negative impact. It should be noted that similar analyses for giant pandas were conducted by Yang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Based on kernel density analysis results, we used matching to compare changes in giant panda encounter rates inside and outside reserves (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Post-matching covariate data showed good balance (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

Pixels outside the reserves were grouped into five buffer zones based on their distance from the reserve boundaries: 0&#8211;5&#8201;km, 5&#8211;10&#8201;km, 10&#8211;15&#8201;km, 15&#8211;20&#8201;km, and &gt;20&#8201;km. We employed a matching method to compare habitat suitability changes in the four near-distance groups (0&#8211;5&#8201;km, 5&#8211;10&#8201;km, 10&#8211;15&#8201;km, and 15&#8211;20&#8201;km) with those in the farthest group (&gt;20&#8201;km)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. For these comparisons, we included only pixels within 5&#8201;km of roads to control for accessibility-related factors. The matching procedure was identical to that used for comparing protected and unprotected pixels to quantify the effects of nature reserves on habitat suitability changes. For each pixel in the four near-distance groups, the matching method identified a corresponding pixel in the farthest group with similar values for eight covariates, including the species-specific initial habitat suitability in 2001 (IHS), elevation (ELE), slope (SLP), distance to roads (DTR), distance to settlements (DTS), distance to cropland (DTC), NDVI, and precipitation (PR). The matched dataset achieved good covariate balance between treatment and control groups (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). If (1) a statistically significant difference in habitat suitability change is observed between the near-distance and farthest groups, and (2) the magnitude of this difference gradually diminishes with increasing distance from the reserve, then the presence of a spillover effect of the nature reserve on habitat suitability can be inferred.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Estimating the impact of nature reserves on human disturbance rate</title><p id="Par34">During the surveys, the frequency of various human disturbance types (e.g., logging, livestock, roads, shoot gathering, herb gathering, hunting, farming, mining, tourism, fire marks, and hydropower stations) was recorded along each surveyed transect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Data on human disturbance points were obtained from the third and fourth surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Using the kernel density tool in ArcGIS 10.8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, we calculated the human disturbance rate within the overlapping regions between the two survey periods (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>: approximately 14,472&#8201;km&#178;). To assess whether nature reserves reduced human disturbances, we conducted a matching analysis comparing the change in human disturbance rates inside versus outside protected areas. The matching procedure was conducted using the same method and covariates as for the habitat suitability analysis. This analysis was also restricted to areas within 5&#8201;km of roads, consistent with the habitat suitability assessment, to control for spatial accessibility and observation bias. In this matching framework, the outcome variable was the change in human disturbance rate, while the baseline variable used for matching was the initial human disturbance level, replacing the baseline habitat suitability used in the prior analysis (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The matched dataset achieved good covariate balance between treatment and control groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), supporting the robustness of the inference. We emphasize that while distance-based variables may broadly proxy for human pressure, direct disturbance observations provide a more proximate and empirically grounded indicator of anthropogenic impact. Therefore, we retained this analysis as a complementary evaluation of reserve effectiveness in mitigating human disturbances.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
