While the contributions of CAFs to tumor progression and drug resistance are well established, the precise molecular mechanisms by which they induce chemoresistance remain unclear. A comprehensive understanding of the effect of TME modulation&#8212;particularly through CAFs&#8212;on the chemotherapeutic response is crucial for developing effective strategies to overcome chemoresistance and improve patient survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Primary fibroblasts were isolated from paired clinical samples of bladder cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues to identify key CAF-derived secretory factors. Bioinformatics analysis, semiquantitative RT&#8210;qPCR, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were subsequently used to investigate the functional role and mechanistic basis of CXCL14 in chemoresistance. The therapeutic relevance of these findings was further evaluated through in vitro and in vivo models, including ex vivo patient-derived organoid (PDO) models, by assessing cisplatin sensitivity and validating therapeutic targeting of the CXCL14-CCR7-STAT3 axis with small molecule inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Compared to normal fibroblasts and CAFs from nonchemoresistance groups, CAFs derived from cisplatin-resistant patients demonstrated significantly greater paracrine-mediated induction of chemoresistance. Mechanistically, CAF-secreted CXCL14 engaged CCR7 on bladder cancer cells, triggering STAT3 phosphorylation and consequently upregulating the DNA repair gene ERCC4 to promote cisplatin resistance. In vivo validation confirmed that pharmacological CCR7 or STAT3 inhibition markedly reversed chemoresistance and potentiated cisplatin-induced tumor cell death. Notably, STAT3 activation mediated the overexpression of the glycolytic enzymes HK2 and LDHA, resulting in greater glycolytic flux in resistant cells. This metabolic reprogramming further facilitated the transdifferentiation of normal fibroblasts into CXCL14-secreting CAFs, establishing a self-reinforcing feedback loop that sustains chemoresistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">The CXCL14/CCR7/STAT3 axis critically mediates cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer through dual modulation of DNA repair and glycolytic metabolism. Therapeutic cotargeting of this pathway with CCR7 or STAT3 inhibitors combined with cisplatin represents a promising strategy to overcome chemoresistance and improve clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13046-025-03487-4.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cancer-associated fibroblast</kwd><kwd>Bladder cancer</kwd><kwd>Chemoresistance</kwd><kwd>DNA damage repair</kwd><kwd>CXCL14</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>2022 Chongqing Research Innovation Program for Graduate Student of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University</institution></funding-source><award-id>CYB22199</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82372881</award-id><award-id>82303655</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Chongqing Biomedicine Key R&amp;D Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>CSTB2021TIAD-KPX0041</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Italian National Cancer Institute &#8216;Regina Elena&#8217; 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Bladder cancer is the predominant type of urothelial carcinoma and accounts for 3% of global cancer mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Primary chemoresistance poses a major barrier in patients ineligible for surgery, for whom platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard regimen for advanced or metastatic bladder cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While platinum agents exert cytotoxicity by inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and activating the DNA damage response (DDR), intrinsic resistance mechanisms frequently compromise therapeutic efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Critically, nearly 50% of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients are reportedly cisplatin-ineligible due to preexisting resistance or comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This high prevalence of primary chemoresistance leads to DDR pathway hyperactivation, attenuated cancer cell death, and ultimately poor prognosis. It is therefore urgent to overcome this limitation to improve cisplatin response rates and survival outcomes.
</p><p id="Par6">Multiple factors may contribute to DNA damage repair, rather than focusing on the development of chemoresistance within cancer cells themselves, this study focuses on alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that play crucial roles in regulating the malignant progression of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The TME is known as a multicellular system comprising various mesenchymal and immune cells. Among the major cellular components of the tumor stroma, the cross talk between cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor cells holds great value in the development of chemoresistance in most solid cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Transcriptionally and functionally heterogeneous subsets of CAFs have been identified in several solid cancers, and different CAFs have been reported to promote the chemoresistance of cancer cells by not only remodeling the extracellular matrix and forming a barrier for drug or therapeutic immune cell penetration, but also secreting various cytokines or metabolites and affecting targeted tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. While growing evidence underscores the intricate interplay between CAFs and cancer cells, which significantly impacts their sensitivity to anticancer therapeutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], how CAFs regulate the development of chemoresistance in bladder cancer cells is not as well explored.
</p><p id="Par7">CAFs often secrete chemokines that significantly impact cancer cell behavior, with both CXC and CC chemokines playing crucial roles in regulating DDR mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For example, Dedobbeleer et al. demonstrated that stromal-derived C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) reduces cell death in glioblastoma and enhances DNA repair by modulating key apoptotic regulators and stabilizing the DNA repair protein RAD51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. CXCL14, also known as breast and kidney-expressed chemokine (BRAK), has traditionally been considered an inflammatory and immune modulator. However, its effects can vary across different tumors depending on the cellular context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Recent studies suggest that CXCL14 derived from CAFs may promote malignant progression in ovarian and breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Nevertheless, the role of CXCL14 in bladder cancer remains to be fully elucidated.</p><p id="Par8">In the present study, we focused on the role of CAFs in facilitating chemoresistance in bladder cancer cells. For the first time, we identify the crucial role of CAF-derived CXCL14 in regulating the DDR and glucose metabolic reprogrammig of cancer cells. Additionally, the combination of cisplatin-based chemotherapy with CCR7 or STAT3-targeted therapies may offer a more effective treatment strategy for patients with bladder cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical tissues collection and primary fibroblasts isolation</title><p id="Par9">Bladder cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer at The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. All samples were confirmed to originate from urothelial tissue, as verified by radiomic analysis before surgery and pathological examination after surgery. Adjacent tissues were collected from those located more than 5 cm away from the cancer tissues. Patients were stratified into two groups: the na&#239;ve group and the chemotherapy-treated group based on their receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy prior to surgery. Subsequently, the chemotherapy-treated group was further evaluated based on their response to chemotherapeutic agents, monitored by contrast-enhanced CT scans conducted before and after treatment: patients exhibiting progressive disease (PD) or stable disease (SD) were categorized as chemoresistant bladder cancer patients, while those demonstrating complete or partial response were classified as chemosensitive.</p><p id="Par10">For primary fibroblast isolation, fresh cancer and adjacent tissues were obtained from patients undergoing radical cystectomy, and transferred on ice. After eliminating blood, connective tissue and vessels, tissues were digested for 1 h at 37 &#176;C with 1 mg/ml collagenase A (Solarbio, China, cat. C8140). Enzymatic digestion was halted and then filtered through 70 &#181;m cell strainers and centrifuged. Cells were seeded undisturbed in DMEM/F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 3 days at 37 &#176;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Nonadherent cells were discarded, and the remaining cells underwent differential trypsinization. Following centrifugation and cell counting, cell pellet was resuspended and mixed with anti-fibroblast microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany, cat. 130&#8211;050-601). The mixture was resuspended in 500 &#181;L buffer. The cell suspension was applied onto the column, which was placed in the magnetic field of a suitable+ MACS separator (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. 130&#8211;042-501), and the flow-through containing unlabeled cells was discarded. After removing the separator, moderate buffer was dripped and the magnetically labeled cells were flushed out. The isolated primary fibroblasts were then incubated for further experiments.</p><p id="Par11">Collection of clinical specimens and related procedures were conducted with approval from the Internal Review and Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, and all patients provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p id="Par12">Two strains of human bladder cancer cells (T24 and UM-UC-3) were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai.

All samples were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Following dewaxing with dimethylbenzene and hydration in gradient ethanol, sections underwent a 15 min incubation in 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at room temperature. Subsequently, antigen retrieval was achieved by incubating the sections in Tris&#8211;EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) at 100 &#176;C for 30 min. After blocking, the sections were subsequently incubated overnight at 4 &#176;C with primary antibodies (anti-alpha smooth muscle actin (&#945;-SMA), Abcam, cat. ab7817; anti-cleaved caspase 3, Proteintech, cat. 19,677&#8211;1-AP; anti-Ki67, Proteintech, cat. 27,309&#8211;1-AP). After that, the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies and then stained with 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) and hematoxylin. Positive cells were characterized by distinct brown staining.

Once the average tumor volume reached approximately 200 mm^3, the tumor-bearing mice were administered cisplatin (3 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. This treatment was given in combination with CCR7i (7.3 &#181;g/kg) or STAT3i (10 mg/kg), or an equivalent volume of PBS. All treatments were administered twice a week.

Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis confirmed the characteristic markers of these fibroblasts. Both normal fibroblasts (NFs) and CAFs were positive for vimentin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E), an interstitial cell marker, but CAFs presented increased expression of activated fibroblast markers, including FAP, FSP1, and &#945;-SMA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F).

To assess the long-term effects of CM treatment, we performed a colony formation assay under 1 &#956;g/mL cisplatin, which revealed that CAF/CM significantly enhanced the chemoresistance of bladder cancer cells in spheroids (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>J). The TME is a complex system characterized by intricate cellular compositions and interactions. To validate our findings in vivo, we investigated the impact of CAFs on cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer xenografts. Following the coinjection of bladder cancer cells with either NFs or CAFs subcutaneously, the mice were treated with four weeks of cisplatin or PBS via intraperitoneal injection.

Consequently, we examined the expression of these key regulators in bladder cancer cells to investigate the mechanism triggered by CAFs. As shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A and B, both ERCC4 and MRP2 were upregulated at the transcriptional level following CAF/CM treatment in T24 and UM-UC-3 cells. Western blot analysis further confirmed the overexpression of ERCC4 and MRP2 in these two cell lines after CAF/CM treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C and Fig. S2 A, B). Additionally, after treatment with 1 &#956;g/mL cisplatin, we observed that compared with the medium control or NF/CM, the CAF/CM significantly inhibited drug-induced apoptosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). To explore the roles of ERCC4 and MRP2 in the development of drug resistance in bladder cancer cells, we modulated their expression in T24 and UM-UC-3 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D, F and Fig. S2 E, G) and confirmed the effects of their knockdown at the translational level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E, G and Fig. S2 F, H). We subsequently assessed the sensitivity of these cells to cisplatin following incubation with CAF/CM. Our results demonstrated that the suppression of ERCC4 expression mitigated the chemoresistance induced by CAF/CM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H, I and Fig. S2 C, D), whereas the inhibition of MRP2 had no such effect (Fig. S2 I, J). ERCC4, also known as XPF, is a component of the ERCC1-XPF structure-specific endonuclease and plays a crucial role in DDR processes including nucleotide excision repair (NER), interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair, and homologous recombination (HR) repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. ERCC4 overexpression in cells has been reported to reduce the degree of DNA damage and subsequent apoptosis induced by ICL-containing compound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We assessed DNA damage in bladder cancer cells following different treatments, and the results revealed that CAF/CM significantly inhibited cisplatin-induced DNA damage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>J, K and Fig. S2K, L). To further investigate the role of ERCC4 in chemoresistance, we overexpressed ERCC4 in both cell lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>L, O). The overexpression of ERCC4 led to decreased sensitivity to cisplatin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>M, P and Fig. S2M, N) and reduced DNA damage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>N, Q and Fig. S2O, P) in bladder cancer cells.

We found that CXCL14 was generally overexpressed in these six sets of paired fibroblasts, especially in patient 3 and patient 5 sourced CAFs, which were patients diagnosed with clinical chemoresistance after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). To further understand the relationship between CAFs and CXCL14, we extracted the forementioned chemoresistance-related fibroblast single-cell RNA sequencing data and regrouped them.<fig id="Fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Exogenous CXCL14 contributes to chemoresistance in bladder cancer in a dose dependent manner. <bold>A</bold> KEGG analysis revealed the enriched terms associated with the feature genes of CAFs. <bold>B</bold> RT-PCR was used to determine the expression levels of secretory cytokines in CAFs from different patients, and all the expression levels were relative to those in the paired NF group. <bold>C</bold> Expression of CXCL14 was examined by Western blot in six paired primary fibroblast samples. <bold>D</bold> ELISA measurement of CXCL14 in the supernatants of 6 CAFs and NFs. <bold>E</bold>, <bold>F</bold> IF staining of bladder cancer tissues and paired adjacent tissues for &#945;-SMA and CXCL14.

GO functional analysis was used to explore the functional characteristics of those subtypes. The biological process of Cluster 0 was enriched mainly in &#8220;T cell mediated immunity&#8221;, that of Cluster 1 was enriched mainly in &#8220;extracellular matrix organization&#8221;, and that of Cluster 2 was enriched mainly in &#8220;animal organ morphogenesis&#8221; (Fig. S3 C). Pseudotime analysis revealed that Cluster 2 was projected onto the root, Cluster 0 was projected onto the trunk, and Cluster 1 was projected onto two branches, one as a single branch and another differentiated from part of Cluster 0 (Fig. S3 D, E). As mentioned above, previous studies have reported that CAFs can be categorized into various subsets on the basis of their specific functions and several biomarkers, including inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While the precise functions of each subgroup remain unclear, we identified distinct gene signatures for different subsets during our analysis. Notably, the gene signatures of Cluster 0 coincided with certain markers associated with iCAFs, such as SDC1, CD70 and LIF. The gene signatures of Cluster 1 aligned with specific markers of myCAFs, whereas the corresponding CAF subgroup was not identified in Cluster 2. By integrating our findings from pseudotime and GO enrichment analyses, we identified this particular subgroup as being involved in the initiation and activation of CAFs and therefore referred to it as na&#239;ve CAFs (Fig. S3 F). These results indicate the potential of na&#239;ve CAFs as the initial strain that grows into iCAFs and then differentiates into iCAFs and myCAFs. Therefore, we detected the expression of CXCL14 in those three clusters, and found that CXCL14 was overexpressed in both the iCAF and na&#239;ve-CAF subtypes (Fig. S3 G, H). In combination with previous findings that CXCL14 overexpression is consistent with chemoresistance in bladder cancer patients, we classified abnormal CXCL14 expressing CAFs as differentiated iCAFs or undifferentiated na&#239;ve CAFs.</p><p id="Par35">To further investigate the role and function of CXCL14 in bladder cancer progression, we evaluated the translational expression of CXCL14 in the aforementioned patient-derived tissues. Western blot analysis revealed significant upregulation of CXCL14 in CAFs, particularly in patients exhibiting chemoresistance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). By measuring the concentration of CXCL14 in the CM of six paired fibroblasts, we observed that compared with NFs, CAFs produced and secreted more CXCL14 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). To further explore the distribution of CXCL14 expression within the TME, immunofluorescence staining was conducted for &#945;-SMA and CXCL14 in tissue samples from Patient 1 and Patient 3. The results revealed that CAFs were the primary source of CXCL14 in tumor tissues, with significantly elevated expression levels observed in chemoresistant patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E, F). To explore the role of CXCL14 in the development of chemoresistance in bladder cancer, we performed GSEA using RNA-seq data from 414 bladder cancer patients in the TCGA database. The analysis revealed that CXCL14 is functionally enriched not only in the"bladder cancer"pathway but also in several cell cycle and DNA damage repair-related pathways, including"base excision repair,""mismatch repair,""nucleotide excision repair,"and"homologous recombination"(Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>G and Fig. S3 I). Additionally, Pearson regression analysis of TCGA data revealed a significant correlation between CXCL14 expression and pathways associated with the"cell cycle"and"DNA damage"(Fig. S3 J, K). These findings suggest that CXCL14 may play a role in modulating DNA damage repair, which is consistent with the known functions of ERCC4.</p><p id="Par36">Therefore, we next examined whether deficient expression of CXCL14 in CAFs affects cisplatin induced DNA damage in bladder cancer cells. We inhibited CXCL14 expression in CAFs using lentivirus transfection. The efficiency of the lentivirus was validated at the transcriptional and translational levels (Fig S3L, M), and the secretion of CXCL14 in CAFs was significantly inhibited (Fig.S3N). We then treated bladder cancer cells with CM from different groups, and immunofluorescence staining of &#947;H2AX revealed decreased DNA damage in T24 and UM-UC-3 cells incubated with CAFs/CM, which lost their protective role after CXCL14 expression was modulated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>H, K). Cell viability assays indicated that CAF/CM-induced chemoresistance to cisplatin in bladder cancer cells was significantly blocked after CXCL14 was intervened in CAFs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>I, L and Fig. S3 O, P). Western blot analysis revealed that deficient expression of CXCL14 in CAFs failed to increase the expression of ERCC4 and inhibited DNA damage-induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>J, M). These findings indicated that CAF-derived CXCL14 promotes the development of chemoresistance in bladder cancer cells by enhancing ERCC4-mediated DNA damage repair. We used recombinant human CXCL14 (rhCXCL14) to simulate the effect of exogenous CXCL14 on bladder cancer cells. The results revealed that rhCXCL14 treatment significantly increased both the transcriptional and translational expression of ERCC4 in T24 and UM-UC-3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>N-Q). Therefore, we identified 10 ng/ml as the optimal concentration. To assess the duration of CXCL14 action in the tumor microenvironment and its potential for reversing drug resistance, we blocked CXCL14 in CAF/CM by adding either IgG or a CXCL14 neutralizing antibody. Western blot analysis revealed that exogenous CXCL14 significantly increased ERCC4 expression in bladder cancer cells in CXCL14-deficient CAFs. However, this effect was notably inhibited by the addition of the CXCL14 neutralizing antibody in the NC group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>R, S). Additionally, by comparing ERCC4 expression in different bladder cancer cell lines after continuous treatment and subsequent rhCXCL14 removal, we observed that rhCXCL14 consistently promoted ERCC4 overexpression, but this effect was maintained for only 24 h after rhCXCL14 was removed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>T-W).</p><p id="Par37">In summary, our results demonstrate that CXCL14 derived from CAFs within tumor tissues enhances cellular DNA damage repair in a paracrine manner, and its effect on ERCC4 is dose-dependent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>CXCL14 enhances ERCC4 transcription by the CCR7/STAT3 axis</title><p id="Par38">After the promoters of ERCC4 were scanned by JASPAR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jaspar.genereg.net/">https://jaspar.genereg.net/</ext-link>) and PROMO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alggen.lsi.upc.es/">https://alggen.lsi.upc.es/</ext-link>), we found that 18 promoters overlapped (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Given that signaling pathways play important roles in the transcriptional modulation of key cellular regulators, we identified STAT3 as a potential transcriptional regulator of ERCC4, whichwas positively correlated with ERCC4 expression in bladder cancer patients in the TCGA cohort (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). With the use of the ENCODE database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.encodeproject.org">www.encodeproject.org</ext-link>), we detected binding peaks of STAT3 in the promoter regions of ERCC4 in three types of cancer cell lines (Fig.S4A). Immunofluorescence results confirmed that rhCXCL14 activated p-STAT3 and facilitated its nuclear translocation, whereas inhibition of STAT3 activity in T24 cells using STAT3i impaired this activation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). Following the blockade of CXCL14-induced STAT3 activation, we observed subsequent transcriptional inhibition of ERCC4 expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D, E). To investigate whether STAT3 binds to the promoter region of ERCC4 and how CXCL14 enhances its expression in bladder cancer cells, we overexpressed STAT3 in 293 T cells (Fig. S4B) as an external validation and modulated STAT3 phosphorylation in T24 cells with rhCXCL14 or rhCXCL14 combined with STAT3i (Fig. S4C). We cloned the ERCC4 promoter into the pGL3 vector and transfected this construct into various cell lines. The results revealed a significant increase in luciferase activity in STAT3-overexpressing 293 T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F). Additionally, we observed that STAT3 activation by rhCXCL14 significantly increased the luciferase activity of the ERCC4 promoter, while STAT3i effectively blocked this process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G). These findings further confirmed that CXCL14 elevates ERCC4 transcription through STAT3. We analysed four STAT3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets across three different cancer types and identified two prominent STAT3 binding peaks within the ERCC4 promoter region (Fig. S4D). Further motif analysis using the JASPAR database predicted two potential STAT3 binding sites on the ERCC4 promoter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>H). To confirm these binding sites, we introduced mutations at these sites individually or together in the ERCC4 promoter vector (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>I) and transfected these plasmids into different cell lines. Compared with that in the wild-type group, luciferase activity was significantly lower in the cells transfected with mutations at site 1 and at both sites 1 and 2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>J, K). Mutation at site 2 also decreased the fluorescence intensity but to a lesser extent than mutation at site 1 did, indicating that STAT3 primarily enhances ERCC4 expression by binding to the promoter region at the &#8722;384 to &#8722;394 site upstream of the transcriptional start site.<fig id="Fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The CXCL14/CCR7 signaling axis enhances ERCC4 transcription through JAK2/STAT3 activation and transcriptional regulation. <bold>A</bold> Venn diagram showing the overlapping promotors of ERCC4 predicted by JASPAR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jaspar.genereg.net/">https://jaspar.genereg.net/</ext-link>) and PROMO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alggen.lsi.upc.es/">https://alggen.lsi.upc.es/</ext-link>). <bold>B</bold> Correlation analysis between STAT3 and ERCC4 (GEPIA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/">http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/</ext-link>). <bold>C</bold> Representative immunofluorescence images showing the expression and distribution of p-STAT3 in T24 cells following treatment with exogenous CXCL14 or STAT3i.

Compared with previously reported CXCL14 receptors including ACKR2, ACKR3, and CXCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], CCR7 knockdown resulted in the most pronounced inhibition of CXCL14-induced STAT3 activation and ERCC4 protein expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>L, and Fig. S4 F-I). Molecular docking simulations were conducted to examine the interactions between CCR7 and CXCL14. Among the ten docking models with docking scores below 270, the top models were identified, with a docking score of 270 between CCR7 and CXCL14 and a confidence score of 96% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>M). We found that the amino acid residue HIS86 of the CXCL14 protein can bind to the amino acid residue PHE291 of the CCR7 protein via a hydrogen bond of 3.0 &#197;, whereas LYS38 of CXCL14 can bind to ASN292 of the CCR7 protein through a hydrogen bond of 2.1 &#197;. Additionally, ARG31 of the CXCL14 protein forms two hydrogen bonds, measuring 3.1 &#197; and 2.9 &#197;, with the ILE18 residue of the CCR7 protein (Fig. S4J). We confirmed the interaction between CCR7 and CXCL14 in T24 cells through coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>N). Additionally, the interaction between CXCL14 and CCR7 in bladder cancer cells was further validated by fluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>O).</p><p id="Par40">We further confirmed the role of CCR7 in mediating CXCL14 induced ERCC4 overexpression. Following CCR7 knockdown, the activation of STAT3 and the rhCXCL14-induced upregulation of ERCC4 transcription in T24 cells were significantly inhibited (Fig. S4K-M). Cytokines typically bind to receptor subunits, initiating receptor activation and subsequent phosphorylation of Janus kinases. Activated Jak2 then phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the receptor, creating a docking site for STAT3, which is phosphorylated at Tyr705, leading to the activation of STAT3 homodimers. To further investigate the role of CCR7 in mediating CXCL14-induced ERCC4 overexpression and elucidate the associated signaling pathways, we employed the Tet-on system to induce CCR7 knockdown in T24 cells. Upon doxycycline induction, the rhCXCL14-induced activation of JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation and ERCC4 overexpression were significantly inhibited (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>P and Fig. S5A). As a small molecule inhibitor, Cmp2105 was first reported to inhibit CCR7 activation by competitively binding to its ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. After CCR7i treatment or CCR7 knockdown, CXCL14 induced STAT3 activation was effectively blocked (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>Q).

The cancer cells were then divided into different groups with a contactless coculture system as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A. By detecting the expression of ERCC4 and the activity of STAT3, we confirmed the ability of our inhibitors to suppress STAT3 phosphorylation and ERCC4 transcription (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B and Fig.S5 C). We detected decreased expression of ERCC4 after CXCL14/CCR7/JAK2/STAT3 axis blockade and increased cleaved-caspase 3 and &#947;-H2AX expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). The proportion of &#947;H2AX-positive T24 cells under different treatment conditions indicated that DNA damage levels were significantly elevated when CXCL14 was absent or when CCR7/STAT3 was inhibited (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C, F). Comet assays conducted under alkaline conditions with 1 &#956;g/mL cisplatin demonstrated that disrupting any component of the CXCL14/CCR7/STAT3 signaling axis between CAFs and T24 cells effectively hindered the DNA damage repair process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D, G). We found that cancer cells cocultured with CAFs deficient in CXCL14 expression presented increased sensitivity to cisplatin. Additionally, the application of CCR7 or STAT3 inhibitors further reduced the development of chemoresistance, particularly at a cisplatin concentration of 1 &#956;g/mL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E and Fig.S5D). To further confirm the paracrine role of CXCL14 from CAFs in chemoresistance induction in bladder cancer cells, and to explore whether other signaling mechanisms, such as extracellular vesicles or direct contact, could exert similar effects, we cocultured T24 cells with shNC/shCXCL14 CAFs for 24 h (Fig.S5E). We subsequently sorted the CAFs via flow cytometry using PE-FAP and maintained the T24 cells to assess their sensitivity to cisplatin. However, no significant changes were observed in T24 cells cocultured with shCXCL14 CAFs (Fig. S5F). To investigate the in vivo effects of CXCL14 knockdown or blockade of the CXCL14/CCR7/STAT3 axis within the tumor microenvironment (TME), we coinjected CAFs and T24 cells, each with different shRNAs, subcutaneously into nude mice. This was followed by intraperitoneal injections of cisplatin combined with either CCR7i, STAT3i, or PBS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>H). Our findings demonstrated that CXCL14 knockdown in CAFs significantly enhanced tumor sensitivity to cisplatin, an effect that was also observed in the CCR7i and STAT3i groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>I and Fig. S5G). Moreover, the combination of CXCL14 knockdown in CAFs with ERCC4 knockdown in T24 cells resulted in the most substantial tumor growth inhibition. Additionally, ERCC4 knockdown in T24 cells alone increased the tumor sensitivity to cisplatin and reduced tumor burden in the bladder cancer model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>J).

To this end, we denatured the protein components in the supernatant at high temperatures and treated T24 cells with various inhibitors or shRNAs. The supernatant was then collected and applied to normal fibroblasts. Western blot analysis revealed that STAT3i and CCR7i effectively blocked the activation induced by the chemoresistant T24 supernatant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E). Additionally, the activated substance was found to be thermostable, suggesting that it is a metabolite rather than a protein signaling molecule. The Warburg effect, a defining characteristic of malignant tumor cell metabolism, is critically involved in tumor drug resistance. To further investigate whether the acidic microenvironment or glucose metabolites are responsible for the activation of NFs into CAFs, the pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 6.8 using hydrochloric acid to simulate an acidic microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Additionally, lactic acid and pyruvate were added as representative glucose metabolites for comparison. Western blot analysis and fibroblast contractility measurements demonstrated that lactate was the only metabolite capable of effectively inducing fibroblast activation and enhancing CXCL14 expression (Fig. S6A, B). Recent studies have shown that lactate produced by tumor cells can affect homeostasis, contribute to immunosuppression, and promote fibroblast activation within the TME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], but research on how chemoresistant cancer cells influence the activation of CAFs in bladder cancer is limited. To address this, we first examined the glucose consumption and lactate production rates of T24 cells under different fibroblast cocultures. The results indicated significantly elevated glycolytic levels in cells treated with CAF/CM (Fig. S6 C). Additionally, ECAR analysis revealed greater glycolytic activity and capacity in T24 cells indirectly cocultured with CAFs than in those cocultured with NFs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F, G). Fluorescently labelled glucose and lactate were utilized to further investigate changes in glucose metabolism and lactate utilization between different cell types. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D, T24 cells cocultured with NFs presented lower glucose uptake than those cocultured with CAFs did, while lactate absorption was significantly greater in CAFs than in NFs. Upon rhCXCL14 treatment, glucose uptake by T24 cells cocultured with NFs was significantly increased (Fig. S6 E), and NFs presented a slight increase in lactate absorption, although not as pronounced as in CAFs, possibly due to the limited treatment duration (Fig. S6 F). Conversely, CAFs co-cultured with T24 cells demonstrated reduced glucose uptake upon CCR7i application. These findings suggest that CXCL14 derived from CAFs enhances glucose uptake in T24 cells and that lactate reabsorption occurs not only in cancer cells but also in activated CAFs.</p><p id="Par47">To investigate the role of the CXCL14/CCR7/STAT3/ERCC4 axis in promoting glycolysis, we evaluated the effects of rhCXCL14, shERCC4, and various inhibitors on glycolytic activity. The results showed that rhCXCL14 enhanced glucose consumption and lactate production in T24 cells. Inhibition of STAT3 and CCR7, but not ERCC4, significantly mitigated these glycolytic changes and capacities (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>H, I and Fig. S6 G). To further elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms, we analysed key glycolytic enzymes in T24 and UM-UC-3 cells after 24 h of treatment with different CAF/CM. The results revealed that the aberrant overexpression of HK2 and LDHA was responsible for the increase in glycolysis observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>J, K). Consistently, rhCXCL14 treatment further increased HK2 and LDHA expression. This effect was suppressed by inhibiting STAT3 and CCR7, but not ERCC4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>L, M).</p><p id="Par48">Next, we examined whether enhanced glycolysis and lactate efflux in tumor cells are key drivers of fibroblast activation. When NFs were treated with exogenous lactate or conditioned medium from rhCXCL14-pretreated T24 cells, we observed a significant increase in fibroblast contractility (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>N, P) and &#945;-SMA expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>O). In contrast, fibroblast activation was markedly inhibited when glycolysis or STAT3 inhibitors were applied. These observations were further supported by RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses, which confirmed changes at both the transcriptional (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>R, S) and translational levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>Q).</p><p id="Par49">We cocultured NFs with CAFs directly or indirectly to determine whether CAFs can activate NFs independently of cancer cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that NFs did not undergo activation or CXCL14 expression induction, regardless of the coculture method (Fig. S6H, I).</p><p id="Par50">These results elucidate a mechanism whereby CAFs promote the activation of NFs by inducing aberrant glycolysis and lactate excretion in bladder cancer cells. Lactate produced by chemoresistant cancer cells not only enhances fibroblast activation and CXCL14 expression but also establishes a positive feedback loop that drives the development of chemoresistance within the TME.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par51">Cisplatin is a cornerstone first-line therapy for patients ineligible for surgery and is widely used to treat various cancers, including bladder cancer. However, resistance to cisplatin remains a major challenge and a significant cause of treatment failure, necessitating alternatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Emerging evidence underscores the pivotal role of CAFs in shaping the TME and driving tumor chemoresistance through the secretion of various factors. Targeting cytokines that contribute to resistance against platinum-based chemotherapy within the TME is a promising strategy to increase drug response rates in patients with bladder cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In our study, we isolated primary fibroblasts from clinical specimens and classified them as NFs or CAFs the basis of their origin and characteristics. We specifically focused on the overexpression and secretion of CXCL14 by CAFs, revealing its role in mediating NER responses in bladder cancer cells, which ultimately facilitates the development of chemoresistance.</p><p id="Par52">In the process of characterizing the subset of CAFs with CXCL14 overexpression, we noticed that they were mainly clustered in the iCAF and na&#239;ve-CAF subsets, which is also consistent with reports of prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. While we observed this effect in our study, it is important to note that the extracted CAFs were not further sorted, and the subtypes of CAFs and their subsequent characteristics will be further explored in our future experiments. CXCL14 is reported to play dual roles in cancer progression, and both its antitumor role and protumor role depend on the cancer type and source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Stromal CXCL14, but not tumor CXCL14, is reported to promote progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and CAF-secreted CXCL14 has been reported to promote tumor growth and invasion of breast and prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. While little is known about its role in bladder cancer, we observed prevalent expression of CXCL14 in bladder tissues, particularly within normal bladder epithelial cells. Conversely, CXCL14 was highly expressed in the tumor stroma, and CAFs obtained from chemoresistant patients presented elevated CXCL14 expression. Additionally, for the first time, we found that exogenous CXCL14 from CAFs could enhance the NER response of bladder cancer cells by upregulating ERCC4 expression.</p><p id="Par53">Eukaryotic cells possess DNA repair pathways that maintain genome stability; however, these mechanisms could also reduce the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer cells. Platinum-based chemotherapy primarily induces DNA damage to intrastrand G-G dimers, leading to distortion of the DNA helix, inhibition of replication and transcription, and ultimately, apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Abnormal DNA damage repair in tumor cells, particularly through the NER pathway, plays a central role in removing helix-distorting lesions, including ICLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. NER involves incisions by structure-specific endonucleases, resulting in excision and removal of a single-strand DNA fragment from the damaged DNA strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In our study, we observed transcriptional upregulation of ERCC4 in CXCL14-induced chemoresistant bladder cancer cells. ERCC4 is a versatile NER protein that functions by cleaving damaged DNA chains in the 5'region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Through the use of CAF/CM and exogenous recombinant proteins, we confirmed that CXCL14 enhanced ERCC4 transcription by the CCR7/STAT3 axis.</p><p id="Par54">Unlike members of the traditional chemokine family, the receptor targeted by CXCL14 is not well characterized. CXCR4, a commonly reported receptor for CXCL14, has been implicated in the regulation of tumor metastasis in renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Additionally, ACKR2 has been identified as a receptor for exogenous CXCL14 in lung and breast cancers, where it contributes to the activation of tumor cell invasion and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In our study, we observed that CXCL14 expression was significantly elevated in the stroma of bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent tissues, with a more pronounced increase in cisplatin-resistant tissues. These findings suggest that CXCL14 from CAFs may activate the NER response in bladder cancer cells, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. Notably, knocking down CXCR4, ACKR2, or ACKR3 did not significantly inhibit STAT3 activation or reduce ERCC4 expression. Through bioinformatics predictions combined with experimental validation, we identified a novel CXCL14 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor named CCR7, which appears to be a critical mediator of CAF-driven chemoresistance in bladder cancer cells. Consistent with this finding, the use of small molecule inhibitors to competitively inhibit CCR7 or its downstream effector STAT3 effectively suppressed CXCL14-mediated ERCC4 transcription.</p><p id="Par55">Given the complexity and bidirectionality of signaling interactions within the TME, we further explored whether CXCL14-induced chemoresistant bladder cancer cells contribute to fibroblast activation. Using a noncontact coculture system or supernatant alone, we observed significant activation of normal fibroblasts, which was accompanied by increased CXCL14 expression. To rule out efficiency components, we used high-temperature denaturation, revealing that metabolites, rather than proteins, were responsible for this activation. Given the important role of glucose metabolic reprogramming in tumor progression, the effects of glucose metabolites and the acidic microenvironment on NF activation were investigated. Our results demonstrated that the CXCL14/CCR7/STAT3 axis significantly promotes the glycolytic shift in bladder cancer cells by upregulating the expression of HK2 and LDHA, two key glycolytic enzymes. Furthermore, lactate generated via this signaling pathway effectively facilitates the transformation of normal fibroblasts into CAFs. Lactate has traditionally been regarded as the end product of glycolysis; however, emerging evidence highlights its role as both a carbon source for cellular metabolism and a signaling molecule within the TME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. On the one hand, lactate derived from CAFs can fuel breast cancer cell growth or enhance lipid metabolic reprogramming, thereby facilitating cancer metastasis, which often referred to as the reversed &#8220;Warburg&#8221; effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. On the other hand, as the primary source of lactate within the TME, cancer cells secrete large amounts of lactate to create an acidic microenvironment that suppresses immune cell infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Fibroblasts reuse this lactate, especially under conditions of nutrient restriction induced by tumor cells, to promote their activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Lactate derived from lung cancer cells can be taken up by CAFs, leading to their activation and subsequent recruitment of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. With the use of C13-labelled metabolic flux analysis, Bhagat et al. revealed that lactate produced by glycolytic pancreatic cancer cells is absorbed and further metabolized by CAFs, resulting in increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels and decreased 5-methylcytosine levels, ultimately driving CAF activation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Our study has several limitations in this regard. We did not further investigate the precise mechanisms underlying lactate-induced CAF activation, but we observed an association between CAF activation and increased lactate absorption. The involvement of lactate transporters, such as those in the MCT family, in regulating lactate uptake and their potential role in modulating fibroblast activation remain to be fully elucidated. Addressing this question will be a key focus of our future research.</p><p id="Par56">In conclusion, we elucidated a mechanism by which CAFs contribute to chemoresistance in bladder cancer cells through CXCL14 paracrine signaling&#160;(Scheme <xref rid="Sch1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Specifically, CXCL14 activates the CCR7/JAK2/STAT3 axis, leading to the upregulation of ERCC4 transcription, which promotes DNA damage repair in bladder cancer cells, thereby facilitating the development of chemoresistance. Additionally, exogenous CXCL14 upregulates HK2/LDHA expression via STAT3 activation, resulting in lactate efflux which further converts normal fibroblasts into CAFs. We also demonstrated that small molecule inhibitors, including the STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 and the CCR7 inhibitor Cmp2105, effectively block the development of drug resistance by targeting different points within the CXCL14/CCR7/JAK2/STAT3 axis, both in vitro and in vivo. This inhibition shows potential for enhancing the efficacy of tumor chemotherapy and offers a novel therapeutic strategy for clinical application.<fig id="Sch1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Scheme 1</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram</p></caption><graphic id="MO2" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="13046_2025_3487_Sch1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec240" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
