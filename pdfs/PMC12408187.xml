Emerging evidence revealed the colonization of microbial communities in multiple anatomical sites previously considered sterile under homeostatic conditions. However, the mechanistic relationship between compromised intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and subsequent translocation of gut-resident bacteria into systemic circulation has yet to be comprehensively elucidated.</p><p><bold>Hypothesis/Gap Statement.</bold> Under intestinal leakage, gut micro-organisms can break through the intestinal barrier and then translocate to other organs.</p><p><bold>Aim.</bold> This study investigates the distribution of micro-organisms in healthy organisms to determine whether gut bacteria translocate to sterile organs only under the condition of intestinal leakage using GFP-labelled <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> (GFP-<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>) tracing.</p><p><bold>Methodology.</bold> Female C57BL/6&#8201;mice (5 weeks old) were administered either a glacial acetic acid enema [inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) group] or a sterile normal saline enema [normal control (NC) group]. All mice were subsequently gavaged with GFP-<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>. HE staining and Alcian blue staining were performed to evaluate the colon injury. The expression levels of intestinal tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) were tested by reverse transcription quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence staining. The distribution of GFP-<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> in multiple organs was assessed through bacterial culture, confocal microscopy and PCR.</p><p><bold>Results.</bold> In the IBD mice, mucopolysaccharide accumulation levels (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.01) and tight junction proteins ZO-1 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.001) and occludin (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.01) in the colon were significantly decreased compared with the NC group. Bacterial culture showed that there was no GFP-<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> in the blood, heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys or oviducts of normal mice, while the number of GFP-<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> colonies in the blood (219&#8201;c.f.u.&#8201;ml<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), liver (2.39&#215;10<sup>5</sup>&#8201;c.f.u.&#8201;ml<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and lungs (2.50&#215;10<sup>8</sup>&#8201;c.f.u.&#8201;ml<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) of the IBD mice was significantly higher than that of the NC group. The confocal microscopy and PCR results also showed that the number of GFP-<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> in the liver and lungs of the IBD group was significantly higher than that of the NC group (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusion.</bold> Healthy mice maintain a sterile microenvironment in the blood, heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys and oviducts. However, compromised intestinal barrier integrity facilitates microbial translocation from the intestinal lumen into the blood, liver and lungs. This study advances our understanding of endogenous infections caused by IBD, demonstrating the crucial role of intestinal permeability in bacterial infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bacterial translocation</kwd><kwd>GFP-labelled <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic></kwd><kwd>intestinal leakage</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Shanxi Provincial Natural Fund Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>202203021211239</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Applicable</surname><given-names>Not</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013794</institution-id></institution-wrap><institution>Shanxi Provincial Education Department</institution></funding-source><award-id>BYJL045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Weiping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Shanxi Province, China</institution></funding-source><award-id>20230225</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Weiping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Data Summary</title><p>The authors confirm that all supporting data and protocols have been provided in the article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s2"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is generally accepted that commensal microbiota predominantly colonize the distal ends of the lumens that communicate with the outside, such as the oral cavity, the intestine, the anus of the digestive tract, the nasopharynx of the respiratory tract and certain parts of the urogenital tract [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In contrast, the internal solid organs (heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys) are conventionally considered to be microbially sterile under homeostatic conditions. However, recent evidence has demonstrated the presence of microbial communities in traditionally presumed sterile human tissues, including liver, uterus and placenta [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We assume that the key of the dispute lies in the permeability of the intestinal wall. That is, under conditions of intestinal leakage, gut micro-organisms can break through the intestinal barrier, enter the blood through the portal vein and then translocate to organs throughout the body [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) serves as a paradigmatic model for studying microbial translocation due to its characteristic disruption of intestinal barrier integrity and induction of increased intestinal permeability [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

Early research predominantly supported the idea that organs are sterile. Qin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] developed a model that suggested a &#8216;pure&#8217; internal environment in healthy individuals. Based on the technological capabilities of the time, he suggested that vital organs &#8211; including the heart and liver &#8211; were devoid of microbial life. However, advances in detection methods have challenged this paradigm. Acharya and Bajaj [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] used highly sensitive techniques to identify distinct microbial communities residing in organs such as the liver and lungs. These findings have fundamentally overturned the traditional view of organ sterility and reshaped our understanding of microbial distribution in healthy organisms.</p><p>In this study, we systematically tracked the distribution of GFP-<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> in mice and compared microbial translocation patterns between healthy individuals and those with induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. The results showed that GFP-<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> remained exclusively localized to the intestinal lumen in control mice, with no detectable colonization in systemic tissues &#8211; including blood, heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys or reproductive organs. This is consistent with established theories of intact intestinal barrier function under physiological conditions [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, mice with experimentally induced leaky gut exhibited significant GFP-<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> translocation, with increased bacterial loads detected in blood, liver and lungs. These findings demonstrate that IBD-associated barrier dysfunction increases intestinal permeability, facilitating bacterial migration from the gut lumen to extraintestinal organs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This mechanistic link between intestinal barrier dysfunction and microbial translocation supports existing models of gut-derived bacteraemia [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><title>The mechanism of intestinal barrier dysfunction leading to microbial translocation. Note: The mice were randomly divided into NC and IBD groups. The mice were given either a normal saline enema (NC) or a glacial acetic acid enema (IBD). Both groups were then given GFP-<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> by gavage. The results showed that there was no change in the expression of colonic mucopolysaccharides and tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin in the NC group, while the expression of colonic mucopolysaccharides and tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin was significantly reduced in the IBD group, which led to an increase in the permeability of the colon, and the GFP-<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> in the IBD mice was translocated through the colon and reached the liver and lungs via the blood circulation.</title></caption><graphic position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="jmm-74-02054-g003.jpg"/></fig><p>GFP-<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> provided a visual demonstration of the process by which <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> breaches intestinal defences and progressively invades distant organs via the circulatory system. In mice with induced intestinal barrier dysfunction (leaky gut), bacteria and their by-products can travel through the portal vein to the liver, disrupting its relatively stable microecological and metabolic environment [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, Dickson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported that gut-derived micro-organisms can breach the respiratory mucosal barrier and migrate to the lungs. These findings underscore the significance of our study in elucidating bacterial translocation pathways and provide deeper insights into the gut&#8211;liver axis and gut&#8211;lung axis, supporting the hypothesis that gut dysbiosis influences systemic inflammatory networks, aligning with Mousa <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] proposal of a link between gut dysbiosis and systemic diseases.</p><p>Current research on bacterial translocation following intestinal barrier disruption is predominantly focused on the gut microbiota at a community level [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These studies aim to elucidate how structural and compositional changes in microbial populations correlate with pathogen dissemination during barrier compromise. While our investigation adopts a targeted approach, using GFP-<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> to map precise translocation routes and unravel the mechanistic basis of bacterial pathogenicity. Traditional methods for detecting bacterial translocation &#8211; such as culture-based assays and PCR &#8211; have critical limitations. These techniques provide only static, end-point data with limited spatio-temporal resolution, limiting their ability to capture dynamic dissemination processes. The GFP-tracking system overcomes these limitations by enabling real-time visualization of bacterial migration, in line with emerging paradigms for spatial microbial dynamics proposed by Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>While this work provides novel insights into <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> translocation dynamics, several limitations warrant consideration. First, although GFP labelling enabled real-time visualization of bacterial migration, resolving the precise spatio-temporal details of translocation events (e.g. subcellular interactions or transient vascular adherence) requires integration with advanced imaging modalities. Super-resolution microscopy, high-speed live imaging and single-cell tracking systems could refine our understanding of critical translocation timelines and organ-specific invasion routes [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, our focus on <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> as a model organism inherently overlooks the complexity of gut microbiota interactions. <italic toggle="yes">In vivo</italic>, bacterial translocation is likely to involve synergistic or antagonistic crosstalk between microbial communities and dynamics. For instance, shifts in commensal populations may either facilitate or inhibit the spread of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>. Therefore, it is difficult to comprehensively uncover the intrinsic relevance of bacterial translocation by studying only a single bacterium, which is contrary to the view of the overall role of the bacterial community [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Finally, the acetic acid-induced mouse model of IBD differs substantially from human IBD in both pathogenesis and pathological manifestations, lacking the chronic progression, multifactorial complexity and patient-specific heterogeneity characteristic of clinical cases. Consequently, integrating complementary approaches &#8211; including genetically engineered models and microbiota-based systems &#8211; provides a more physiologically relevant framework for studying human IBD pathophysiology.</p><p>In summary, our findings demonstrate that healthy mice exhibit no systemic colonization by <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>, whereas mice with intestinal barrier dysfunction (leaky gut) show significant bacterial translocation to the bloodstream, liver and lungs. This provides vital insights into how leaky gut facilitates microbial dissemination. By visualizing spatio-temporal dynamics of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> migration via GFP tracking, current research continues to elucidate the gut&#8211;liver and gut&#8211;lung axes, demonstrating how intestinal damage drives multi-organ dysfunction in IBD. These findings align with known associations between gut dysbiosis and systemic pathologies [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Future studies integrating multi-species models and advanced imaging technologies may further unravel the complex interplay between gut integrity, microbial communities and systemic health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SF1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1099/jmm.0.002054</object-id><label>Uncited Fig. S1.</label><media xlink:href="jmm-74-02054-s001.pdf" id="d67e763" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was supported by the College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Shanxi Province, China (grant no. 20230225); the Shanxi Province Higher Education &#8216;Billion Project&#8217; Science and Technology Guidance Project (BYJL045); and the Shanxi Provincial Natural Fund Project (202203021211239).
