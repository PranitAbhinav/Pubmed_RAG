Approximately 39.9 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2023, 65% of whom are in the African Region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly improved the longevity of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and has dramatically reduced the rate of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since the advent of HAART, MTCT rates have plummeted to less than 2%. However, the effectiveness of HAART, like any medication, hinges on the intrinsic properties of the drugs and the individual's adherence to the prescribed regimen. Achieving viral suppression is essential to minimize the risk of transmitting HIV to the baby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite this effectiveness, non-adherence to HAART remains a barrier to achieving its maximum benefits, especially that of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Globally, adherence to ART among pregnant women varies widely, ranging from 35% to 93.5%, reflecting differences in healthcare access, social support, and adherence interventions across different settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In Africa, a study covering multiple regions found that 19.8% of women exhibited suboptimal ART adherence, with significant regional variations&#8212;18.0% in Eastern Africa and 32.8% in Western Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In Ethiopia, a study reported that 83.2% of pregnant women had good adherence to ART for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), indicating that 16.8% were non-adherent. The most commonly cited reasons for non-adherence in Ethiopia included forgetfulness (79%) and being busy (71%), emphasizing the need for targeted interventions such as adherence counseling and reminder systems to improve ART uptake among pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) means the extent to which a person's behavior&#8212;taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes&#8212;corresponds with agreed recommendations from a healthcare provider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. High levels of adherence are crucial for the effectiveness of ART, as they help maintain viral suppression, improve immune function, and reduce the risk of HIV transmission and drug resistance. The WHO emphasizes that adherence rates of at least 95% are necessary to achieve optimal outcomes. This means that patients must take their medication correctly and consistently, adhering to prescribed dosages and schedules, to ensure that the virus remains undetectable and the treatment remains effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">According to recent global estimates by UNAIDS, 82% of pregnant women living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) to prevent vertical transmission of HIV, resulting in an estimated 220,000 infants being born HIV-free. Despite these successes, an estimated 130,000 children under the age of 15 acquired HIV in 2022, highlighting the critical importance of ART adherence in preventing vertical transmission of HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy among pregnant women poses a significant challenge in managing HIV and ensuring maternal and infant health. ART is crucial for controlling viral loads and preventing the transmission of HIV from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth. However, adherence can be particularly difficult for pregnant women due to several factors that lead to uncontrolled viral loads, increasing the risk of HIV transmission to the infant during pregnancy, labor, or breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This elevated viral presence also heightens the likelihood of the mother experiencing complications such as opportunistic infections or progression to AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Non-adherence poses serious risks to both maternal and fetal health, making it a critical public health concern. However, most existing research on ART adherence among pregnant women in Ethiopia has focused on major urban centers like Addis Ababa, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] with limited data available from Dessie Town and its surrounding areas. Given the regional disparities in healthcare access and socio-cultural beliefs, a location-specific analysis is essential to understand the unique barriers affecting adherence in this setting. Furthermore, there is a lack of research evaluating the impact of key health system interventions, such as participation in mother-support groups, which play a crucial role in improving adherence and providing psychosocial support. To address these gaps, this study aims to identify the determinants of ART non-adherence among pregnant women attending Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) follow-up services in health facilities in Dessie Town, South Wollo, Ethiopia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method and materials</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study setting, period, study design, and population</title><p id="Par20">A facility-based unmatched Case&#8211;control study was undertaken from August 2022 to August 2023 at Dessie town public health facilities, South Wollo, Ethiopia, which is located 401 km from Ethiopia's capital city, Addis Ababa. According to the town administrative health office report, the town had 10 urban and 6 rural kebeles with an estimated population of 218,471 people, with 102,378 (46.86%) males and 116,093 (53.14%) females. Women of reproductive age constituted 51,870 (23.7%) of the total population. There were five hospitals (two government and three private), eight health centers (three of which provided ART services), and twenty-seven private clinics. This study involved two hospitals (DCSH and Boru Meda) and three health centers (Hote, Segno Gebeya, and Buanbua Wuha) Health centers. The selection of health facilities for this study was based on service availability and patient load to ensure the reliability and relevance of the data. Priority was given to facilities that offer both ART services and maternal healthcare, as these are essential for addressing key public health concerns. Additionally, institutions with higher patient flow were preferred, as they provided a more diverse patient population and a larger dataset, enhancing the study's validity. Furthermore, since ART services are provided free of charge in government healthcare institutions, the majority of patients seek care in these settings. This approach ensured that the selected facilities were well-equipped to provide comprehensive insights into healthcare service delivery within the study area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par21"><italic toggle="yes">Cases</italic>: included pregnant women on ART who were non-adherent and accessible during data collection, while <italic toggle="yes">controls</italic> comprised adherent pregnant women on ART who were accessible throughout the data collection period.

The first two variables (occupation and treatment supporter) in the table below were obtained from a study conducted in Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The next two variables (age and monthly income) and the last variable (rural residence) were taken from the study done in southern and eastern Ethiopia respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The variable that has been found to yield a larger sample size was then employed. From the selected health facility in the study area, there were 265(68 cases and 198 controls) pregnant mothers on ART.

A long-term commitment to adherence lowers the risk of developing opportunistic infections, prevents disease transmission, and helps to maintain adequate viral load suppression.</p><p id="Par48">One of the key indicators significantly linked to ART non-adherence among HIV-positive pregnant women is the lack of participation in mother support groups. Women who did not join these groups were 3.3 times more likely to be non-adherent to ART compared to those who did participate. This difference may be due to the multifaceted benefits these groups provide. These support groups offer a sense of community and shared experience, reducing feelings of isolation and stigma that can be significant barriers to adherence. Through peer support, women receive encouragement, practical advice, and emotional backing, which enhances their motivation and commitment to maintaining their ART regimen. Additionally, mother support groups often provide education on the importance of ART adherence for both maternal health and the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, empowering women with knowledge and resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This outcome is consistent with research done in southern Uganda, Ghana, and South Africa where support groups similarly contribute to improved adherence. However, differences exist in their roles: Uganda integrates economic empowerment initiatives, Ghana emphasizes home visits and family involvement, and South Africa leverages digital health interventions and advocacy, while Ethiopia primarily relies on peer support within healthcare settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">In terms of WHO clinical stages, pregnant women on ART who had clinical stages III &amp; IV had a 2.7-fold higher chance of non-adherence than those who had clinical stages I &amp; II. This result is in line with research from Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This may stem from the heightened severity and complexity of symptoms in advanced HIV stages. Patients often face physical and psychological challenges, such as opportunistic infections and neurological complications, which complicate adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, some studies have found conflicting results, suggesting that women with advanced disease may actually have higher adherence due to frequent medical follow-ups and closer monitoring of viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These differences may be explained by variations in healthcare access and support systems across different regions in Ethiopia. Early diagnosis and timely initiation of ART could help prevent disease progression and improve adherence rates.</p><p id="Par50">In contrast, patients in stages I and II often experience milder symptoms and have a better overall health status, making it easier for them to maintain a regular ART regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Furthermore, respondents who forgot to take ART drugs were 2.4 times more likely to be non-adherent than their counterparts. This result is comparable to the study done in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. ART often requires a strict schedule for maximum effectiveness, and missing doses can compromise treatment outcomes and lead to drug resistance. When individuals forget to take their medication, they disrupt this critical schedule, which can result in suboptimal viral suppression and treatment failure. Unlike other factors such as stigma or side effects, which may be addressed through counseling or medical intervention, forgetfulness requires systematic solutions, such as reminders or pill organizers, to effectively manage adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">The current study also discovered that opportunistic infection prophylaxis was substantially related to non-adherence to ART in HIV-positive pregnant mothers. According to this study, participants who did not get opportunistic infection prophylaxis were 3.9 times more likely to non-adhere than those who did, which is corroborated by a study done in Addis Ababa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This might be due to the fact that without prophylaxis, these women are at a higher risk of developing opportunistic infections, which can lead to frequent illness, hospitalization, and overall poor health. These complications can disrupt their daily routines, making it challenging to consistently take ART as prescribed. The physical and psychological burden of managing multiple health issues without the preventive benefits of prophylaxis can diminish their capacity and motivation to adhere to ART. Additionally, the absence of regular medical oversight that typically accompanies prophylaxis can result in a lack of continuous education and reinforcement about the importance of ART adherence, further contributing to non-adherence. In contrast, women who receive opportunistic infection prophylaxis are generally healthier, better supported, and more informed, which facilitates consistent ART adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Chemoprophylaxis was advised in the Ethiopian national programs to prevent the incidence of opportunistic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">In this study, the determinant factor for ART non-adherence among HIV-positive pregnant mothers. The odds of being non-adherent among those mothers who did not disclose their HIV status to their parents or spouses were 2.9 times more likely to be non-adherent than those who disclosed their HIV status. This is in line with the study done in Tigray, northern Ethiopia, and Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. When individuals do not inform their spouses about their HIV status, they often experience heightened stress and anxiety about the potential discovery, leading to a clandestine approach to taking medication. This secrecy can cause them to miss doses or take their medication inconsistently, fearing their partner's reaction if the medication is discovered. Notably, in Dessie Town, non-disclosure rates are higher than in other regions, possibly due to deep-rooted cultural stigmas, fear of marital dissolution, and lower awareness of HIV-related rights. Studies from Addis Ababa suggest higher disclosure rates, likely due to stronger community sensitization programs and greater access to psychosocial support services. Strengthening community-based stigma reduction programs and confidential disclosure counseling may help mitigate these challenges, particularly in urban centers like Dessie, where social stigma remains a significant barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Without open communication and support from their partner, the individual may struggle with feelings of isolation and the overwhelming responsibility of managing their treatment alone. In contrast, those who disclose their status to their partners can benefit from a supportive and cooperative relationship, where the partner can assist with reminders, provide emotional support, and create an environment that encourages consistent ART adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. According to WHO, pregnant women in Sub-Saharan Africa have the lowest rate of HIV disclosure globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Fear of disclosing one's HIV status to partners, family, or the community remains a major barrier to treatment adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">The odds of being non-adherence among participants with unplanned pregnancies were 3.045 times more likely to be non-adherent than those with planned pregnancies.

Additionally, the emotional and psychological adjustments required during an unplanned pregnancy may overshadow the importance of adhering to treatment plans, leading to higher rates of non-compliance.

These determinants highlight the complex interplay of medical, social, and psychological challenges that impede adherence to ART, ultimately jeopardizing the health of both mothers and their infants and increasing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Recommendations</title><p id="Par59">Increase the availability and accessibility of mother support groups to offer emotional, informational, and practical support to HIV-positive pregnant women, thereby encouraging adherence to ART.</p><p id="Par60">Develop supportive environments and counseling services that promote the safe disclosure of HIV status, reduce stigma, and improve adherence to ART.</p><p id="Par61">Provide comprehensive reproductive health services, including family planning and counseling, to prevent unintended pregnancies and mitigate their impact on ART adherence.</p><p id="Par62">Ensure that all HIV-positive pregnant women receive and adhere to prophylactic treatments for opportunistic infections.</p><p id="Par63">Implement reminder systems, such as mobile health technologies, pill organizers, and regular follow-up visits, to help women remember to take their medication.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AIDS</term><def><p id="Par6">Acquired Human Immune Deficiency Virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ART</term><def><p id="Par7">Anti-Retro Viral Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAART</term><def><p id="Par8">Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p id="Par9">Human Immune Deficiency Virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MTCT</term><def><p id="Par10">Mother-to-Child Transmission</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OI</term><def><p id="Par11">Opportunistic Infection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PMTCT</term><def><p id="Par12">Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPSS</term><def><p id="Par13">Statistically Package for Social Science</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par14">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all ART clients who provided their consent and participated in this study.
