Few therapies have been identified that can modulate these injurious pathways following AKI. Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is an immune regulator expressed in the kidney and a potential therapeutic target for AKI. The effect of the selective SYK inhibitor entospletinib was studied in AKI-to-CKD transition. Entospletinib was administered to mice undergoing unilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), with kidneys analyzed over 14 days. Single-cell RNA sequencing, digital spatial profiling, intravital microscopy, and flow cytometry were employed to study renal phenotypes. Entospletinib administered before and after IRI protected ischemic kidneys and significantly attenuated the transition to CKD. Entospletinib targeted leukocyte-expressed SYK and prevented neutrophil/monocyte recruitment to the kidney. Entospletinib reduced nonresolving tubulointerstitial inflammation after AKI by blocking activation of mannose receptor-1&#8211; and C-type lectin domain family 7 member A&#8211;expressing proinflammatory macrophages. The resolution of renal inflammation mediated by entospletinib was associated with a reciprocal increase in resident macrophages, reparative gene expression, preserved tubular integrity, and reduced renal fibrosis. The SYK inhibitor entospletinib resolves renal inflammation and promotes repair following AKI.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p>

Aside from supportive care, currently there are no specific therapies available for AKI (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Patients with AKI from a variety of causes such as sepsis or ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) are at increased risk of progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD), a process termed AKI-to-CKD transition (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Tubular injury and persistent or nonresolving renal inflammation that follow severe AKI results in maladaptive repair, loss of functional tissue, and excessive ECM deposition that leads to CKD (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The development of CKD after AKI further increases the risk of adverse patient outcomes, such as end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and death (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Kidney repair is a complex biological process that is activated during injury to resolve inflammation, maintain cellular integrity, and enhance cellular regeneration to preserve kidney structure and function. Virtually all cell types in the kidney participate in repair, including tubular epithelium, endothelium, stroma, and leukocytes (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). While inflammation contributes to kidney injury, leukocytes, in particular macrophages, are essential to promote renal repair (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Both resident and recruited renal macrophages display plasticity during injury and can switch from a proinflammatory to an antiinflammatory and reparative phenotype based on signals derived within the injured renal microenvironment. We and others have characterized many of the factors that regulate this phenotypic switch, including cytokines, growth factors, and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from injured tubular cells, perivascular and other interstitial stromal cells, as well as macrophages themselves (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Despite these studies, it is evident that kidney macrophages exist on a spectrum with overlapping cell surface markers and functions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), decreasing the likelihood that therapeutic targeting of distinct macrophage populations could be achieved to improve renal outcomes after AKI. Rather, altering the balance between kidney inflammation and repair may be a more effective strategy to shape the phenotype of the AKI-to-CKD transition. Potential therapies for AKI targeting injury prevention and/or early events such as acute inflammation or tubular cell death have been reported (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>); however, few clinically viable pharmacologic agents have been identified that can modulate post-AKI pathways that drive nonresolving inflammation or kidney repair.</p><p>Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is a non&#8211;receptor tyrosine kinase highly expressed in hematopoietic cells and involved in various biological functions, including cellular adhesion, immune recognition, and vascular development (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). SYK exerts its actions downstream of B cell, Fc&#947;, and C-type lectin receptors. Several SYK inhibitors such as fostamatinib and entospletinib are under clinical development primarily for hematologic disorders and B lymphocyte malignancies, with fostamatinib being first approved for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In the kidney, SYK is expressed in resident and recruited myeloid cells such as macrophages and to a much lesser degree in parenchyma such as tubular cells, mesangial cells, and interstitial myofibroblasts (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). SYK has been shown to participate in the pathogenesis of nonimmune experimental renal injury. For example, following IRI in mice, SYK regulates the recruitment and activation of proinflammatory neutrophils and macrophages. Pharmacologic inhibition of SYK using compounds such as CC-0417 and BAY61-3606 diminished IRI-induced acute renal inflammation and tubular injury, with reduced leukocyte recruitment and a downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1&#946;, TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and CCL2 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Mice with SYK-deficient myeloid cells display a similar phenotype to those treated with pharmacologic inhibitors, suggesting the SYK exerts the majority of its effects in leukocytes during kidney injury (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Consistent with these reports, C-type lectin domain family 4 member E (CLEC4E, Mincle) signaling via SYK was shown in several studies to mediate acute inflammation during experimental AKI (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Finally, SYK was found to be highly expressed in renal macrophages following unilateral ureteric obstruction in mice. SYK inhibition with CC-0417 significantly reduced inflammation and fibrosis in this model (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Thus, the existing evidence shows that SYK participates in both renal inflammation and fibrosis, establishing it as a potential therapeutic target for both AKI and CKD.</p><p>Entospletinib is a second-generation, selective, and potent SYK inhibitor that is currently in clinical development for hematologic malignancies with a favorable short-term safety profile (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In this study, entospletinib-mediated renoprotection was used as a model to interrogate inflammation and repair pathways in mice undergoing IRI and AKI-to-CKD transition. Entospletinib significantly attenuated AKI-to-CKD transition, with its major effect in resident and recruited leukocyte populations. Importantly, entospletinib blocked proinflammatory signaling in macrophages expressing the SYK-dependent receptors macrophage mannose receptor-1 (CD206) and C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (CLEC7A) that resolved inflammation and enhanced kidney repair pathways. These data identify SYK as a mediator of nonresolving renal inflammation and entospletinib as a potential therapeutic agent to mitigate AKI-to-CKD transition in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Entospletinib protects against AKI-to-CKD transition.</title><p>To explore the impact of entospletinib on AKI-to-CKD transition, we employed a model of maladaptive repair induced by unilateral renal IRI. Mice were administered intraperitoneal injections of entospletinib (20 mg/kg) or vehicle (DMSO) 30 minutes prior to IRI of the left kidney without contralateral nephrectomy. At this dose in mice, entospletinib is approximately 10-fold lower than the human equivalent dose based on allometric scaling and reached a peak plasma concentration of 1.69 &#956;M at 6 hours following a single intraperitoneal injection, which is near the drug EC<sub>50</sub> and less likely to cause off-target effects (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>, A and B; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.189601DS1" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.189601DS1</ext-link>). Treatment continued with daily injections for the first 6 days, followed by injections every other day until 14 days (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1C</xref>). In this unilateral IRI model, survival was 100% after 14 days, with no significant changes in body weight (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1D</xref>). Periodic acid&#8211;Schiff (PAS) staining of contralateral kidneys indicated that entospletinib did not affect normal renal architecture (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, entospletinib displayed minimal impact on primary human tubular epithelial cells, with no cell death observed following 24 hours of drug exposure (1 &#956;M) in vitro (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>, F and G). Thus, consistent with the clinical experience, short-term administration of entospletinib does not cause renal toxicity in mice.</p><p>Immunoblotting of whole kidney lysates confirmed SYK expression and phosphorylation at Y519/520 one day after IRI, which was diminished by entospletinib treatment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, A and B</xref>), confirming that the drug effectively targeted SYK in the kidney. On days 7 and 14 after IRI, macroscopic changes were evident in ischemic kidneys from vehicle-treated mice, with renal size (expressed as weight) reduced by approximately 25% and 44%, respectively, compared with contralateral uninjured kidneys (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). PAS staining revealed increased inflammatory infiltrates and persistent tubular injury after IRI, characterized by the absence of brush borders, tubular cell flattening, and cast formation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, D and E</xref>). The number of glomeruli per unit area was also increased as an indicator of kidney parenchymal loss and tubular atrophy (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>) (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In comparison, ischemic kidneys from entospletinib-treated mice were larger and displayed improved histopathologic findings, with reduced tubular injury and atrophy.</p><p>Entospletinib also reduced renal fibrosis after IRI. As expected, kidneys on day 1 after IRI stained negative for fibrosis using Masson&#8217;s trichrome staining, despite tubular injury. By days 7 and 14, renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis increased in ischemic kidneys from vehicle-treated mice, indicating AKI-to-CKD transition (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Quantification revealed that entospletinib significantly reduced renal fibrosis area compared with vehicle-treated mice (6.74% &#177; 0.71% vehicle vs. 2.40% &#177; 0.55% entospletinib on day 7 and 13.00% &#177; 1.51% vehicle vs. 3.96% &#177; 1.05% entospletinib on day 14) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Fibrosis was also assessed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. &#945;-Smooth muscle actin (&#945;SMA) protein expression and &#945;SMA<sup>+</sup> cells increased in the kidneys of vehicle-treated mice at 7 and 14 days after IRI in direct correlation with area of fibrosis, a response that was effectively inhibited by entospletinib (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, C&#8211;F</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether entospletinib was effective in established AKI (the more common clinical presentation in humans), the drug was initiated in mice at 24 hours after injury. At 14 days, mice treated with entospletinib displayed larger kidneys compared with vehicle-treated ischemic controls (kidney weight reduction ~40% control vs. 20% entospletinib) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Consistent with the improved gross kidney changes, entospletinib-treated mice also showed reduced histopathologic tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, B&#8211;D</xref>). Collectively, these data show that the SYK inhibitor entospletinib prevents IRI-induced AKI-to-CKD transition. Importantly, entospletinib is also effective when given after AKI, suggesting that it modulates pathways beyond the acute phase of kidney injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Entospletinib promotes tubular integrity.</title><p>To better characterize the phenotypic changes induced by entospletinib treatment in the tubular compartment during IRI, digital spatial profiling (DSP) using the GeoMx platform was employed. Kidney sections from vehicle- or entospletinib-treated mice on days 1, 7, and 14 after IRI were stained with anti-IBA1 (macrophages), anti-panCK, and anti-CD10 (tubular cells) to identify renal compartments and subsequent cell segregation (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). The specificity of IBA1 and panCK/CD10 markers to differentiate between macrophage and tubular cell populations was confirmed by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). Eighty-seven regions of interest (ROI) containing 12,661 cells were selected from both the cortex and medulla. Cells were then segregated according to their antibody label (areas of illumination, AOIs) followed by whole transcriptome sequencing of the 2 populations. Differential gene expression between IBA1- and panCK/CD10-defined AOIs confirmed good separation of macrophage and tubular cell compartments using this approach (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref> File 1). Differential gene expression analysis was next performed in panCK/CD10-defined segments to determine the effects of entospletinib on tubular phenotype following kidney injury. Few differentially expressed genes were detected in the tubular compartment of ischemic kidneys between vehicle- and entospletinib-treated mice on day 1 after IRI (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>). On days 7 and 14 after IRI, genes associated with &#8220;immune response,&#8221; &#8220;cell adhesion,&#8221; &#8220;cytokine-mediated signaling pathways,&#8221; &#8220;wound healing,&#8221; and &#8220;extracellular structure organization&#8221; were upregulated in ischemic kidneys of control mice, while genes related to &#8220;fatty acid metabolic process&#8221; and &#8220;generation of precursor metabolites and energy&#8221; were downregulated (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, entospletinib reversed the phenotype, upregulating genes linked to &#8220;fatty acid metabolic process&#8221; and &#8220;generation of precursor metabolites and energy&#8221; while downregulating genes associated with inflammation and &#8220;extracellular structure organization&#8221; (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, A&#8211;D</xref>). To further assess the effect of entospletinib on the tubular phenotype during AKI-to-CKD transition, the expression of genes associated with homeostasis and injury was compared (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Over 14 days, IRI induced the upregulation of injury genes such as <italic toggle="yes">Havcr1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Vcam1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Egfr</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Lgals1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Lgals3</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Aoc1</italic>, profibrotic genes <italic toggle="yes">Ccn2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Vim</italic>, inflammatory genes <italic toggle="yes">Csf1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Ccl2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Il1b</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Cxcl2</italic>, and downregulated epithelial homeostatic genes <italic toggle="yes">Lrp2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Egf</italic> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, E&#8211;I</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>). Although gene expression profiles were generally similar between the cortex and medulla, inflammatory and profibrotic genes tended to be higher in the medulla, which in this analysis included the outer medullary stripe. In contrast, treatment with entospletinib reduced the expression of all tubular injury&#8211;associated, profibrotic and proinflammatory genes while upregulating <italic toggle="yes">Lrp2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Egf</italic> to levels approaching uninjured control kidneys (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, E&#8211;I</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>). Thus, in keeping with the improved pathologic findings, these results show that entospletinib prevents the molecular phenotype of AKI-to-CKD transition, while preserving a signature of intact tubules.</p></sec><sec><title>Syk is expressed by leukocytes in the kidney.</title><p>Previous studies have identified SYK as mainly leukocyte expressed in kidney IRI (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).

Since leukocytes are a likely target of entospletinib, scRNA-seq data were further analyzed to understand the effect of the drug on renal inflammation following IRI. Under normal conditions, the mouse kidney contains only a few monocytes and neutrophils (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 12</xref>, A and B). On day 1 following IRI in vehicle-treated mice, the number of these leukocytes increased in the kidney. As AKI progressed to CKD, the number of neutrophils remained elevated at 14 days (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 12C</xref>).

Cell-to-cell communication inference using CellPhoneDB, with parenchymal cells as the source and monocytes/neutrophils as the target, revealed that <italic toggle="yes">Cd44</italic> on neutrophils and monocytes matched with several ECM genes expressed by tubular cells, such as <italic toggle="yes">Spp1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Timp3</italic>, and several collagen and laminin genes such as <italic toggle="yes">Col1a1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Col6a3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Col4a1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Lama3</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Lamc1</italic> (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 13</xref>).

Contralateral and uninjured kidneys showed very few adherent GFP<sup>+</sup> leukocytes. Following IRI, significant recruitment of large GFP<sup>+</sup> leukocytes was observed in the tubulointerstitial area of injured kidneys, with adherent and crawling cells present within peritubular capillaries and directly along tubules, consistent with the transcriptomic and computational analysis (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, D and E</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Video 1</xref>). In contrast, entospletinib significantly reduced the number of infiltrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the kidney. In treated mice, the few GFP<sup>+</sup> cells present in the ischemic kidneys were smaller and primarily circulating or briefly crawling within the peritubular capillaries, indicative of impaired cell activation and adhesion (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Video 2</xref>). The effect of entospletinib on neutrophil and monocyte recruitment, quantified by flow cytometry, aligned with the transcriptomic and intravital microscopy findings over 14 days after IRI. IRI induced a significant increase in kidney CD44<sup>+</sup> neutrophils and monocytes at 24 hours as well as CD45<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils and CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes over 14 days, effects that were significantly reversed by entospletinib (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, F&#8211;I</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 15</xref>). Therefore, the transcriptomic, intravital microscopy, and flow cytometry data collectively show that entospletinib inhibits early and late neutrophil/monocyte recruitment to the kidney following IRI.</p><p>The impact of entospletinib on dendritic cell and macrophage populations following IRI and AKI-to-CKD transition was next examined. scRNA-seq analysis demonstrated that for the most part, various dendritic cell populations increased over time after IRI, but entospletinib did not have a major impact on these cells (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 16</xref>). On the other hand, entospletinib significantly altered the renal macrophage landscape. Cells annotated as resident macrophages, expressing genes such as <italic toggle="yes">Cx3cr1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Arhgap22</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Tgfbr1</italic>, were the largest leukocyte population in healthy kidneys (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref>, <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 11</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref> File 3). At 24 hours after IRI, a significant reduction in resident macrophages occurred in parallel with a transient increase in a distinct population annotated as AKI-associated macrophages. Besides the scavenger receptor <italic toggle="yes">Cd36</italic> (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), these AKI macrophages also expressed genes related to positive and negative immune modulation, and apoptotic cell clearance, including <italic toggle="yes">Cxcl16</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Creb5</italic> (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), <italic toggle="yes">Stab1</italic> (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), <italic toggle="yes">Dab2</italic> (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), <italic toggle="yes">Axl</italic> (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), <italic toggle="yes">Lilrb4</italic> (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), and <italic toggle="yes">C1qa</italic> (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 11B</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref> File 3). As AKI progressed to CKD, the resident macrophage population began to recover in vehicle-treated mice, while a population annotated as CKD-associated macrophages expanded and persisted over 14 days (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref>). These nonresolving CKD-associated macrophages highly expressed genes such as <italic toggle="yes">Mrc1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Clec7a</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Nlrp3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Cd83</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Cd86</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Syk</italic> (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6K</xref>, <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 11C</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref> File 3). In contrast, entospletinib blunted the acute reduction in total kidney macrophages at 24 hours and preserved the resident population. At 7 and 14 days following IRI, resident macrophages increased further in entospletinib-treated mice compared with controls, while a notable reduction in the emergence of nonresolving CKD-associated macrophages was observed (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref>). Flow cytometry corroborated the transcriptomic findings. IRI induced the progressive expansion of F4/80<sup>hi</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages over 14 days of AKI-to-CKD transition, an effect that was attenuated by entospletinib (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, L and M</xref>).

Although some of the macrophage-expressed transcripts trended toward the renal cortex or medulla, clear regional changes in gene expression were not observed. Cross-validation against the scRNA-seq dataset confirmed the enrichment of these inflammatory and repair genes in macrophages (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 11</xref>, C and D).

Flow cytometry was consistent with the proinflammatory macrophage mRNA signatures, demonstrating an increase in large macrophages expressing cell surface markers such as F4/80, CD86, MHCII, and CD11b over 14 days after IRI, changes that were attenuated by entospletinib (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7, L&#8211;O</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 20</xref>). Together, these data suggest that entospletinib significantly influences macrophage inflammatory and repair phenotypes induced by IRI and during the AKI-to-CKD transition.</p><p>SYK is activated downstream of DAMP-sensing C-type lectin receptors such as CLEC4E (Mincle, <italic toggle="yes">Clec4e</italic>) and CLEC7A (Dectin-1, <italic toggle="yes">Clec7a</italic>) that have been implicated in kidney disease (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).

Since neutrophil populations persisted over 14 days (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), <italic toggle="yes">Clec4e</italic> signaling could therefore contribute to nonresolving inflammation observed in the AKI-to-CKD transition.

These computational analyses were confirmed at the protein level using immunofluorescence microscopy that showed F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages adjacent to galectin 9&#8211;expressing tubules, as well as vimentin- and collagen 1/3&#8211;expressing tubular and interstitial cells at 14 days following IRI (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9, G&#8211;I</xref>). Importantly, many interstitial CD206<sup>+</sup> macrophages, including those adjacent to injured tubules, expressed phosphorylated SYK (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9J</xref>), reinforcing the premise that DAMPs released from injured cells in the renal microenvironment promote SYK and macrophage activation. In contrast, the relationship between macrophages, injured tubules, and fibrosis was greatly reduced or largely absent in the kidneys of mice treated with entospletinib. Entospletinib reduced the expression of <italic toggle="yes">Mrc1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Clec7a</italic> receptors, and associated FcR&#947; genes as well as the downstream signaling molecules, including <italic toggle="yes">Grb2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Cdc42</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Nfkb1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Nfkb2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Syk</italic> itself (likely due to a reduction in inflammatory signaling) throughout the AKI-to-CKD transition (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 19</xref>).

Importantly, this study elucidates entospletinib&#8217;s mechanism of action in kidney injury and identifies it as a potential therapeutic agent to resolve renal inflammation and enhance repair for human AKI.</p><p>Immediately after AKI, immune cells are recruited to the kidney, guided by proinflammatory factors expressed from injured tubular cells and resident immune cells. Nonresolving inflammation is a key characteristic in the progression to CKD that contributes to the failure of kidney repair resulting in tubular atrophy and renal fibrosis. Our data suggest that SYK plays a major role propagating inflammation in the kidney downstream of CD206 and CLEC7A and are consistent with the previously reported role for the related C-type lectin receptor CLEC4E in AKI (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Maladaptive tubules during AKI-to-CKD transition are characterized by the high expression of <italic toggle="yes">Vcam1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Havcr1</italic>, and other proinflammatory genes combined with low <italic toggle="yes">Lrp2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Egf</italic> expression (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).

The significant correlation between CD206- and CLEC7A-expressing macrophages with injured tubules as well as &#945;SMA<sup>+</sup> cells (that also produce ECM proteins and potential DAMPs) sheds additional light on how nonresolving renal inflammation is activated during kidney injury and the potential contribution of SYK in this immune mechanism. The attenuation of proinflammatory gene expression by entospletinib was associated with a reduction in the number of nonresolving CKD macrophages and a parallel reduction in &#945;SMA<sup>+</sup> cells, ECM, and growth factor gene expression. Our data therefore suggest that pharmacologic SYK inhibition with entospletinib appears to break the cycle of inflammation, injury, and fibrosis following IRI in the kidney.</p><p>SYK inhibition also enhanced repair pathways in the kidney. First, entospletinib blunted the maladaptive phenotype of injured tubules, decreasing <italic toggle="yes">Vcam1</italic> as well as the expression of numerous proinflammatory and profibrotic genes. Since tubular cells were found to express lower levels of <italic toggle="yes">Syk</italic>, the effect of entospletinib on this cellular compartment may have been indirect and related to the reduction in neutrophils and proinflammatory macrophages that expressed genes such as <italic toggle="yes">Il1b</italic>. A direct effect of entospletinib on tubules, however, cannot be ruled out. Second, entospletinib preserved resident macrophage and Treg populations that are needed for renal repair and maintained the expression of prorepair genes such as <italic toggle="yes">Egf</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Vegfa</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Ghr</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Thus, rather than directly activating repair pathways, entospletinib likely tipped the balance between inflammation/injury and repair, creating a more favorable environment for kidney recovery.</p><p>An effective therapeutic strategy for AKI and CKD should target inflammation and injury pathways as well as promote or activate renal repair. This study is one of the few to report a pharmacological agent that mechanistically targets nonresolving inflammation while enhancing repair pathways in the kidney. Entospletinib, a selective and potent second-generation SYK inhibitor, has completed several clinical trials for patients with hematological malignancies (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Entospletinib has a favorable short-term toxicity profile, and the human equivalent dose estimated from this study would be considerably lower than what is currently being used for lymphoma and leukemia (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Furthermore, given the plasma drug concentrations achieved in this study that approach the EC<sub>50</sub>, entospletinib would be expected to have minimal off-target effects (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), although they cannot be completely excluded. Thus, a short course of entospletinib in patients at risk for AKI may be a feasible therapeutic approach that could be tested in a clinical trial.</p><p>Altogether, these results highlight the role of the immune system in the AKI-to-CKD transition and position SYK as a key modulator of nonresolving inflammation. SYK inhibition with entospletinib represents a potential therapeutic agent to improve outcomes for human AKI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sex as a biological variable.</title><p>Both male and female animals were used equally for general experiments.

Slides were prepared by baking in a drying oven for 3 hours at 60&#176;C and then processed following the Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler slide preparation (MAN-10150) and NGS readout (MAN-10153) manual. Briefly, slides were deparaffinized with xylene and then rehydrated through a graded ethanol series. Targets were exposed by incubating with 1&#215; Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 9 followed by 1 &#956;g/mL proteinase K digestion. Next, Mouse Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA) Probes (NanoString Technologies) were hybridized to the tissues at 37&#176;C for 16 to 24 hours. Excess and off-target probes are removed by 2&#215; SSC/50% formamide. After washing, the slides were blocked in Buffer W and stained with morphological markers for 1 hour at room temperature. The fluorescently conjugated morphology markers used are as follows: SYTO 13 nuclei acid stain at 1:50 dilution (GMX-MORPH-NUC-12, NanoString), PanCK-AF532 at 1:50 dilution (AE-1/AE-3, NBP2-33200AF532, Novus), IBA1-AF594 at 1:100 dilution (E4O4W,48934, Cell Signaling Technology), and CD10-AF647 at 1:50 dilution (EPR22867-118, ab261729, Abcam). Excess markers were removed with 2 washes in 2&#215; SSC. Stained slides were loaded onto a GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiler and scanned. During the study, at least 1 ROI in the medulla and 2 ROIs in the cortex were selected using morphological markers as guides and glomeruli avoided. For further analysis, 2 segmented AOIs were chosen: macrophages were identified as IBA1<sup>+</sup> cells, and tubular cells were identified as either CD10<sup>+</sup>pan-CK<sup>+</sup> double-positive cells or only Pan-CK<sup>+</sup> cells. RNA-ID and UMI-containing oligonucleotide tags were UV-cleaved from the WTA probes within the chosen ROIs collected in a 96-well collection plate. For library preparation, Illumina i5 and i7 dual-indexing primers were added to the oligonucleotide tags during PCR to uniquely index each AOI. AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) were used for PCR purification. Library concentration was measured using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and quality was assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).
