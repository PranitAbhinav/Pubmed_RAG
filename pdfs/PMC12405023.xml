Efforts in discovering inhibitors against these transporters often result in amino acid-based inhibitors that lack selectivity and are likely to compete with amino acid substrates to bind their targets.

The best inhibitors inhibited SNAT2 with IC<sub>50</sub>s in the range of 0.64&#8211;1.08&#160;mM. Many of the fragment compounds showed an apparent hyperpolarization in the FMP assay, making it difficult to determine their ability to be translocated by SNAT2. An allosteric mechanism of inhibition was implied for the thiazole and oxazole scaffolds, as these resulted in inhibition patterns that resembled non- or un-competitive inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">In conclusion, we discovered multiple novel non-amino acid compounds that inhibited SNAT2 and can serve as starting points for the further development of SNAT2 inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11095-025-03902-7.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Amino acid transporter</kwd><kwd>FMP assay</kwd><kwd>Fragment-based screening</kwd><kwd>Inhibitor</kwd><kwd>SNAT2</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011958</institution-id><institution>Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10.46540/2035-00046B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>Carsten Uhd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002808</institution-id><institution>Carlsbergfondet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CF20-0270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>Carsten Uhd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Nordforsk program Nordic University Hub</institution></funding-source><award-id>Project #85352</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of Southern Denmark</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by University of Southern Denmark</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Amino acids are important in regulating cell growth and metabolism and act as neurotransmitters or sources of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (CNS). Amino acid transporters (AATs) have recently gained interest as pharmacological targets primarily for their role in cancer in addition to their more established role as drug targets in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In cancer, it is primarily the supply of glutamine, which fuels the glutaminolysis pathway, that has been targeted by AAT inhibitors along with the amino acid-induced activation of the cell growth regulator mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. An example of the therapeutic use of targeting AATs is exemplified by JPH203 (nanvuranlat), an inhibitor of the large amino acid transporter LAT1 (SLC7A5), which is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of biliary tract cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, AAT inhibitors are, in most cases, based on an amino acid scaffold, which comes with a number of challenges. Firstly, the similar amino acid core has often proven to give selectivity issues, given that there are more than 60 different AATs to accommodate 20 proteinogenic amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, amino acid-based inhibitors are expected to bind to the substrate binding site of the AATs and thus compete with the natural substrates for binding. Therefore, it might be more beneficial to target allosteric sites of AATs. For instance, it has been shown that AATs of the SLC1 subfamily have a conserved allosteric site that has been successfully targeted by inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">An AAT, which is underexplored in terms of inhibitor identification, is the sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter SNAT2 (SLC38A2). This ubiquitously expressed AAT is characterized by a substrate preference for small- to medium-sized neutral amino acids like alanine and glutamine and is highly upregulated by amino acid starvation and hyperosmotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. SNAT2 has been implicated in cancers, such as gastric and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and might also play a role in the glutamate-glutamine cycle in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. SNAT2 inhibition has, at this point, primarily been based on amino acid analogs with IC<sub>50</sub>s in the range of 0.2&#8211;2&#160;mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but a single non-amino acid inhibitor named MMTC has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, MMTC was not able to show SNAT2 inhibition in a different study using a different cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The 3D-structure of SNAT2 has yet to be solved, therefore making <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> drug discovery campaigns challenging. This leaves <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> screening approaches as the remaining viable option to discover novel inhibitor scaffolds, but they can be quite costly and time-consuming. Alternatively, fragment-based screening offers a more efficient way to screen for new scaffolds, using small compounds that are often more soluble, where the hits often have moderate affinities, in the millimolar range, that can serve as a molecular starting point for finding new inhibitors. Since chemical space is sampled more efficiently with the low molecular weight fragment compounds compared to high-throughput approaches, a much smaller library is needed, making the screening process less demanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. While these fragment-based methods are relatively new within the field of transporters, they have been used effectively to find inhibitors of SLC25A20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], as well as more soluble inhibitors of the ABC transporter BCRP (ABCG2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Here, we have aimed to uncover non-amino acid inhibitors of SNAT2 by broadly and efficiently searching for novel scaffolds that can serve as starting points for the development of inhibitors. To do so, we screened a diverse library of fragment-sized compounds for their inhibition of SNAT2. Based on the initial screen, we then explored the structure&#8211;activity relationship of the hit structures and determined their inhibitory potency. Furthermore, we used the FLIPR membrane potential (FMP) assay to investigate if these novel ligands were translocated by SNAT2 to establish if they were substrates or inhibitors. Following this, we investigated their mechanism of inhibition. Our results present a novel class of non-amino acid SNAT2 inhibitors that do not compete with substrate binding and, thus, seemingly work through an allosteric mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par8">[2-<sup>3</sup>H]-Glycine (45.2&#160;Ci &#8901; mmol<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), L-[3,4,5-<sup>3</sup>H(N)]-leucine (72.6&#160;Ci &#8901; mmol<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), Ultima GoldTM scintillation fluid, and scintillation vials (6&#160;mL, Pony VialTM) were from Perkin Elmer/Revvity (Waltham, MA, USA).

Focusing on the SAR of the 1,3-benzothiazole-2-amine scaffold, it is seen that the non-substituted scaffold cannot inhibit SNAT2 at 1&#160;mM when comparing <bold>3</bold> to <bold>7</bold>. The same appears to be true for the 1,3-benzoxazole-2-amine scaffold, comparing <bold>5</bold> to <bold>24</bold>. Looking at the positioning of the chloro substituent in the benzothiazole scaffold, it is seen that only positions 6 and 7 (corresponding to compounds <bold>3</bold> and <bold>8,</bold> respectively) show inhibition, while 5-chloro-1,3-benzothiazol-2-amine (<bold>9</bold>) and 4-chloro-1,3-benzothiazol-2-amine (<bold>10</bold>) show no inhibition. Interestingly, the benzoxazole scaffold appears to be different, given that <bold>5</bold> shows inhibition, despite the chloro group being in the 5-position. As for which substituents that led to inhibition of SNAT2, hydrophobic groups like halogens (<bold>3</bold>, <bold>5</bold>, <bold>11</bold>), methyl (<bold>12</bold>), and ethyl (<bold>14</bold>) groups appear favorable, while hydrophilic groups like hydroxyl (<bold>17</bold>), amino (<bold>20</bold>), carboxyl (<bold>21</bold>), and nitro (<bold>25</bold>) groups appear unfavorable.

The trifluoromethoxy group seen in <bold>18</bold>, also known as the drug compound riluzole used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], initially appeared to be favorable for SNAT2 inhibition, but this compound also showed a similar decrease in cellular ATP levels as seen in the CellTiter-Glo assay, linking the observed inhibition to a possible cytotoxic effect. Other notable takeaways are that the ring closure of <bold>1</bold> seen in <bold>23</bold> appears to have a negative impact on its inhibitory activity and that the naphthalene amidine (<bold>2</bold>) is favorable to that of the phenyl amidine (<bold>28</bold>).

Because of solubility limitations, it was difficult to attain high enough concentrations to profile the bottom of the IC<sub>50</sub>-curve, which is why the bottom was constrained to the value achieved by the positive control (20&#160;mM L-Gln). For <bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold>, and <bold>5,</bold> the IC<sub>50</sub> curves were comparable with IC<sub>50</sub>s in the range of 0.69&#8211;1.08&#160;mM. <bold>14</bold> appeared to be the most potent inhibitor based on its IC<sub>50</sub> value but also showed a noticeably steeper decrease in <sup>3</sup>H-Gly uptake with increased concentrations.

Interestingly, all of the compounds (except <bold>5</bold>) tested for their concentration dependence showed a marked decrease in the CellTiter-Glo signal at their highest tested concentration (Supplementary Information, Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3A</xref>). However, when the cells were allowed to recover in cell culture media for 30&#160;min after exposure to the compounds, their ATP levels seemed to restore and were comparable with the control, except for 2&#160;mM <bold>18</bold> (Supplementary Information, Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3B</xref>). Furthermore, when tested in the XTT viability assay, only 2&#160;mM <bold>18</bold> seemed to drastically impact the cell viability, while a slight effect was seen for 2&#160;mM <bold>14</bold> (Supplementary Information, Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Thus, it appears that the effect seen in the CellTiter-Glo assay for the majority of these compounds is more of a transient decrease in the ATP levels. Looking at the compound's effect at 1&#160;mM on <sup>3</sup>H-Leu uptake, which we have used to study LAT1 activity in PC-3 cells, none of the compounds appeared to signifcantly inhbit the uptake (Supplementary Information, Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Thus, the observed inhibition appears to be selective to SNAT2 compared to LAT1. If a cytotoxic effect was the reason for the observed inhibition of <sup>3</sup>H-Gly uptake, then the same would be expected in the <sup>3</sup>H-Leu uptake. Especially since the isoosmotically treated PC-3 cells used for the <sup>3</sup>H-Leu uptake assay appear to be more susceptible to a reduction in the CellTiter-Glo signal compared to the hyperosmotically treated PC-3 cells used for the <sup>3</sup>H-Gly uptake assay (Supplementary Information,&#160;Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>).

Furthermore, both riluzole and zoxazolamine (<bold>5</bold>) have been shown to activate the SK2 potassium channel, which would increase the potassium conductance and hyperpolarize the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These interactions with ion channels can perhaps also explain the observed fall in ATP levels, given that the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase might consume an increased amount of ATP to restore the ion gradients. On the other hand, the FMP trace for 1&#160;mM <bold>2</bold>, which does not equally resemble riluzole structurally, closely follows the background control trace and, therefore, does not appear to affect the membrane polarization of the cells.<fig id="Fig5" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;5</label><caption><p>Time-response curve showing the change in fluorescence from the baseline (&#916;F) in the FLIPR membrane potential (FMP) assay in hyperosmotically treated PC-3 cells (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;3, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;7&#8211;9).

This was done for two reasons. One was to see if the observed decrease in the FMP signal by the fragment compounds could be reversed by the addition of Gly. The second was to see if the Gly-induced FMP signal could be inhibited by the fragment compounds, as seen in the uptake studies. Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows the AUCs of the FMP curves of both SNAT2 uptake inhibiting (<bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, <bold>5</bold>, and <bold>14</bold>) and non-inhibiting (<bold>4</bold> and <bold>7</bold>) fragment compounds in the absence or presence of Gly. The apparent hyperpolarization seen by <bold>1</bold> appears to be moderately reversed by the addition of high concentrations of Gly. The same seems true for 0.33&#160;mM <bold>5</bold>, but not in the case of 1&#160;mM <bold>5</bold>. 1&#160;mM <bold>7</bold> also appears to cause a hyperpolarization that is only slightly reversed by the addition of 10&#160;mM Gly. However, <bold>7</bold> does not inhibit SNAT2 in uptake studies, indicating that <sup>3</sup>H-Gly uptake inhibition is not linked to the hyperpolarizing effect. In fact, it has been shown that SNAT2 produces larger currents (indicating a higher transport rate) at lower membrane potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], again suggesting that a hyperpolarization would not be the cause of observed inhibition. <bold>2</bold> and <bold>4</bold> both seem to have no impact on membrane polarization on their own, but while <bold>2</bold> both inhibits <sup>3</sup>H-Gly uptake and the FMP signal caused by Gly, <bold>4</bold> inhibits neither. <bold>14</bold> decreases the FMP signal, which is not reversed by the addition of 10&#160;mM Gly. Because of the apparent hyperpolarization caused by <bold>1</bold>, <bold>3</bold>, <bold>5</bold>, and <bold>14</bold>, which is likely caused by interactions with targets other than SNAT2, we cannot resolve if they are translocated by SNAT2 or not. However, as <bold>2</bold> did not affect the membrane potential and showed inhibition in both the uptake and FMP assays, it appears to be a non-translocated inhibitor of SNAT2.<fig id="Fig6" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;6</label><caption><p>Area under the curve (AUC) of FMP curves of fragment compounds in hyperosmotically treated PC-3 cells in the absence or presence of 1&#160;mM or 10&#160;mM Gly (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;3&#8211;5, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;7&#8211;15).

On the other hand, <bold>5</bold> appears to show better inhibition of <sup>3</sup>H-Gly uptake when the substrate concentration is increased, which is indicative of un-competitive inhibition. To confirm that these observations fit the different inhibition types, O-benzyl-L-serine was also studied, which was previously shown to be a substrate of SNAT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and thus should inhibit the uptake competitively. Here, the increase in substrate concentration decreased the observed inhibition by O-benzyl-L-serine as expected of a competitive inhibitor (Supplementary Information, Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). Interestingly, <bold>2</bold> appeared to follow the same pattern, indicating that it also competed with the substrate to bind SNAT2 (Supplementary Information, Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>).<fig id="Fig7" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;7</label><caption><p>Normalized <sup>3</sup>H-Gly uptake in hyperosmotically treated PC-3 cells in the presence of <bold>1</bold> or <bold>5</bold> at increasing concentration of cold Gly (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;3, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6).

Both have an affinity for 2-(methylamino)isobutyrate (MeAIB) and similar substrate profiles, but the orphan system has better affinities for its substrates compared to that of SNAT1 and SNAT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, this high-affinity system is also inhibited by riluzole and related structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In fact, there is some overlap in the structure&#8211;activity relationship seen here for SNAT2 and what has been described for the high-affinity SNAT-like system. For instance, in both cases, the non-substituted 1,3-benzothiazole-2-amine scaffold shows limited inhibition, substitution at the 6-position appears to be favored, and amine or carboxyl groups at the 6-position show weak inhibition, while a chloro group (as seen in <bold>3</bold>) shows great inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although these riluzole-related compounds show better inhibitory potencies for the high-affinity system (&gt;&#8201;100-fold difference), it is quite noteworthy that this inhibitor scaffold has been discovered for two similar transport systems through completely different and independent methods. It could suggest that the high-affinity system is an orphan SLC38/SNAT member and that a somewhat conserved allosteric site exists where these inhibitors might bind. While Kyllo et al. proposes that inhibitors enact their inhibition through an indirect mechanism involving a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent cycling of an intracellular store of transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], we suggest that the inhibitors bind allosterically to the transporter given the short time 5-min exposure and because the inhibition has been observed in different cell lines (neurons versus prostate cancer cells). In any case, these 1,3-benzothiazole-2-amines and 1,3-benzoxazole-2-amines appear to be a novel class of inhibitors that can alter the activity of SNAT-like transporters. Still, these compounds are of low potency when it comes to SNAT2 inhibition, but present a great opportunity, as these scaffolds, when further optimized by medicinal chemistry approaches, can become valuable chemical tools to study SNAT2 and related transporters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par30">By screening a fragment-based library, we discovered a novel set of non-amino acid inhibitors of SNAT2, primarily based on 1,3-benzothiazole-2-amines and 1,3-benzoxazole-2-amine scaffolds.
