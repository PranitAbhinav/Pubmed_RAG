In 1911, they were successfully crystallized and designated as'crystallised dextrin &#945;'and'crystallised dextrin &#946;.'Subsequently, various novel synthesis techniques and methodologies were devised to fulfill the laboratory-scale demand for producing cyclodextrins. Since then, CDs have garnered significant attention from scholars, leading to a surge in scientific publications and patent applications, showcasing their diverse applications as specialty chemicals and indispensable components in chromatographic methods, stabilizers, catalysts, etc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The principal attribute of CDs hinges on their capacity to'encapsulate'molecules at the molecular level. Over the past few decades, there has been an ever-expanding number of applications of CDs in numerous domains, including the food science [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], chemical compound separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], pollutant removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and drug formulation. Solubility and permeability enhancement are critical and widely popular topics in pharmaceutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Cyclodextrins are well-known for their ability to enhance both properties, making them valuable excipients in drug formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Haloperidol (HAL) is an antipsychotic compound with a primary application in the management of conditions such as schizophrenia, delusions, and hallucinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], HAL is a weakly-basic BCS Class II substance with p<italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sub>a</sub> 8.65 (Drug Bank) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], a low aqueous solubility of less than 0.1&#160;mg/mL and oral bioavailability <italic toggle="yes">ca</italic>. 60&#8211;65% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. HAL is commonly used as a model drug due to its poor aqueous solubility.</p><p id="Par7">In the pursuit of enhancing the solubility and bioavailability of haloperidol, commonly available cyclodextrins (CDs), including &#945;-, &#946;-, and &#947;-CD, have been used as host molecules. Cyclodextrin inclusion complexation relies on the establishment of host&#8211;guest inclusion complexes through weak intermolecular interactions, a technique widely employed to address the solubility challenges associated with poorly water-soluble drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite the wide use of &#945;- and &#946;-CD, along with their derivatives, for solubility enhancement, it is important to note that &#945;- and &#946;-CD themselves possess relatively low aqueous solubilities of 15&#160;mg/mL and 18&#160;mg/mL, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As such, in this study, hydroxypropyl &#946;-CD (HP-&#946;-CD) and methyl &#946;-CD (Me-&#946;-CD) were selected as agents to significantly enhance the solubility of HAL in ultrapure water due to their higher aqueous solubilities of 65&#160;mg/mL and 60&#160;mg/mL, respectively.</p><p id="Par8">The association of haloperidol with cyclodextrins has been investigated in several previous studies. Pisaniello <italic toggle="yes">et al&#160;</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] examined the complexation of haloperidol with &#945;- and &#947;-cyclodextrins using <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy by monitoring chemical shift changes in the fluorine nucleus of the drug. They estimated the stability constants and concluded that the values are relatively low, suggesting that these cyclodextrins may not be effective carriers for haloperidol in clinical drug delivery applications. Loukas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] employed <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy to study the interaction between haloperidol and hydroxypropyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin, confirming the formation of 1:1 inclusion complex. In a different study, Loukas <italic toggle="yes">et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] investigated the complexation of haloperidol with both methyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin. They observed a 20-fold and 12-fold increase in drug solubility with a 10-fold excess of methyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin, respectively, and confirmed a 1:1 stoichiometry for both inclusion complexes. More recently, Omari <italic toggle="yes">et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] investigated the complexation of haloperidol with &#946;-cyclodextrin using a comprehensive set of techniques, including phase solubility analysis, 1H NMR spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy and molecular mechanical modeling. They concluded that both protonated and neutral haloperidol form soluble 1:1 and 1:2 (haloperidol: &#946;-cyclodextrin) inclusion complexes, although ionization of the drug significantly reduces its tendency to form such complexes.</p><p id="Par9">Haloperidol exerts a characteristic effect in rodents, inducing a state of catalepsy&#8212;a transient condition marked by immobility, diminished responsiveness to external stimuli, and the maintenance of abnormal postures for prolonged periods. This response is widely employed as a behavioral model to investigate haloperidol&#8217;s impact on dopaminergic pathways and to assess its extrapyramidal side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have examined the effect of haloperidol on lower animals such as planaria. These invertebrate flatworms possess a relatively simple yet functionally relevant nervous system, including dopaminergic signaling pathways, making them promising candidates for neuropharmacological investigations. Employing live invertebrates such as planaria to study the pharmacological effects of haloperidol and its formulations offers a valuable opportunity to reduce dependence on mammalian models. This strategy aligns with the 3Rs principles&#8212;Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement&#8212;by facilitating more ethical and sustainable approaches to early-stage drug testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">In the present study, the effects of various cyclodextrins (&#945;-, &#946;-, &#947;-, hydroxypropyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin, and methyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin) on the aqueous solubility of haloperidol were evaluated. The interactions between haloperidol and cyclodextrins in solution were comprehensively investigated using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the stoichiometry of the resulting inclusion complexes was determined spectrophotometrically via Job's plot analysis.

The UV calibration curve, displayed in Supplementary Information Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, meets the necessary requirements for accurate determination. As the inclusion complex itself is more soluble than HAL, the overall result is an increase in HAL solubility. Phase solubility studies were carried out in aqueous systems. The effect of CD concentration on the aqueous solubility of haloperidol was studied at room temperature and the results are shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;1</label><caption><p>The effect of the concentration of various CDs on the aqueous solubility of HAL at room temperature.</p></caption><graphic id="MO1" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="11095_2025_3909_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par24">Firstly, the intrinsic solubility of HAL in ultrapure water is 5.1&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.2&#160;&#956;g/mL, which is larger than 2.5&#160;&#956;g/mL reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, the plot shows that HP-&#946;-CD, Me-&#946;-CD and &#945;-CD improve the intrinsic solubility of HAL in ultrapure water whereas &#947;-CD does not enhance it. The relationship between HAL solubility and &#946;-CD is more complex: solubility initially increases with rising &#946;-CD concentration, reaching a maximum at 8&#160;mg/mL, after which further increases in &#946;-CD concentration lead to a decrease in HAL solubility. Due to their greater solubility in water (approximately 65&#160;mg/mL and 60&#160;mg/mL, respectively), HP-&#946;-CD and Me-&#946;-CD that included HAL were able to achieve the highest solubilities of 77&#8201;&#177;&#8201;5&#160;&#956;g/mL and 97&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2&#160;&#956;g/mL, respectively. It appears that the solubilizing effect of Me-&#946;-CD is significantly (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05) greater than that of HP-&#946;-CD at the concentration of 50&#160;mg/mL. This could be attributed to the higher aqueous solubility of the methylated derivative and or a slightly better complexing ability of the derivative. Compared with the solubilizing power of HP-&#946;-CD and Me-&#946;-CD, when the concentration of &#945;-CD was 14&#160;mg/mL, the solubility of HAL increased to 23.0&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6.0&#160;&#956;g/mL, approximately 5 times greater than the intrinsic one (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). &#947;-CD failed to increase the solubility of HAL. HP-&#946;-CD and Me-&#946;-CD are capable of loading significantly more HAL, as confirmed by the statistically significant differences in solubility. It has been reported in literature that the solubility of haloperidol can be improved to 8&#160;&#956;g/mL at a &#946;-CD concentration of 6&#160;mg/mL, an outcome that is in line with our results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

In addition, in the presence of &#947;-CD the solubility of HAL was even lower (3.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.5&#160;&#956;g/mL) when the concentration of &#947;-CD was 4&#160;mg/mL.</p><p id="Par25">The stability constant (<italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sub>st</sub>) is commonly used in the literature to describe the binding strength and equilibrium between the components of the inclusion complex formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

Furthermore, there was also a significant difference even at 10&#160;mg/mL of Me-&#946;-CD or HP-&#946;-CD, which indicated that Me-&#946;-CD and HP-&#946;-CD improve solubility of haloperidol. In addition, the solubilizing capabilities of Me-&#946;-CD and HP-&#946;-CD were also compared, which demonstrated that the enhancement of solubility in the presence of Me-&#946;-CD was significantly better compared to HP-&#946;-CD (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001). This means that Me-&#946;-CD has the best solubilizing capability to haloperidol among these four CDs.

The sharp HAL endotherm is absent in both inclusion complexes, indicating that the inclusion complexes prepared by means of freeze-drying process are amorphous.
</p><p id="Par34">Next, physical mixtures of HAL and CDs were prepared by three different methods: whirl mixing, grinding and ball milling. These methods were used to ensure that the ingredients were evenly mixed, without applying conditions specifically intended to promote inclusion complex formation. Whirl mixing involves gentle agitation to blend the two materials together without applying significant mechanical force. Grinding in a mortar and pestle is a mechanical process that applies moderate pressure and shear to reduce particle size and mix components. Ball milling subjects the powders to higher-energy collisions between stainless steel balls contained in an oscillating chamber, leading to finer particle sizes and more intimate mixing. These methods vary in their intensity and level of energy input (ball milling&#8201;&gt;&#8201;grinding&#8201;&gt;&#8201;whirl mixing), which can influence the homogeneity of the mixture and the likelihood of interaction between components. As can be seen from Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, three kinds of physical mixtures show a small peak at 150 &#8451; corresponding to the melting point of HAL. Compared with inclusion complexes, all of the physical mixtures have this characteristic melting peak of HAL and the disappearance of the drug melting peak in inclusion complexes suggests that it is incorporated in the cavities of CD in a fully amorphous form. All the melting peaks in different kinds of physical mixture were integrated by software and degree of crystallinity was calculated using the equation below:</p><p id="Par35"><inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="d33e632">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In each experiment, a single planarian is placed in a Petri dish filled with the solution of interest, which is then positioned on graph paper. The movement of the planarian is recorded on video, and the crossings of the graph paper grid are subsequently analyzed and presented graphically as cumulative line crossings over time. Then, the slope of each line was determined through linear regression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These slopes were then utilized to construct a bar chart displaying the cumulative slopes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). By comparing the slopes, one can discern changes in mobility of planaria; an upward slope indicates better mobility with a greater speed. Pure HAL in solutions inhibited the mobility of planaria, and as the concentration of HAL increases, there is a progressively greater reduction in the mobility slopes, which suggests a dose-dependent relationship. This result is consistent with the pharmacological effects of haloperidol on higher animals, such as mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For example, in rats, the administration of haloperidol induces catalepsy, characterized by temporary immobilization and restricted mobility. Similarly, haloperidol significantly limits the mobility of planaria flatworms in solution. This observation suggests that planaria may possibly serve as a lower animal model to substitute mammals in experiments on catalepsy.
</p><p id="Par42">Pure solutions of &#945;-CD, HP-&#946;-CD and ME-&#946;-CD mildly restrained planarian mobility, resulting in reduction of the slope value from 8.20&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.22 recorded in pure APW to 6.40&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.73, 5.50&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.06 and 4.80&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.39, respectively. This reduction in planaria mobility was statistically significant (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). However, there was no significant difference among the slopes recorded in the presence of HP-&#946;-CD and Me-&#946;-CD compared to APW (p&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.05). Cyclodextrins are known in the literature to enhance drug permeability through the biological membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, in the planaria experiments, an unexpected trend emerged. Notably, pure HAL exhibited stronger mobility inhibition on planaria compared to HAL in CD inclusion complexes. This observation suggests that HAL in inclusion complexes faces greater difficulty in traversing the planarian epithelia, likely due to the strong complexation between HAL and CDs, which hinders drug release from the cavity. This finding is consistent with the <italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sub>st</sub> values obtained for the inclusion complexes of haloperidol and cyclodextrins, which confirm strong binding between the drug and the cyclodextrin, further supporting the observed effect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par43">From the findings of the experiments outlined above, it is apparent that HP-&#946;-CD, ME-&#946;-CD, and &#945;-CD offer substantial improvements in the solubility of unprotonated HAL within aqueous solutions. &#946;-CD provided very modest improvements in the solubility of HAL, with a slight increase observed as the &#946;-CD concentration rose to 8&#160;mg/mL; in contrast, &#947;-CD did not produce any noticeable enhancements in the drug solubility. Notably, HP-&#946;-CD and ME-&#946;-CD emerged as the top performers, yielding nearly a 20-fold enhancement in HAL solubility. This underscores the potential of modified &#946;-CD as a carrier for HAL, promising significant advancements in addressing its solubility challenges.</p><p id="Par44">Moreover, the interaction between CD and HAL has been elucidated through various analytical techniques such as NMR, DSC, and Job&#8217;s plots, indicating a 1:1 stoichiometry. According to data from DSC and PXRD studies, haloperidol is presented in freeze-dried formulations of inclusion complexes in an amorphous state.</p><p id="Par45">HAL in aqueous solutions exerts a strong effect on the mobility of planaria, resembling the catalepsy observed in mammalian models. This finding demonstrates the potential of planaria to replace mammals such as mice and rats in experimentation with haloperidol, its derivatives, analogues and their formulations. Using planaria in this context has important implications for 3Rs research, promoting the replacement of higher animals in experimentation and enhancing ethical standards in scientific research.</p><p id="Par46">Despite HAL's ability to enter the CD cavity, as demonstrated by physicochemical analyses, the planaria study revealed that these CDs were unable to facilitate HAL's passage through the planarian membrane. This is likely attributed to the strong binding inside CDs cavity between the CDs and HAL, which has an inhibition of releasing HAL across the planaria&#8217;s membranes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="11095_2025_3909_MOESM1_ESM.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 28 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Chemical Analysis Facility (University of Reading) for access to <sup>1</sup>H NMR, DSC and PXRD.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>The manuscript was written through contributions of all authors.
