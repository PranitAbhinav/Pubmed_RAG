Klotho is a multifunctional protein crucial in ageing, metabolism, and ion homeostasis. It has been confirmed that Klotho serves as a critical protective factor across multiple biological systems, with its roles in neuroprotection, cardiovascular health, and renal function being particularly noteworthy. This study aimed to investigate the protective role of Klotho protein against oxidative and nitrosative stress in heart IRI through regulation of the NOS/MMP pathway. The study utilised in vitro human cardiomyocyte culture and ex vivo isolated rat hearts subjected to IRI. Recombinant Klotho protein was administered to evaluate its effects on heart mechanical function, gene and protein expression of NOS isoforms, oxidative and nitrosative stress markers, MMP activity, and lipid metabolism. Administration of Klotho significantly improved heart mechanical and contractile function following ischemia/reperfusion. Klotho normalised the expression and synthesis of endothelial NOS and inducible NOS, resulting in reduced production of reactive nitrogen species and attenuated nitrosative stress. It also limited oxidative damage, reflected by decreased protein oxidation, and restored fatty acid metabolism. Additionally, Klotho regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 synthesis and activity, thereby protecting heart contractile proteins from degradation. The Klotho protein exhibits significant cardioprotection in IRI by mitigating oxidative and nitrosative stress through the modulation of the NOS/MMP signalling pathway. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of Klotho in managing ischemic heart conditions and myocardial injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Heart failure</kwd><kwd>Myocardial infarction</kwd><kwd>Molecular medicine</kwd><kwd>Experimental models of disease</kwd><kwd>Diagnostic markers</kwd><kwd>Mechanisms of disease</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Science Centre Poland</institution></funding-source><award-id>2019/33/N/NZ3/01649</award-id><award-id>2019/33/N/NZ3/01649</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Olejnik</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Bil-Lula</surname><given-names>Iwona</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Heart ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) results from the temporary blockage of arterial flow, followed by restored circulation. While ischemia alone causes cellular dysfunction and damage, reperfusion exacerbates the injury by triggering inflammatory and oxidative processes, affecting not only the heart but also remote organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">The excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), followed by oxidative/nitrosative stress, is one of the main contributors to IRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Moreover, an altered expression of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) and overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) are observed. While NO functions as a vasodilator in the endothelium and as a radical scavenger, during oxidative stress it reacts with superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8226;&#8722;</sup>) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>&#8722;</sup>), a powerful oxidant and nitrating agent that can inflict damage on the myocardium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

Activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by ROS/RNS during oxidative stress results in the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts, followed by myocardial remodelling and failure.

Its primary functions include the regulation of vitamin D and phosphate metabolism and serving as a vital component in ageing processes and neuroprotection.

The experimental protocol for heart IRI is illustrated in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Isolated hearts from the IRI groups underwent 25&#160;min of aerobic stabilisation, followed by 22&#160;min of global no-flow ischemia (induced by cessation of the buffer flow), and then 30&#160;min of reperfusion (under aerobic conditions) with or without Klotho protein administration. Hearts in the aerobic group were perfused aerobically for 77&#160;min. Recombinant rat &#945;Klotho protein (RPH757Ra01, Cloud-Clone Corp., USA) was diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 ng/mL with the Krebs-Henseleit buffer. To minimise protein degradation, recombinant Klotho was aliquoted upon delivery and stored at &#8722;&#8201;80&#160;&#176;C. A fresh aliquot was thawed and added to the buffer immediately before each experiment. The optimal concentration of Klotho protein was determined experimentally in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, which showed this dose to be the lowest, effective and non-toxic. Higher concentrations of exogenous Klotho protein were associated with deterioration in cardiac function and were therefore excluded from further experiments (data not shown). Klotho was administered with the perfusion buffer during the last 10&#160;min of aerobic stabilisation and the first 10&#160;min of reperfusion (post-global ischemia) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To determine cardiac mechanical function, the recovery of rate pressure product (RPP) was expressed as the product of HR and LVDP and evaluated at 25&#160;min of the experiment (the end of aerobic perfusion) and 77&#160;min (the end of reperfusion). After the experimental protocol, isolated hearts were immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;&#8201;80&#160;&#176;C for further analysis.

Various studies on myocardial injury have shown that IRI is associated with ion accumulation, mitochondrial membrane damage, and endothelial dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying myocardial IRI are not yet fully understood. To achieve optimal cardioprotection, it is necessary to explore additional or synergistic multi-target treatments and identify new potential therapeutic factors. It has been confirmed that Klotho serves as a critical protective factor across multiple biological systems, with its roles in neuroprotection, cardiovascular health, and renal function being particularly noteworthy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Ongoing research continues to explore its therapeutic potential, aiming to leverage Klotho&#8217;s protective mechanisms in treating age-related diseases and improving health outcomes. The present study demonstrated that exogenous Klotho protein contributed to a reduction of oxidative stress and damage in the hearts subjected to IRI. This effect may be associated with the regulation of the NOS/MMP pathway.</p><p id="Par44">In this study, subjecting isolated rat hearts to the IRI procedure led to a decline in hemodynamic parameters. Administration of Klotho protein supported the recovery of heart mechanical and contractile function, expressed by improved RPP, LVDP and HR, indicating a protective effect. Our results correspond to the research of Wang et al. (2022 and 2023), where the treatment with exogenous Klotho protein improved cardiac function in an in vivo mouse model of MI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Klotho gene overexpression also regulated the cardiac function parameters, including HR and LVDP, in rats subjected to experimental MI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Additionally, Klotho supplementation mitigated heart diastolic dysfunction in aged mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and reduced infarct volume in a rat model of myocardial IRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Finally, the high-intensity interval training (HIIT)-induced increase in Klotho plasma and myocardial levels provided cardioprotection and alleviated heart damage following myocardial IRI in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The next stage of this study focused on analysing Klotho expression, where the gene and protein expressions were confirmed in human cardiomyocytes. No significant changes in gene and protein expressions were observed in response to IRI, while incubation of HCM with exogenous Klotho reduced <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> protein synthesis in cells. However, in heart tissue, the analysis revealed upregulated Klotho gene expression after IRI, which was normalised in the IRI&#8201;+&#8201;Klotho group. IRI caused a significant reduction in Klotho protein synthesis in the heart tissue as well. The investigation on Klotho indicates different regulatory mechanisms of Klotho expression in the in vitro and ex vivo models in this study, which requires further research. Importantly, the findings indicate some regulatory mechanisms controlling the Klotho expression differences between cell lines and tissues, suggesting that network changes, in addition to transcriptional levels, should be considered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In this study, a decrease in the level of ADAM17 protein was also observed after Klotho administration. ADAM17 is one of the sheddases responsible for cleaving Klotho from the cell membrane, which results in the release of soluble Klotho into circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The presence of soluble Klotho can influence ADAM17 levels. For instance, higher levels of Klotho may lead to decreased ADAM17 synthesis, thereby reducing further shedding of Klotho itself. The balance between Klotho and ADAM17 is critical for maintaining cardiovascular health. Thus, administration of exogenous Klotho may reduce the levels of ADAM17 through feedback interactions that maintain homeostasis in cardiovascular function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This effect could be observed in this study; however, it should be considered as hypothesis-generated, as no ADAM17 mRNA expression or enzymatic activity was assessed. Our findings on the heart model align with those of Ramez et al. (2020), where heart IRI lowered the myocardial and plasma levels of Klotho in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and of Xu et al. (2021), who showed that experimental MI attenuated Klotho protein expression in rat myocardial tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The level of Klotho protein in the heart was also reduced after myocardial IRI in diabetic rats, and after a high glucose aggravated hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in cultured primary cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Conversely, Klotho deficiency was related to impaired heart function and cardiac hypertrophy in ageing mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, and contributed to heart failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The demonstrated role of Klotho protein in the development of cardiovascular diseases makes it a potential candidate for use as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic agent in the treatment of vascular diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. There is evidence that Klotho protein supplementation protects against the consequences of acute MI, preventing adverse myocardial remodelling and reducing the incidence of heart rhythm disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In one study, through a meta-analysis, it was found that reduced serum Klotho protein levels are an important predictor of increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and progression to end-stage renal failure among patients with chronic kidney disease. However, given the various limitations of the meta-analysis providing evidence for the protective effects of Klotho protein on the cardiovascular and renal systems, there is a clear need for further clinical studies on its potential therapeutic applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In the study by L&#225;zaro et al. (2024), it was found that following cardiac rehabilitation after acute cardiac syndrome, plasma concentrations of Klotho protein increase without significant changes in other components of mineral metabolism. Further studies in this area should clarify whether this effect is associated with clinical benefits during cardiac rehabilitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The results of many studies to date confirm the importance of the Klotho protein as a new biomarker of acute left ventricular injury immediately after MI. They also point to the Klotho protein as a new component of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing cardiac events and their consequences in the course of ischemic heart disease. Collectively, these findings highlight Klotho&#8217;s crucial role in maintaining proper heart function, and its adequate expression in the heart or corresponding levels in the organism may have protective effects during MI, potentially preventing the development of IRI or mitigating its consequences.</p><p id="Par45">The discrepancy in Klotho gene and protein levels in our study should be discussed. It could be explained by some regulatory mechanisms like post-transcriptional regulation, translation efficiency, or protein degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. It was revealed that alterations in transcription are linked to translational changes that have opposing effects on the resulting protein levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Scientists emphasise that high mRNA does not guarantee high protein expression, due to regulatory complexities in gene expression and protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. For example, it is not anticipated that induced transcription will immediately result in higher protein levels during stress conditions, as mRNA maturation, export, and translation processes require time. Therefore, there is a delay between the induction of transcription and the subsequent increase in protein levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. It was also reported that under anaerobic conditions, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can bind to target mRNAs and repress their translation as part of the cellular adaptation to hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Alternatively, evidence supports a negative feedback mechanism, where the presence/accumulation of a protein, both intracellularly and extracellularly, can lead to decreased transcription of its encoding mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. This could also explain why Klotho administration did not substantially alter the protein synthesis in our study, but more likely influenced the expression of the Klotho gene after IRI in the heart tissue. The half-life of Klotho mRNA remains poorly defined in cardiac tissue, with published values ranging widely across models. Alternative Klotho transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs) have also been shown to be degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), further supporting the idea of dynamic regulation and rapid mRNA turnover under certain conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Direct evaluation of mRNA stability and Klotho protein degradation dynamics may help clarify the regulatory mechanisms involved. Notably, differences in Klotho gene and protein expression were observed between the in vitro HCM model and the ex vivo perfused rat hearts. These discrepancies may stem from species-specific regulatory factors as well as the inherent biological complexity of whole cardiac tissue, which includes interactions among multiple cell types absent in isolated cardiomyocyte cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Such variability underscores the importance of employing both models to gain a comprehensive understanding of Klotho&#8217;s effects. While this may present challenges for direct translatability, the consistent cardioprotective outcome observed across both systems supports the therapeutic potential of Klotho in the setting of IRI. Additionally, the unchanged ADAM17 levels in the IRI group, despite the lower levels of Klotho protein, suggest that IRI did not affect ADAM17 expression directly and hence, ADAM17 did not contribute to Klotho level regulation under stress conditions. This stability could suggest that other compensatory mechanisms or pathways are at play that maintain ADAM17 levels despite the stress of IRI. The decrease in ADAM17 synthesis after Klotho may indicate some feedback inhibition or protective mechanisms activated by Klotho. However, additional experiments that could clarify these mechanisms in future studies are needed.</p><p id="Par46">It has been well established that overproduction of ROS and RNS, along with the resulting oxidative/nitrosative stress during IRI occurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The formation of NO from L-arginine and its bioactivity is regulated by NOS isoenzymes like eNOS, iNOS, neuronal NOS, as well as by endogenous NOS inhibitor - ADMA, and DDAH, a key enzyme that metabolises ADMA. This process is oxygen-dependent, with synthesis rates being proportional to the oxygen concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. It is known that NOS&#8217;s expression changes lead to disturbed NO production, while iNOS can produce large amounts of cytotoxic NO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. While NO typically acts as a vasodilator in the endothelium and serves as a scavenger of free radicals, during oxidative stress, it can react with O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8226;&#8722;</sup> to form ONOO<sup>&#8722;</sup>. ONOO<sup>&#8722;</sup> is a highly reactive oxidant and nitrating agent that can cause significant damage to myocardial tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The present study showed an increased level of eNOS protein in hearts subjected to IRI, whilst the expression of the eNOS gene was lower. The lowered expression of the iNOS gene in HCM was also observed, while the iNOS gene and protein expression were enhanced in rat hearts. This diversity between the NOS gene and protein expression can be explained by the fact that eNOS is constitutively expressed and regulated by transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational modifications, whereas iNOS is induced primarily by gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. It is known that cells can regulate the rate of protein synthesis by altering translation efficiency. For instance, specific regulatory elements within the mRNA or interactions with non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs, can either promote or inhibit translation, thereby compensating for fluctuations in mRNA levels. The negative feedback mechanisms, previously discussed, can also be taken into consideration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Our results also highlight that regulatory mechanisms in tissue may not be faithfully mimicked by cell models. Cells can exhibit significant gene expression and transcriptional differences compared to tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Further studies are warranted to investigate these discrepancies using more advanced models, such as 3D cardiac co-cultures, organoids, or single-cell transcriptomics. In this study, eNOS and iNOS levels positively correlated with (NO<sub>x</sub>)<sup>&#8722;</sup>, suggesting a possible relationship of NOSs with the overproduction of NO and its oxidative products that follow. We also observed a positive correlation of ADMA with iNOS, (NO<sub>x</sub>)<sup>&#8722;</sup> and DDAH1. The data indicate co-occurrence, which may reflect a possible pathway where nitrosative stress induced ADMA expression, followed by adequate enhancement in DDAH1, which degraded ADMA during IRI. This could be why there was no difference in ADMA level between the aero and IRI groups, but further mechanistic validation is needed to define causality. Our observations agree with the general thesis of the detrimental role of NOSs during heart IRI or MI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. It was proven that during IRI, eNOS-derived NO promotes vasodilation, improving blood flow to ischemic tissues and reducing myocardial injury. eNOS activation was associated with better cardiac function and reduced infarct size post-MI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the induced synthesis of NO by eNOS during IRI contributes to the ONOO<sup>&#8722;</sup> formation and increases oxidative stress within cells, which has important pathological implications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Thus, the higher expression of NOS proteins in the IRI group may be a compensatory mechanism to enhance NO production during reperfusion in our study. ROS production and oxidative stress can be enhanced by NOS &#8220;uncoupling&#8221;, where NOS produces O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8226;&#8722;</sup> instead of NO. This phenomenon can be observed in eNOS and iNOS, and can be induced by ADMA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The NOS uncoupling might paradoxically result in increased (NO<sub>x</sub>)<sup>&#8722;</sup> levels due to the reaction between O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8226;&#8722;</sup> and NO, forming ONOO<sup>&#8722;</sup>, which can further decompose into nitrate and nitrite. It was also reported that combined exercise training and eNOS overexpression had detrimental effects after MI in mice due to increased oxidative stress from eNOS uncoupling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The expression of eNOS was elevated in the mouse cardiac tissue after MI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Increased iNOS activity and subsequent NO and ROS production have also been associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy, endothelial dysfunction and failing heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Importantly, here we reported that supplementation of the hearts with Klotho protein contributed to the regulation of eNOS and iNOS gene and protein expression, which resulted in reduced (NO<sub>x</sub>)<sup>&#8722;</sup> synthesis and protection against nitrosative stress. The decrease in NOS levels in the IRI&#8201;+&#8201;Klotho group led to a reduction in ADMA production, because (NO<sub>x</sub>)<sup>&#8722;</sup> levels declined, eliminating the need for competitive inhibition of NOS. This was accompanied by a decrease in DDAH level. It shows that Klotho contributed to the regulation of the NOS/NO pathway.</p><p id="Par47">Oxidative stress leads to cell damage and death, resulting from the cumulative effects of DNA, protein, and lipid peroxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. This study observed significant protein oxidation in IRI hearts as an oxidative stress marker. The positive correlation of protein oxidation with eNOS, iNOS and (NO<sub>x</sub>)<sup>&#8722;</sup> levels may suggest a potential link between NOS activity and oxidative/nitrosative stress during IRI. However, these correlations are associative and do not establish a causal relationship, which requires further analysis. Then, IRI increased the utility of free fatty acids in the heart, while generating large amounts of lipid peroxidation products. The level of FFA negatively correlated with protein and lipid oxidation, and positively correlated with iNOS level, which may indicate a possible alteration in fatty acid metabolism during oxidative/nitrosative stress. It was established that IRI alters the metabolism of fatty acids, which are the most significant energy suppliers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Myocardial ischemia leads to the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, resulting in its accumulation and aggravation of heart injury. However, restoring oxygen supply during reperfusion can cause a temporary overshoot in oxidative metabolism, leading to an increased rate of fatty acid oxidation. Increased fatty acid uptake and metabolism can further deplete fatty acid levels, as the tissues rapidly attempt to restore energy balance. Importantly, abnormal metabolism of fatty acids during IRI stimulates ROS production in cardiac mitochondria, exacerbating cardiac injury as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The consequence of oxidative stress is also lipid peroxidation, where ROS damage free fatty acids and other lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. This oxidative damage can reduce the available pool of functional FFAs, contributing to the lower levels observed in the IRI group. What is important in this study, perfusion of the hearts with Klotho protein reduced oxidative stress and regulated the metabolism of fatty acids to the levels observed in aerobic conditions. It was reported that restoration of higher FFA levels was related to the preservation of systolic function in diabetic rats after MI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Then, Klotho protected the podocytes against oxidative stress in palmitate-induced injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. In men after sprint interval training, the level of Klotho in the blood was positively correlated with FFA level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. It should be noted that Klotho is strongly related to oxidative stress defence. Our previous studies demonstrated that Klotho regulated redox balance and supported metabolic homeostasis of human cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Then, Klotho prevented oxidative stress after rat heart IRI via insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R)/phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signalling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. In 2023, Wang et al. reported that Klotho improved cardiac fibrosis, inflammation, ferroptosis, and oxidative stress by regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target-of-rapamycin (mTOR) signalling in mice with MI in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Administration of exogenous Klotho protein reduced intracellular levels of ROS and sterile inflammation in peri-infarct regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and reduced oxidative stress via SIRT1 signalling after myocardial IRI in rats as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Interestingly, HIIT-induced increase in plasma and myocardial levels of Klotho<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> or Klotho gene overexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> was related to enhancement in antioxidant production, thus reducing oxidative stress in rats after IRI. Based on these previous findings, Klotho could modulate NOS and MMP activity through the regulation of redox-sensitive signalling pathways such as IGF1R/PI3K/AKT, AMPK/mTOR, or SIRT1, which requires future mechanistic studies. In summary, this study highlights the importance of Klotho&#8217;s cardioprotective ability against oxidative stress.</p><p id="Par48">ROS can directly alter heart contractile proteins, which are associated with apoptosis and the activation of kinases and transcription factors involved in cardiac hypertrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. ONOO<sup>&#8722;</sup> can be formed from (NO<sub>x</sub>)<sup>&#8722;</sup> and can lead to protein carbonylation and MMP activation, along with other ROS/RNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. MMPs, including MMP-2 and MMP-9, are key proteolytic enzymes that degrade extracellular matrix proteins, are involved in extracellular matrix remodelling, and can be inhibited by TIMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. During oxidative and nitrosative stress, the phosphorylation, nitration, and nitrosylation levels of myocardial contractile proteins by (NO<sub>x</sub>)<sup>&#8722;</sup> and ROS increase. These modified proteins are subsequently degraded by MMPs, resulting in impaired cardiac contractility. The contractile dysfunctions observed during IRI are linked to the degradation of troponin, titin, and myosin light chains (MLCs) by MMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This study reported significantly increased levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins in hearts injured by ischemia/reperfusion. The activity of MMP-2 was also enhanced, and positively correlated with MMP-2 protein level, (NO<sub>x</sub>)<sup>&#8722;</sup> level and protein oxidation. The positive correlation of MMP-9 protein with iNOS and (NO<sub>x</sub>)<sup>&#8722;</sup> levels was also reported. These findings suggest a possible relationship between oxidative and nitrosative stress with MMP synthesis and activation. Then, we found an intensified synthesis of MMP inhibitors, TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 during IRI, and a correlation of TIMP-2 with MMP-2 and MMP-9, which may reflect a cell reaction to high levels of MMPs. However, the observed associations should be interpreted as indicative of concurrent alterations rather than direct regulatory effects. Aligning with the thesis that TIMP-4 interacts with and inhibits ADAM17<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, there was a negative correlation between TIMP-4 and ADAM17 levels. However, the effectiveness of TIMP-4 is limited compared to stronger inhibitors like TIMP-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Importantly, we report that Klotho contributed to the limitation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 synthesis/activity, and regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene expression. As a result of MMPs regulation, the level of TIMP-2 was also reduced in the IRI&#8201;+&#8201;Klotho group. These results are consistent with our previous report on IRI of human cardiomyocytes, where Klotho supplementation decreased the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9, thus protecting against MMP-dependent degradation of contractile proteins like MLC1 and troponin I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Next, we showed that Klotho decreased tissue injury, enhanced antioxidant capacity, and reduced degradation of contractile proteins, supporting the heart&#8217;s function in the rat heart IRI ex vivo model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were higher in human cardiac myocytes with Klotho deficiency and subjected to the fibrotic environment, which was mitigated during Klotho overexpression in these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Then, reduced levels of Klotho were related to increased expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and atherosclerosis in the primary human aortic smooth muscle cells and diabetic mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Wu et al. (2023) revealed that the absence of Klotho in the mouse lacrimal gland resulted in oxidative stress, followed by an increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression, extracellular matrix remodelling, fibrosis, and cell atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Klotho-deficient mice also showed an increase in MMP-8, MMP-9, and MMP-12 levels in the lungs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Contrary, the inhibition of MMP and extracellular matrix degradation by Klotho was reported in nucleus pulposus cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Klotho gene overexpression decreased the levels of aortic MMP-2 and MMP-9 related to systolic hypertension and arterial stiffness in senescence-accelerated and old mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. All of the above emphasise Klotho&#8217;s contribution to protection related to the inhibition of MMPs, and as we showed, to cardioprotection during IRI as well. Unlike our previous study, which was limited to an in vitro human cardiomyocyte model and focused primarily on MMP-mediated contractile protein degradation, the present work expands the investigation to an ex vivo isolated rat heart model, providing an initial analysis of the NOS/(NO<sub>x</sub>)<sup>&#8722;</sup>/MMP signalling axis and the effect of Klotho on oxidative/nitrosative stress and extracellular matrix regulation at the tissue level.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Summary</title><p id="Par50">To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that Klotho protein protects against oxidative stress via regulation of the NOS/MMP pathway in the heart IRI ex vivo model.</p><p id="Par51">The highlights of this study are as follows:</p><p id="Par52">

</p><p id="Par56">The findings we have presented are part of the basic sciences embracing the most crucial problems of modern cardiology, which include the consequences of ischemia and reperfusion in the myocardium. Further research on the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion and also on oxidative stress is particularly important, as it allows to understand the essence of these processes. Thus, it creates the basis and possibilities for the development of effective therapeutic methods, particularly in the context of myocardial infarction and heart failure, where oxidative and nitrosative stress play critical roles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par58">We recognise that our study indicates a potential trend, but the absence of detailed mechanistic insights prevents a precise understanding of this phenomenon. Notably, this research represents an initial exploration of the NOS/MMP pathway associated with oxidative stress and heart injury, laying the groundwork for more targeted and detailed analyses in future studies, including inhibitors, activators, or genetic models. These limitations underscore the need for further research to uncover the specific molecular mechanisms through which Klotho influences NOS and MMP activity. Thus, the next step should be the evaluation of Klotho&#8217;s effect on NOS/MMP signalling using an in vivo animal model. The exogenous Klotho protein concentrations used in the in vivo HCM culture and ex vivo rat heart perfusion differ due to model-specific requirements. The selected doses represent the most effective non-toxic concentrations validated in prior studies, and direct comparison across models should be interpreted with caution. It also remains unclear whether Klotho acts as a cardioprotective agent, a therapeutic intervention, or both. Consequently, this study focused on the peri-infarction period, administering Klotho protein shortly before and after global ischemia. More precisely, in the ex vivo studies, Klotho was administered during the late stabilisation and early reperfusion phases to mimic the acute clinical setting and to assess its potential both as a preventive and early therapeutic agent. This approach aimed to evaluate whether early Klotho delivery could modulate the pathway before irreversible myocardial injury occurs. Although alternative timings were not explored in the current study due to model limitations, our findings provide a foundation for future in vivo studies to investigate the optimal therapeutic window for Klotho administration. While our results highlight the therapeutic potential of Klotho in myocardial IRI, its clinical translation faces several challenges. Recombinant Klotho has a short half-life, limited stability in circulation, and is rapidly cleared, which complicates its use in acute conditions like MI. Optimal dosing, timing, and delivery route remain undefined, and no clinically approved formulation currently exists. Future studies should explore improved delivery systems or alternative approaches, such as Klotho-mimetics or inducers of endogenous expression, to overcome these limitations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Conceptualisation: AO; Methodology: AO; Animal Handling: IS; Formal Analysis: AO and IB-L; Investigation: AO; AK-Z, IB-L; Resources: AO and IB-L; Data Curation: AO; Writing &#8211; Original Draft Preparation: AO; Writing &#8211; Review &amp; Editing: IB-L and AM; Supervision: IB-L; Project Administration: AO; Funding Acquisition: AO.</p></notes><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by the National Science Centre Poland (grant number 2019/33/N/NZ3/01649).</p></notes><notes notes-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p></notes><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar1" notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par67">The authors declare no competing interests.</p></notes></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Kalogeris, T. et al.
