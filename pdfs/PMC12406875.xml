One of the main causes of IH events in preterm infants is apnoea of prematurity (AOP).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 2</sup></xref> These apnoeas can be central (no neural drive to breathe), obstructive (upper airway obstruction) or mixed (features of central and obstructive present) in nature.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Although short apnoeic periods and periodic breathing itself have not been shown to be harmful, increasing evidence is emerging that IH lasting &gt;1&#8201;min are associated with long-term morbidities.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4 5</sup></xref></p><p>Therefore, prevention of apnoea resulting in prolonged hypoxaemia is critical. To enable prevention and timely intervention, adequate continuous monitoring of the infants&#8217; cardiorespiratory status is necessary. In addition to oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate, monitoring spontaneous breathing effort is key to detecting apnoea. Chest impedance (CI) and/or flow measurement(s) are the most widely used techniques for breaths detection, but these techniques can be inaccurate in infants on non-invasive respiratory support. Both non-breathing-related thoracic movements in awake and active infants, as well as air leakages at the patient interface, make it difficult to accurately assess respiration, and thus, detect apnoea.</p><p>Transcutaneous diaphragmatic electromyography (dEMG) is a promising technique to overcome these limitations. dEMG measures the electrical activity of the diaphragm, the primary muscle responsible for breathing in (preterm) infants. The diaphragmatic activity provides insight into the infant&#8217;s breathing pattern and the measured signal is suitable for detecting AOP.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6 7</sup></xref> Furthermore, dEMG can also quantify the breathing effort.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8 9</sup></xref> Recently, it has been shown that dEMG can also be measured with standard ECG/CI electrodes, by repositioning the electrodes to the costal-abdominal margin.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> This makes it possible to continuously assess diaphragm activity, without the need for additional skin electrodes on the infant&#8217;s chest or special dEMG equipment. Even though previous research has shown that the dEMG signal can be used to distinguish between the different types of apnoea events, the dEMG signal has not yet been used to describe the activity pattern of the diaphragm prior to and during an IH event.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>Therefore, this study aims to describe the activity of the diaphragm before and during IH events in preterm infants. We hypothesise that the diaphragm&#8217;s activity changes markedly prior to an IH event and that different types of apnoea will show different diaphragm activity patterns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This single-centre, prospective, observational study was performed in the level III neonatal intensive care unit of the Emma Children&#8217;s Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Patients or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of this study.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>Enrolment criteria were: a postmenstrual age between 26 and 34 weeks, on non-invasive respiratory support, standard cardiorespiratory monitoring using ECG/CI and IH events &gt;1/hour, with or without tactile stimulation.

The patients could not be involved in the design, recruitment, conduction and dissemination of results of this study. Neither could we ask the participants about the burden of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Study protocol</title><p>To perform the dEMG measurement, the standard ECG electrodes (RedDot, 3M, USA) were repositioned to the diaphragm area for a 24-hour measurement, two active electrodes bilateral at the costal margin in the midclavicular line and one reference on the sternum, as described previously.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> During the measurement, standard ECG monitoring was continued by choosing the ECG lead with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. SpO<sub>2</sub> was measured peripherally using photoplethysmography. All signals were presented on the patient monitor (Intellivue MX750; Philips Healthcare, Eindhoven, the Netherlands) and stored in a secured cloud-based database (Snowflake, Montana, USA) at a sample rate of 500&#8201;Hz. dEMG signal analysis was performed offline after data extraction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The respiratory breathing waveform was derived from the dEMG measurements, by filtering baseline noise and removing cardiac interface with the gating technique, as described previously.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10 11</sup></xref> Using the recorded SpO<sub>2</sub> data, all desaturations below 80% were defined as potential IH events and subjected to a detailed assessment of the SpO<sub>2</sub>, HR and dEMG activity, prior to and during the event.</p><p>Segments of dEMG data from 5&#8201;min prior to the end of the selected IH event were extracted. Event plots were then created, showing SpO<sub>2</sub> (which defined IH) and dEMG activity. Subsequently, two assessors (GJH and RWvL) independently assessed the dEMG and SpO<sub>2</sub> data prior to and during the IH event and classified the events as central, obstructive, mixed AOP or noise. An event was scored as central if diaphragmatic activity decreased (a drop of at least 50% activity) and no breathing activity could be identified. Obstructive was defined as an increased inspiratory diaphragmatic activity compared with baseline (increase of at least 50%), although the patient still (subsequently) desaturated, suggesting effort against an obstructed upper airway (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). In cases where a short period (5&#8211;10&#8201;s) of no dEMG activity (ie,central features) was followed by a period of increased activity (ie, obstructive features), or vice versa, this event was scored as a mixed event. An event was scored as noise when either the dEMG or SpO<sub>2</sub> signal was deemed uninterpretable. Disagreement in classification was resolved by asking the opinion of a third assessor (LA). If there were multiple scored desaturations below 80% within 1&#8201;min or if the SpO<sub>2</sub> between multiple desaturations did not increase above 90%, these separate periods were scored as a single IH event.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Representative plots of IH events used for scoring the event as central (A) or obstructive (B).

As a proxy for the base and average maximum inspiratory activity of the diaphragm, the minimum (dEMG<sub>min</sub>) and maximum (dEMG<sub>max</sub>) diaphragm activity values were determined each second.</p><p>To assess diaphragm activity over time, the dEMG data were divided into three windows: from 5 to 1&#8201;min prior to the hypoxaemia event, 1&#8201;min prior till the start of the hypoxaemia event and during the actual hypoxaemia event (with variable length, dependent on the duration of the desaturation). When multiple events were merged, the first drop in saturation was defined as the start of the event. Lastly, the continuous (1&#8201;s) data were used as well to visually assess and describe the trends in diaphragm activity, HR and SpO<sub>2</sub> prior to and during the IH event. To investigate the overall behaviour, all these single-event traces were averaged to describe the overall diaphragmatic activity during a central, obstructive or mixed apnoea event.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>No formal sample size could be calculated in this study. Therefore, we aimed for a convenience sample of 20 infants. The average activity for each of the three different time windows was calculated, followed by comparative analysis between the different time windows. The diaphragmatic activity was also compared between the different types of apnoea. Analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis testing was used with post hoc testing when appropriate. The statistical analyses were performed in SPSS (V.28; IBM).

Mixed events showed a more prominent drop in SpO<sub>2</sub>&#160;compared with HR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study that assessed changes in diaphragmatic activity before and during IH events in preterm infants. The results show that changes in diaphragmatic activity differ between different types of apnoea events. Central apnoea events can be characterised by a decline in dEMG activity before desaturation, while obstructive apnoea events show an increase in dEMG activity, prior to desaturation. Notably, mixed events did not show a clear dEMG pattern.</p><p>Similar to previous studies, the most frequently occurring events in our cohort of preterm infants were obstructive and mixed apnoea.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3 12 13</sup></xref> However, it is important to note that these studies used different techniques to measure spontaneous breathing, such as changes in flow at the airway opening or CI. Both these techniques have important flaws as they can be hampered by air leakage or breathing-unrelated chest movements, which may compromise their accuracy in classifying apnoea.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7 14 15</sup></xref> In this study, events were scored using dEMG, a relatively new approach as it directly measures the activity of the main respiratory muscle. This difference in measurement technique could also explain the differences in distribution between the three types of apnoea. Where previous studies showed less obstructive apnoea, most likely dEMG can detect more obstructive apnoea, with a reduction in central/mixed events.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13 16</sup></xref></p><p>The current study adds knowledge on the performance and use of dEMG as a monitoring tool, as we performed long-term dEMG measurements, during which changes in body position, nursing interventions and kangaroo care were present, that to date have not been described yet. Furthermore, we used standard ECG equipment with repositioned electrodes, facilitating continuous dEMG assessment in clinical practice.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Although longer measurements naturally come with more signal artefacts, we demonstrate that it is feasible to investigate the occurrence of IH events with an acceptable percentage of noisy data.</p><p>The clinical relevance of monitoring IH events is evident, and besides introducing a novel technique, our study also shows the ability to gain better insight into the origin of an IH event using dEMG. Our results are complementary to the study of Gaertner <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>, who used a different monitoring technique to assess lung volume changes during IH events.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> While our results show a gradual decrease in diaphragm activity in central events, they observed that lung volume decreases during IH events and recovers in the first five breaths after the apnoea. This gradual decrease was also seen in SpO<sub>2</sub> during central events, which suggests that when breathing stops, the available oxygen is consumed and the saturation drops gradually. On the other hand, during obstructive events, the saturation dropped more suddenly, possibly due to the higher metabolic demand as a result of the increased effort to reopen the airways. Combining these findings suggests that the fall in diaphragm activity leads to a drop in lung volume, resulting in an oxygen desaturation, that is, an IH event. Together, these results provide a comprehensive image of the physiology and highlight the importance of optimal monitoring of the respiratory status of preterm infants, preferably multimodular.</p><p>The aetiology of bradycardia accompanying an apnoea event remains uncertain, but it is hypothesised that the decrease in HR is secondary to hypoxaemia or induced by inhibitory reflexes via laryngeal afferents.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 18</sup></xref> If the HR response is considered secondary, the expected sequence is a decline in SpO<sub>2</sub>, followed by alterations in HR. However, our findings challenge this assumption, as HR sometimes tends to drop prior to desaturation during central events. Several factors might play a role in this finding, including the averaging time of the saturation sensor or the physiological inhibitory reflexes during the event. The relationship between apnoea, bradycardia and the role of laryngeal receptors needs further investigation, as their interaction is not yet fully understood in preterm infants.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>When interpreting the results, it is important to note that no formal definition exists on when a dEMG signal is defined as being apnoeic. An additional breathing reference signal is ideally required to formally define apnoea detected by dEMG. However, as previous studies have shown (1) good agreement between dEMG and respiratory rate<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and (2) studies measuring diaphragm activity through the transoesophageal route use similar classifications,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> no extra reference signal was recorded in this study. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the fact the scoring was done solely based on dEMG could have introduced a risk of bias with respect to the outcome measures on dEMG signal strength.</p><p>Another limitation is the fact that during the 24-hour measurements, no annotations were made regarding clinical events (eg, whether the nurse had to stimulate the patient), which could have influenced the interpretation of signal artefacts. Lastly, in a future study, it could be very interesting to split mixed events into two categories: those starting with an obstructive component and those that initiate with a central component. In that way, the physiology of these events can be better understood. Now, we hypothesise that, based on the current results, obstructive and central components levelled each other out, resulting in an overall stable dEMG pattern.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Although the reduction and increase in diaphragmatic activity during, respectively, central and obstructive apnoea is not a new finding, the fact that these changes already start 30&#8201;s up to 2&#8201;min prior to the actual desaturation is very intriguing and has not been described before. It provides an interesting window for clinical intervention to prevent severe and prolonged IH. The data collected in this study support future steps to develop an online software algorithm capable of early detection of apnoea events from the dEMG signal and classifying them as central, obstructive or mixed. Adding saturation and heart rate signal features to the dEMG signal features might further improve the performance of such an algorithm. Pilot apnoea detection algorithms are already being published, based on other signals than dEMG.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20 21</sup></xref> In any algorithm, signal artefacts must be managed in real-time, to prevent false detection or missing an event. The use of such an algorithm could improve the clinical outcome of these premature infants by enabling earlier intervention and adjusting clinical treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrates dEMG is a reliable technique for detecting changes in breathing pattern, that is, diaphragm activity, prior to an IH event, possibly enabling early intervention. A significant decrease and increase in dEMG activity were measured in central and obstructive IH events, respectively. Future research should focus on developing an automatic detection of these events using dEMG, and further investigate the origin of mixed events to enhance the classification and treatment of IH events.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all parents for their consent to participate their child in the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Data availability free text:</bold> Data are available on reasonable request.
