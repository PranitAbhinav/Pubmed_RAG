These measures support routine outcome monitoring of change and outcomes in mental health interventions (Evans et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>). The CORE-OM, where OM stands for outcome measure, is the central measure of this system and comprises 34 items that measure four domains of psychological distress: well-being (4 items), problems/symptoms (12 items), functioning (12 items), and risk (6 items).
</p><p id="Par18">Several short forms have been derived from the CORE-OM, each created by selecting specific sets of items from the original 34-item measure to serve different purposes. One purpose was to reduce the burden of completion of the measure when offered on&#160;session by session. In this regard, two parallel forms of 18 items were created at the launch of the CORE system in 1998, called&#160;Short Form A (SFA) and Short Form B (SFB). These forms were created with the intention&#160;being used alternately during therapies to minimize memory effects. Later, the CORE-10 (Barkham et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>), an even shorter form with only 10 items, was generated to provide a simpler repeat-use short form. The other reason for the creation of another short form was to have a measure suitable for the general population: GP-CORE (Evans et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>). This measure&#160;has only 14 items omitting risk domain items and other high-tuned items of the CORE-OM. By selecting and adapting subsets of items from the full CORE-OM, these short forms maintain the overall structure and validity of the original measure while offering flexibility for different contexts and populations.</p><p id="Par19">These measures were selected for the present study due to their well-established role in routine outcome monitoring worldwide and their flexibility to be used across clinical and non-clinical populations. These measures are copyleft, meaning they can be used without charges if they are not modified. The CORE-OM, and therefore all items included in the short forms, have been translated into more than 30 languages, including Spanish. By the end of 2021, 562 peer-reviewed papers using CORE measures had been published in English or Spanish, including 71 reporting data from non-clinical samples. The Spanish translation was conducted in Spain, and to date, only one psychometric study has been conducted in the country (Trujillo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>). That study analyzed responses to the CORE-OM from 192 participants in a clinical sample and 452 participants in a non-clinical sample, which included 127 community volunteers and 325 university students. In total, 78 participants from the non-clinical sample participated in a retest that occurred 15 to 30&#160;days after the first administration. Although this study provided valuable information about the psychometric properties of the CORE-OM, there is still a lack of information about these properties for the short forms derived from the CORE-OM, limiting their use in Spanish.</p><p id="Par20">With this background, the present study aims to address the following research question: What are the acceptability, reliability, and score distributions of the CORE-OM and its derived short forms (CORE-SFA, CORE-SFB, CORE-10, and GP-CORE) in a larger sample of the non-help-seeking Spanish population? We examined all embedded versions of the CORE system, as they span a range of applications&#8212;from clinical assessment (CORE-OM and its derivatives) to evaluations in the general population (GP-CORE). These measures are particularly relevant as they not only capture the multidimensional nature of psychological distress but also address the need for robust, Spanish-language tools for outcome monitoring and clinical assessment across diverse settings.</p><p id="Par21">Alongside evaluating psychometric properties, we aim to establish a reference dataset specific to the Spanish population for the various forms of the CORE system. This reference dataset includes quantiles, which serve as a valuable resource for contextualizing individual scores in relation to the general non-help-seeking population. In psychotherapy research and clinical practice, the &#8220;Clinical Significant Change&#8221; (CSC) methodology introduced by Jacobson and Truax in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1991</xref> is used with a binary classification that categorizes individuals into either the help-seeking (clinical) or non-help-seeking (general) distribution. Routine use of the CSC methods gains considerably when large non-help-seeking datasets contribute their means and SDs to the calculation of the CSC cutting point. However, by employing quantiles, clinicians and researchers gain the ability to not only compare scores above or below the CSC threshold but also to assess their placement within a broader distribution, allowing for a more comprehensive and nuanced analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par22">This study utilized a convenience sampling method. Undergraduate psychology students at the&#160;Universidad Nacional de Educaci&#243;n a Distancia (UNED) across Spain were tasked with recruiting participants from their personal networks as part of a class project designed to enhance their understanding of the psychological assessment process. They were encouraged to identify and invite two to three individuals who met the study&#8217;s inclusion criteria. These criteria required participants to be adults (18&#160;years or older), residing in Spain, without psychological diagnosis and not undergoing psychological treatment.</p><p id="Par23">Students were provided with clear instructions on the recruitment process to ensure ethical practices. This included informing potential participants about the voluntary nature of the study, explaining the study&#8217;s purpose, and emphasizing that their responses would remain anonymous and confidential. Participants were also required to provide informed consent before taking part in the research. This approach facilitated the collection of data from a non-help-seeking population across various regions of the country.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Measures</title><p id="Par24">CORE System Measures: the CORE-OM items are scored on a five-point Likert scale from 0 (&#8220;not at all&#8221;) to 4 (&#8220;most or all of the time&#8221;), with higher scores indicating higher levels of psychological distress. The CORE-OM was translated into Spanish in Spain (Trujillo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>), and it has demonstrated good internal consistency for the total score (&#945;&#8201;=&#8201;0.92, 95% CI [0.90, 0.94]) and for the non-risk items score (&#945;&#8201;=&#8201;0.93, 95% CI [0.91, 0.95]) when used with community samples, similar to the results found for the original version in the UK ( Evans et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>), total score &#945;&#8201;=&#8201;0.94, 95% CI [0.93, 0.93], non-risk items &#945;&#8201;=&#8201;0.94, 95% CI [0.94, 0.95].</p><p id="Par25">The embedded measures within the CORE-OM include the CORE-SFA (18 items), CORE-SFB (18 items), GP-CORE (14 items) and CORE-10 (10 items). Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents the mapping of the CORE-OM items included in each of the shorter forms. The psychometric properties of the CORE-10 have been explored in the UK by Barkham et al.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2024</xref>) with a help-seeking sample, showing similar results (&#945;&#8201;=&#8201;0.81, 95% CI [0.78, 0.84]).

Those who expressed interest in participating were informed about the study&#8217;s objectives, and a consent form was provided to them. Participants who agreed to take part signed a written&#160;consent and confidentiality form.</p><p id="Par27">All participants then provided sociodemographic information, including age, gender, education, marital status, employment status, nationality, and province of residence in Spain. Afterward, they completed several questionnaires, including the CORE-OM. The other questionnaires&#160;administered were the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, NEO Five-Factor Inventory, Inventory of Stressful Life Events, Childhood Abuse Assessment, Social Vulnerability Resilience Scale, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, Past Adverse Situations, Current Adverse Situations, Cognitive Emotional Dysfunction Test, Relationship Questionnaire, and the Repertory Grid: Repertory Grid Technique (commonly used in Personal Construct Theory). In the 2010&#8211;2011 cohort, participants were contacted again after 6&#160;months to complete the questionnaires once more. In the 2012&#8211;2013 cohort, participants were contacted for the same purpose after 1&#160;week.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Analyses</title><p id="Par28">The analyses followed the Problem, Plan, Data, Analyses, Conclusions and Communication (PPDAC) framework (MacKay &amp; Oldford, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2000</xref>; Spiegelhalter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>). The identified Problem was the lack of information about the reliability and distribution of the scores for the various forms of the CORE system embedded with the CORE-OM. The plan was to analyze responses to the CORE-OM (Data) from a community sample collected between 2010 and 2018.</p><p id="Par29">The analyses focused on four objectives. First, to describe the characteristics of the sample, we reported the mean, standard deviation, median, and confidence intervals for age (the only continuous variable), while frequencies were reported for other sociodemographic variables, with all these variables reported by tranche. Second, to assess the measure's acceptability, the omission rate was calculated for each item and each form. Third, to evaluate the reliability of the CORE-OM scores and the embedded short forms of the CORE system, we analyzed internal consistency and test&#8211;retest stability. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach&#8217;s alpha (Cronbach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1951</xref>) and McDonald&#8217;s Omega (&#969;) coefficient for one-factor models (unidimensional measures with continuous items; Flora, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>) for each form.</p><p id="Par30">Test&#8211;retest stability was evaluated by examining Pearson correlation coefficients between assessment occasions and calculating the mean difference and 95% CI between those occasions for each form. For mean change, we reported both Cohen&#8217;s d1 and Cohen&#8217;s dz to allow comparisons with other studies that may have reported one but not the other due to a lack of consensus in the literature. Cohen&#8217;s d1 is calculated as the mean change divided by the standard deviation (SD) of the baseline values, while dz is the mean change divided by the SD of the change values. In test&#8211;retest studies, where a strong positive correlation between first and second scores is typical, dz tends to be larger than d1.</p><p id="Par31">Fourth, we examined the mean differences between scores based on age, gender, and level of education. Based on those results, we reported the descriptive information (mean, Confidence Intervals [CI], minimum, maximum, and standard deviation) of the scores of the different forms of the CORE-OM for each category of the mentioned variables. Finally, we provided the distributions of the scores for each form to be used as reference data.</p><p id="Par32">All the analyses were conducted using R (R Core Team, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>) in RStudio (Posit team, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2022</xref>). Bootstrapped CI, shown as&#160;.xx[.xx,.xx], were calculated for Cronbach&#8217;s alpha coefficient, Pearson&#8217;s correlation, mean differences, and percentiles using the CECPfuns package (Evans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2021</xref>). This package was also used to generate percentile distribution plots, while the other plots were created using ggplot2 (Wickham, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Characteristics of the sample</title><p id="Par33">In total, we analyzed the data of 1667 participants.

However, in their study, the most frequently omitted items were item 3, &#8220;I have felt I have someone to turn to for support when needed,&#8221; and item, 25 &#8220;I have felt criticized by other people,&#8221; both from the Functioning domain and associated with interpersonal interactions. In contrast, our study identified item 34, &#8220;I have hurt myself physically or taken dangerous risks with my health,&#8221; which pertains to the risk domain, as the most omitted item. The reason for this difference is unclear, as the omission rates for these items were low in both studies, measuring less than 1%.</p><p id="Par49">Regarding floor effects, we observed a notably high proportion of responses at the minimum value (i.e., 0) for items within the risk domain. These effects may be attributed to the nature of the population under study&#8212;a non-help-seeking population. The floor effects of risk scores in non-help-seeking populations can impact the measurement of the construct, potentially leading to an underestimation of psychological difficulties. To address this, Nonetheless, we have reported non-risk score distributions to address this issue and provide a more balanced perspective.</p><p id="Par50">Regarding reliability, as anticipated, internal consistency diminishes in accordance with the number of items on the form (i.e., forms with a greater number of items exhibit higher levels of internal consistency). This highlights a key trade-off between brevity and psychometric robustness. Shorter measures like the CORE-10, while practical for clinical use, may compromise reliability by reducing the breadth of content coverage and inter-item correlations. Importantly, reliability may partially reflect the strengths and weaknesses of different CORE measures, providing a valuable metric for selecting forms based on specific research or clinical needs. For instance, the CORE-OM&#8217;s higher reliability underscores its suitability for more comprehensive assessments, while the CORE-10 offers a more pragmatic option for routine use, despite its relatively lower reliability (Valdiviezo-O&#241;a et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2024</xref>).</p><p id="Par51">Upon comparing Cronbach&#8217;s alpha coefficients from our study with those reported in studies conducted in Spain and the UK, we found no significant disparities concerning CORE-OM scores and CORE-OM-NR scores. However, a notable discrepancy emerged between our findings and those for the CORE-10 in the UK (Barkham et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). Although the UK sample is small, it is evident from Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> that the difference between these new Spanish data and the UK data is substantial and unlikely to be due to sampling variability. It seems highly likely that the difference is attributable to the very low rate of non-zero responses in risk items. This also underlines the need for language and culture/country-specific datasets and analyses and the dangers of assuming that psychometric statistics will be stable across languages and localities.</p><p id="Par52">Moreover, the high alpha from the UK sample, with the relatively small size of 77, makes it possible that non-random sampling, which might have made that an unusually high value even for a UK help-seeking population. This highlights the need for further exploration of the internal reliability of the CORE-10, both in embedded and standalone formats, as well as across non-help-seeking populations both English and Spanish-speaking samples. Future research should also investigate whether the lower reliability in shorter forms like the CORE-10 affects their utility in clinical and non-clinical settings, particularly when assessing constructs like risk that rely on sufficient item coverage.</p><p id="Par53">Another difference from the UK findings was that the correlations between assessment occasions were lower than those found in the UK and Spain for the same scores, although all values still reflected acceptable test&#8211;retest reliability. The mean shift between occasions in our data had confidence intervals encompassing zero for both the 1-week and 6-month intervals. This is similar to the findings of the earlier study conducted in Spain (with a 2-week interval) but different from the results of the UK study (with a 1-week interval), where the confidence intervals for differences did not include zero, aligned with the widely noted &#8220;test&#8211;retest artifact&#8221; (Durham et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2002</xref>). We suspect that linguistic and cultural nuances concerning how questionnaires are perceived and understood contribute to the strength of this mean shift. Nonetheless, it would be insightful to gather data from various countries to comprehend the impact of repeated assessment of psychological distress in non-help-seeking populations.</p><p id="Par54">The significant differences observed in score distributions by gender and education suggest the need for further exploration of the underlying factors contributing to these variations. Gender differences in psychological scores may reflect societal constructions that shape emotional expression and the reporting of psychological distress (Compa&#241; Felipe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2024</xref>). For example, women may be more inclined to express and report emotional difficulties, while societal expectations of masculinity may discourage men from acknowledging emotional experiences, thus affecting how distress is perceived and reported. It is worth noting that this gender difference was not observed in the Trujillo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>) study, highlighting the importance of continuing to explore these differences within the Spanish population.</p><p id="Par55">Differences by education level may arise from varying stress levels, coping mechanisms, or differences in mental health awareness (Sironi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>). Individuals with less formal education may face stressors related to socioeconomic status, which could impact their mental well-being and influence their scores on psychological assessments.</p><p id="Par56">In conclusion, gender, education, and other demographic factors likely play an important role in shaping how psychological experiences are reported. These factors should be carefully considered when interpreting psychological scores, and future research could benefit from a more thorough investigation of the societal and psychological mechanisms underlying these differences.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par57">While this study has provided valuable insights into the psychometric properties and score distributions of multiple forms within the CORE system for a non-help-seeking Spanish sample, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations that may affect the interpretation of these findings.</p><p id="Par58">As previously mentioned, the sample is not representative of the entire Spanish population, with individuals with higher education being notably overrepresented due to the use of convenience sampling. Nonetheless, we have included scores categorized by education for the benefit of clinicians and researchers. Given the non-representative nature of the sample, we strongly advise exercising caution when comparing your own data with the distributions presented in this article.</p><p id="Par59">It is also important to note that the analysis of the various CORE family system forms is based on item extraction from the CORE-OM. Consequently, the findings may not fully capture the behavior of the forms when administered individually. Nonetheless, the data provide an approximation of score distributions and psychometric properties for less-explored, shorter forms such as the CORE-SFA, CORE-SFB, GP-CORE, and CORE-10&#8212;forms that may be preferred to reduce respondent burden when completing questionnaires. Further research, employing these forms in isolation, is necessary to confirm their efficacy within this specific population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Potential applications</title><p id="Par60">The current study offers valuable insights into the application of the CORE-OM and its related forms in non-help-seeking populations, providing reference scores that are relevant&#160;in various professional settings.</p><p id="Par61">For clinicians, these findings underscore the importance of considering population-specific characteristics when interpreting psychological distress scores. For example, the floor effects observed in risk items highlight the need for cautious interpretation in non-help-seeking populations, where&#160;the limited variability may obscure subtle signs of psychological distress. These score distributions serve as reference benchmarks for general population studies and as tools for mapping changes in clients across mental health interventions, relative to non-help-seeking score distributions.</p><p id="Par62">In research contexts, the detailed breakdown of scores by gender and education offers a valuable framework for comparative studies. Researchers can use these reference scores to benchmark findings against similar populations or identify outliers that may reflect specific psychological trends in certain subgroups. Additionally, cut-off points for the calculation of clinically significant change (CSC) can be refined using this data in comparison with clinical samples. Moreover, the study&#8217;s findings on reliability and test&#8211;retest stability across different CORE forms provide essential guidance for researchers in selecting the most appropriate tool, balancing the trade-offs between brevity and psychometric rigor. These distributions also enable&#160;comparisons with other non-help-seeking samples and serve as benchmarks for evaluating changes in clients following mental health interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par63">In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the performance of measures within the CORE system when applied to a non-help-seeking Spanish population. Our findings indicate that all forms in the system demonstrate reliability, showing commendable levels of internal consistency and test&#8211;retest reliability. Furthermore, we have presented distributions stratified by gender and education, which serve as a valuable resource for both researchers and clinicians. These distributions can be useful for comparative analyses with other non-help-seeking samples or as benchmarks for assessing the magnitude of change in clients following mental health interventions.</p><p id="Par64">It is important to emphasize that our findings and data offer a preliminary approximation of the properties and distributions characterizing these various forms within the CORE system. We encourage&#160;invite further exploration and investigation in this area, as continued research efforts have the potential to enhance the applicability and effectiveness of the CORE system&#8217;s diverse forms within the Spanish population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
