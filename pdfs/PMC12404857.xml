About 5%&#8211;10% of the fractures result in delayed or nonunion fractures [<xref rid="os70137-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, there are some kinds of fractures that are even more serious by their nature and require immediate intervention and follow&#8208;up. One such common fracture location is the hip bone. The common risk factors for hip fracture cases are sex, age&#8201;&gt;&#8201;65&#8201;years, risk of fall, less physical activity, trauma, etc. [<xref rid="os70137-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="os70137-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Likewise, subtrochanteric fractures in younger adults as well as geriatric patients are more challenging and often require surgery. The incidence of subtrochanteric fractures is higher in the elderly population between the age group of 65 and 85&#8201;years old [<xref rid="os70137-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="os70137-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These fractures often occur within 5&#8201;cm of the lesser trochanter of the proximal femur [<xref rid="os70137-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="os70137-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The most commonly followed practice includes surgery with intramedullary nailing and sliding hip screws [<xref rid="os70137-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="os70137-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="os70137-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although the surgeries in the management of these kinds of fractures are complicated, still there requires an adjunctive treatment to speed up the bone healing process as they have a direct effect on morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="os70137-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While these injuries are considered an important topic on the clinician's side, there is a lack of animal models to study the management of subtrochanteric fractures. The establishment of animal models plays a crucial role in understanding fracture healing mechanisms and the development of new treatments. By developing standardized animal models, it will be very useful to translate the research findings into clinical applications, thereby developing effective therapies for treatments. While there are more investigations going on common hip fractures like femoral neck fractures, there is only very little research on subtrochanteric fractures. This kind of fracture often results in nonunion/malunion due to the unique biomechanics and stress encountered in this region during the fracture event, thereby affecting the blood supply in this area, which further delays the fracture healing process. By creating fractures at this site, our study allows us to fill the sparsely explored research area by investigating its potential clinical benefits. In this study, we have not followed the traditional fixation method like IM nailing because creating IM nailing in a small animal model is quite complicated surgery as the entry and exit point will affect the stability of the fixation. We have chosen a different fixation approach to construct a subtrochanteric fracture model in rabbits for future investigations of bone healing mechanisms at deeper fracture sites and also for those resulting in nonunion and delayed unions. Moreover, the reproducibility of the animal model is associated with the degree of consistency. Therefore, an effective animal model is necessary to study the diaphyseal fracture healing mechanism and for clinical treatment as well. Rabbits are one of the most commonly used animals in orthopedic research. The mid&#8208;diaphyseal bone region of rabbits and humans is reported to be similar in fracture toughness and bone mineral density [<xref rid="os70137-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="os70137-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The configuration and blood supply are also found to be similar; thus, they are used in hip fracture animal model studies [<xref rid="os70137-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Open osteotomy is considered an excellent model to study the fracture healing mechanisms of non&#8208;unions, and the fracture location can be standardized with this method [<xref rid="os70137-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The purpose of this study was to develop a simple, reproducible, and cost&#8208;effective model for rabbit femur bone fracture healing using open osteotomy. We have described the following through this study:<list list-type="roman-lower" id="os70137-list-0001"><list-item id="os70137-li-0001"><p>We have created a fresh fracture at the subtrochanteric region of the rabbit femur bone through open osteotomy followed by internal fixation using a customized 3D printed titanium compression plate.</p></list-item><list-item id="os70137-li-0002"><p>The fracture healing was evaluated using the outcome measures such as radiography, MicroCT, and histomorphometry after 42&#8201;days of fracture.</p></list-item><list-item id="os70137-li-0003"><p>Through this study, we have followed a different approach to construct this fracture model and we have achieved a success rate of 87.5% with no side effects to the animals' post&#8208;surgery.</p></list-item></list>

This technology further allows the design of appropriate fixators for all kinds of bone defect management. In this study, the femur bone from an adult New Zealand white rabbit carcass was harvested and the tissues on the bone surface were removed as shown in Figure&#160;<xref rid="os70137-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>. The bone sample was then mounted using a holder inside the MicroCT scanner and prepared for scanning. The optimal resolution for the scanning was set to 2.5&#8201;&#956;m. Once the parameter was set, the scanning was done automatically by the machine. The 3D image of the scanned bone was generated by the built&#8208;in image reconstruction software of the MicroCT scanner. The reconstructed data was extracted in STL format, and the 3D model of the bone was created with a 3D printer machine at U3DP, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="os70137-fig-0001" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Customization of 3D printed titanium compression plate.

The customized compression plate consisted of five locking screws with a diameter of 1.5&#8201;mm for each screw hole and the thickness of the plate was 1.2&#8201;mm. The weight of each bone plate was 1&#8201;g. The fixation screws were purchased from a standard company (BIORTHO CO LTD, Jiangsu, China) producing &#8216;A&#8208;grade&#8217; veterinary screws specifically for animal surgeries. The outer diameter of these screws was 2&#8201;mm, and the length of the screw was 12&#8201;mm. All the bone plates and the screws were disinfected ultrasonically in absolute acetone followed by ethanol as a final process.</p></sec><sec id="os70137-sec-0008"><label>2.2</label><title>Experimental Animals</title><p>All the experimental procedures were conducted after obtaining approval from the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Ref no. 20&#8208;051&#8208;MIS) and the license issued by the Department of Health of the Hong Kong Government.

Under general anesthesia, an intramuscular injection was given by a mixture of ketamine (50&#8201;mg/kg) and xylazine (10&#8201;mg/kg). The anesthetic condition of the rabbit was confirmed by the rabbit's eye&#8208;lip reflex motion along with a relaxed breathing pattern. All the surgical instruments, implants, and screws underwent autoclave before use. The surgical site was shaved carefully and followed by disinfection of the site using 70% ethanol and prepared for the surgical procedure (Figure&#160;<xref rid="os70137-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The rabbit was then draped in a sterile cloth leaving the surgical site exposed. To create an open osteotomy fracture in rabbits, a skin incision was given by a scalpel blade (surgical blade, size 23). Following the incision, the muscles (biceps femoris muscle and semimembranosus muscle) were retracted (Figure&#160;<xref rid="os70137-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>) to find the subtrochanteric region of the femoral bone. An air&#8208;powered sagittal oscillating saw (Model no.: 05.001.082, Air pen drive, DePuy Synthes, Germany) with a 1&#8201;mm blade thickness was used to create the open osteotomy at the subtrochanteric region. Five holes were created (Figure&#160;<xref rid="os70137-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) with a drilling bit of diameter 1.5&#8201;mm, and a thread length of 12&#8201;mm was created for screw fixation. After the creation of drill holes, the 3D printed titanium implant was internally fixed using five self&#8208;tapping cortical screws (Figure&#160;<xref rid="os70137-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>) of diameter 2&#8201;mm. The gap of the osteotomy site was 1&#8201;mm. A simple transverse subtrochanteric fracture with no comminution was first verified by direct visualization (Figure&#160;<xref rid="os70137-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). The surgical site was cleaned using sterile saline. Finally, the connective tissue layers were closed with non&#8208;absorbable 8&#8211;0 nylon sutures, and the skin was closed with 4&#8211;0 nylon sutures (MERSILK, W580, ETHICON, USA). The overall surgical procedure took 20&#8201;min per rabbit. A post&#8208;operative radiograph was taken immediately after the suturing to confirm the successful fracture and implant fixation (Figure&#160;<xref rid="os70137-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). Post&#8208;surgery, an intramuscular injection of 0.1&#8201;mL of buprenorphine (analgesia) was administered twice a day up to three consecutive days. The animals were given post&#8208;surgical care for their speedy recovery. After the surgery, the animals were allowed to move freely inside the cage. From the second day after the surgery, the animals were found active inside the cage. The physiological condition of the rabbits was monitored regularly to ensure the occurrence of any post&#8208;surgical complications.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="os70137-fig-0002" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Creation of subtrochanteric fracture.

The regular radiographs taken post fracture have shown continuous successful progression of bone union. The findings of MicroCT images revealed the increased volume of callus formation at the fractured side. Further, the histology staining results also demonstrated the remodeling of bone by the presence of a significant number of mature bone cells (osteocytes) at the osteotomy site.

<styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">3D</styled-content> Printed Implants for Animal Models</title><p>Osteotomy models are often used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the fixators used. The fracture healing process during osteotomies would purely depend upon the stability of the fixations [<xref rid="os70137-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the present study, we have customized a locking plate based on the anatomy of the rabbit femur bone by 3D printing technology. The development of 3D printing technology over the years possesses potential benefits in many biomedical applications due to its mass production and customized fabrication [<xref rid="os70137-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The implants can be pre&#8208;contoured based on the 3D model of the bone, which reduces the complications related to implants. This further helps to improve surgical efficiency and accuracy. The current study revealed a success rate of 87.5% using 3D printed implants. We have fabricated the implants using titanium metal. Compared to stainless steel, titanium has greater fatigue resistance and maximum torque [<xref rid="os70137-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="os70137-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The corrosion properties of the titanium implants are lower, which protects the inside of the body and are good at reducing the toxicity caused by metal debris. Although we have not evaluated the mechanical properties of the implants, none of the rabbits faced delayed or nonunions throughout the observational period.</p></sec><sec id="os70137-sec-0025"><label>4.3</label><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>Our fracture model mimics real fractures mechanically and biologically. The fracture pattern that we have created includes transverse or oblique fracture patterns that commonly occur in humans. Thus, it helps in the assessment of the fracture healing process in real conditions. The radiographic evaluation also found to be similar to that of humans, that is, from the inflammatory phase to the remodeling phase. The implant material used in this study is the same as that in humans which is commonly used, which further enhances mechanical stability and greater flexibility, thus promoting better callus formation. Finally, the time required for fracture healing parallels the stages observed in humans. Altogether, this fracture model provides a great platform for investigating various biophysical interventions and their cellular mechanisms by resembling the real&#8208;time fracture scenarios. While this study has successfully provided a novel fracture model to explore the underlying future studies on mechanisms in hip bone fracture healing and their biophysical interventions, there are still some limitations. One limitation of this study is that the fracture healing was not characterized at weekly intervals to understand the bone formation process at each phase of healing at the subtrochanteric region. As the model we have newly established falls into the classification of open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) at a diaphyseal region of a long bone, the healing of bones would follow a typical secondary healing through the process of endochondral ossification. In other words, the evolution of the callus size would be a very good indication of the stage at which the bone has progressed in the healing process [<xref rid="os70137-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="os70137-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="os70137-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Hence, we have only taken weekly radiographs to monitor the fracture healing progression and implant fixation. Another limitation is that we have not conducted mechanical testing for the unfractured side, leading to the difficulty in assessing the bone strength of the fractured side. In future studies, the bone healing process at different stages can be investigated to understand the fracture healing mechanisms at the inflammatory/hematoma stage and the remodeling stage, and more tests can be conducted to understand more of the healed bone quality.</p></sec><sec id="os70137-sec-0026"><label>4.4</label><title>Prospects of Clinical Application</title><p>This animal model provides platforms for testing new fixation methods and biophysical interventions that allow research to validate their findings before translation to clinical practices. Further, this model helps in understanding the biomechanical properties of femur bone fracture healing by considering the load&#8208;bearing capacity of the bone. Biological evaluation helps to study the fracture healing mechanism at this region and thereby enhances treatment strategies. We have not encountered any significant problems while creating this fracture model. In the current study, we have used only a reliable sample size. As the study has great clinical significance, a larger sample size should be used in future studies to validate the efficacy of creating this model. As we have used small animal models, the fracture healing mechanism should be tested in larger animal models before translating to humans. The findings from this study can be used in exploring the biophysical interventions at the subtrochanteric region.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="os70137-sec-0027"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have successfully developed a novel pre&#8208;clinical animal model in rabbits for the first time for subtrochanteric fracture healing studies. It is technically a simple model and easily reproducible, thus it can be widely adopted. As closed fracture models are difficult to create at this location and the fracture site cannot be standardized due to the occurrence of comminuted fractures, we have opted for open osteotomy. The fractured bone healed and remodeled within a period of 42&#8201;days. This model could be used in future studies to investigate the fracture healing mechanisms at deeper sites, nonunion, and delayed unions, as well as different biophysical stimulation methods.</p></sec><sec id="os70137-sec-0028"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Study design (PP, SKHC, LWHC, LQ, YPZ), data collection (PP, SKHC, SL, MMCL), data analysis (PP, SKHC), writing (PP, SKHC, SL, MMCL, LWHC, LQ, YPZ), supervision (LWHC, LQ, YPZ).
