The delivery of drugs to the brain is further complicated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To address this, we developed EGFR single-chain fragment variable (scFv)-modified macrophage membrane liposomes (scFv-MML) encapsulating LPCAT1 siRNA (scFv-MML@LPCAT1si) as a targeted therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) BM.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">EGFR scFv-pcDNA3.1(-) plasmids were transfected into RAW 264.7 cells to generate RAW 264.7-scFv cells. Macrophage membranes were isolated from these cells and used to coat liposomes (Lip) encapsulating LPCAT1 siRNA via extrusion. The cellular uptake, LPCAT1 silencing, and anti-tumor efficacy of scFv-MML@LPCAT1si were evaluated in vitro using PC9 lung cancer cells. In vivo studies were performed in a mouse model of NSCLC BM to assess tumor targeting, accumulation, and therapeutic effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In vitro, scFv-MML@LPCAT1si exhibited superior cellular uptake and silencing of LPCAT1 expression in EGFR-positive PC9 cells compared to control liposomes, leading to increased cell apoptosis and decreased proliferation. In vivo, scFv-MML@LPCAT1si showed improved tumor targeting and accumulation in the brain, effectively slowing tumor growth and reducing body weight loss in mice with NSCLC BM. The biodistribution study revealed sustained tumor fluorescence intensity for more than 24&#160;h after injection, with significant retention of siRNA within the tumor site. No significant systemic toxicity or organ damage was observed in mice treated with scFv-MML@LPCAT1si.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Our findings suggest that scFv-MML@LPCAT1si represents a promising targeted therapy for NSCLC BM, leveraging the unique properties of scFv-MML to traverse the BBB and deliver therapeutic payloads to tumor sites with high accuracy and efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12896-025-01000-5.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Macrophage-membrane-coated liposomes</kwd><kwd>Blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>Drug delivery</kwd><kwd>Lung cancer</kwd><kwd>Brain metastasis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Zhongda Hospital-Lianyungang First People's Hospital Joint fund project</institution></funding-source><award-id>zdlyg25</award-id><award-id>zdlyg25</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Yuan</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>JiaXin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Nanjing health science and technology development special fund project of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>YKK23272</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yijing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province (No. 2025SF-YBXM-370)</institution></funding-source><award-id>Jun Jiang</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">In China, lung cancer ranks as the most widespread solid tumor and the top cause of cancer-related deaths. There are approximately 1,000,000 new cases registered and up to 700,000 lung-cancer related deaths occur per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Due to its extensive vascularization, the brain often undergoes metastatic events, which occur in 18&#8211;61% of lung cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although certain lung cancer patients exhibit favorable responses to combined treatments, including cranial radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and anti-angiogenic therapy, the prognosis for those with brain metastases remains unfavorable. The two-year overall survival (OS) rate for patients who underwent the aforementioned treatment combination was only 38.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Meanwhile, some adverse events (AEs) may arise from this treatment combination, leading to the dose reduction, treatment discontinuation, or even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Developing new strategies for clinical practice might give a chance to improve clinical outcomes of BM patients.</p><p id="Par6">Cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (CNPs) represent a promising new class of nanocarriers. These particles are crafted by wrapping synthetic cores in natural cell membranes, creating a core-shell structure that mimics cells. This biomimetic approach facilitates effective bio-interfacing and navigation through complex biological environments, evading immune clearance while precisely targeting disease sites, thereby rendering it an ideal tool for drug delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Previous research indicates that macrophages can target glioblastoma (GBM), suggesting that coating NPs with macrophage membranes facilitates their passage across the BBB for drug delivery to tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, the delivery of CNPs for tumor treatment lacks sufficient accuracy and efficiency. Tumor-specific ligands, such as antibodies and peptides, can functionalize CNPs by introducing cell-targeting capabilities. In a glioblastoma mouse model, blood-brain barrier-penetrating peptide-modified macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticles (MNPs) effectively evaded the immune system, significantly inhibiting tumor progression and enhancing radiosensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In earlier research, we created a single-chain fragment variable (scFv) targeting EGFR that transported siRNA to EGFR-positive tumor models, overcoming resistance to EGFR-TKI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Building on this, we synthesized targeting NPs utilizing the scFv and confirmed their effectiveness as an MRI contrast agent in living organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We showed that EGFR-specific scFv-anchored exosomes can deliver siRNA through the BBB to the BM, demonstrating strong anticancer effects with minimal toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In the present study, EGFR specific scFv modified macrophage membrane coated liposomes (scFv-MML) were developed for the delivery of LPCAT1 siRNA (scFv-MML@LPCAT1si), and their potential for the treatment of NSCLC BM was studied in a mouse model. The results demonstrated that scFv-MML@LPCAT1si exhibited superior anti-tumor activities against NSCLC BM, likely attributed to the combined effects of siRNA-mediated gene silencing and antibody-induced neutralization of EGFR in the targeted tumor cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Establishment of RAW 264.7-scFv</title><p id="Par8">RAW 264.7 were purchased from the cell bank of Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (SIBCB). RAW 264.7-scFv cells were genetically engineered by transducing RAW 264.7 cells with EGFR-specific scFv-pcDNA3.1(-) plasmids. The plasmids were produced as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. RAW 264.7-control cells were constructed by transducing plasmids containing the sequence of hinge and transmembrane. RAW 264.7 cells (Shanghai Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank) were maintained in complete Dulbecco&#8217;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco BRL, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biological Industries, Israel). Cells were incubated at 37&#160;&#176;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> environment. RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10^5 cells per well 24&#160;h prior to transfection and were subsequently transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The culture medium was refreshed six hours later, and incubation continued for 48&#160;h. Subsequently, genetically engineered RAW 264.7-scFv cells were purified using G418 at an initial concentration of 400&#160;&#181;g/ml (MP bio, 400) and then reseeded for further expansion. PC9 cells with stable luciferase expression were developed using the luciferase encoding pLenti 6.3 lentiviral vector, following previously described methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec344"><title>Isolation of macrophage membrane</title><p id="Par9">The macrophage membranes were extracted from RAW 264.7-control cells and RAW 264.7-scFv cells, following a previously established protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Cells were collected and resuspended in ice-cold Tris-magnesium buffer (TM buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.01&#160;M Tris and 0.001&#160;M MgCl<sub>2</sub>) to a density of 2.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10^7 cells/ml. Subsequently, they were processed 20 times using an Avanti mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, USA) to ensure cell disruption. The cell homogenate was mixed with 1&#160;M sucrose to achieve a final concentration of 0.25&#160;M and centrifuged at 2000&#215;g for 10&#160;min at 4&#160;&#176;C. The clear supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 3000&#215;g for 30&#160;min at 4&#160;&#176;C to isolate the cell membranes. The membranes were rinsed with ice-cold TM buffer containing 0.25&#160;M sucrose and collected by centrifugation at 3000&#215;g for 30&#160;min at 4&#160;&#176;C. To quantify the protein content in the purified macrophage membranes, a BCA protein assay (Solarbio, China) was conducted, facilitating further preparation of MML. Western blot analysis using a 1:5000 diluted anti-His.tag antibody (Abmart, China) confirmed the presence of scFv in the membrane extracts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2223"><title>Preparation of MML</title><p id="Par10">MML was fabricated by coating liposomes with a macrophage membrane using a direct extrusion method. Initially, liposomes were prepared via the thin film hydration technique. DOTAP, DOPE, cholesterol, and DSPE-PEG2000 were dissolved in chloroform using ultrasonic bath sonication and evaporated under reduced pressure for 2&#160;h to create a thin film, with a weight ratio of 3:5:1.5:0.5. Subsequently, siRNA was dissolved in nuclease-free water and mixed with DSPE-PEG2000 in sodium acetate/ethanol solution (v/v&#8201;=&#8201;9:1). Lipids and siRNA were gradually combined and dialyzed in PBS for 2&#160;h at ambient temperature. Next, the purified scFv-decorated macrophage membrane, obtained from 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10^8 cells, was mixed with 2&#160;ml of siRNA-loaded liposomes containing 200 nM siRNA. The mixture was extruded sequentially through polycarbonate membranes with 400&#160;nm and 200&#160;nm pore sizes to prepare the MML. The successful decoration of the macrophage membrane was verified by measuring the particle size and zeta potential of the MML using a NanoBrook 90 plus PALS nanoparticle size potentiometer (Brookhaven, USA). Additionally, the morphology of the MML was observed under a transmission electron microscope (Tecnai F20, FEI, USA). The drug loading efficiency (LE) and the encapsulation efficiency (EE) were determined using a UV spectrophotometer (TU&#8722;1810, PERSEE, China). Bare liposomes (Lip) that did not fused with membrane were used as control.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1666"><title>Cellular uptake of siRNA</title><p id="Par11">PC9 cells, also obtained from the cell bank of SIBCB, were seeded in confocal dishes to assess the in vitro uptake of siRNA. Lip@LPCATsi, MML@LPCATsi, and scFv-MML@LPCAT1si, each containing 100 nM FAM-labeled siRNA, were added to the wells and incubated for either 1&#8211;6&#160;h. Subsequently, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15&#160;min, followed by staining of nuclei with 1.5&#160;&#181;g/ml DAPI at room temperature for 5&#160;min. After PBS washing, siRNA cellular uptake was observed via a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="Sec1566"><title>LPCAT1 silencing on uptake of MML in vitro</title><p id="Par12">PC9 cells were cultured in 6-well plates at 5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10^4 cells per well and incubated for 18&#160;h at 37&#160;&#176;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cells were exposed to Lip@LPCAT1si, MML@LPCAT1si, or scFv-MML@LPCAT1si for 3&#160;h, followed by a medium change to fresh culture medium. The cells were washed three times with PBS after the medium was removed at the 48-hour mark. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis were employed to evaluate the expression level of LPCAT1. For qRT-PCR, total RNA was extracted from cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA). The PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) was utilized for cDNA synthesis. LPCAT1 expression was quantified via qPCR using the Bio-Rad CFX Manager 3.1 software. The &#916;&#916;CT values representing the expression of the target gene, normalized to the internal reference gene actin, were utilized to generate the correlation data. For western blot analysis, total protein was extracted from isolated membranes or cells by RIPA Lysis Buffer (Solarbio, Beijing, China) at 4&#160;&#176;C for a duration of 15&#160;min. Protein levels were determined using a BCA protein assay kit. Approximately 30&#160;&#181;g protein samples were resolved through 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and subsequently moved onto NC membranes (Millipore, Shanghai, China). After blocking with 3% BSA, membranes were incubated overnight at 4&#160;&#176;C with anti-LPCAT1 (1:2000, Proteintech, Wuhan, China) and anti-&#946;-actin (1:4000, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Subsequently, samples were incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10000, CST, MA, USA) and visualized using ECL reagents. The Tanon 5500 imaging system was used to visualize and document the bands.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15626"><title>Cell apoptosis and proliferation assay</title><p id="Par13">Cell proliferation was assessed by analyzing Ki&#8722;67 expression using an APC anti-human Ki&#8722;67 antibody (Biolegend, USA) through flow cytometry (FCM) on a CytoFLEX instrument (Beckman Coulter, USA).

The mice were put under anesthesia and secured in a stereotactic frame (RWD, Shenzhen, China). After drilling a tiny perforation 1&#160;mm forward and 2&#160;mm outward from the brain&#8217;s bregma, we injected PC9 cells into the right cerebral hemisphere using a 10&#160;&#181;l Hamilton syringe equipped with a 30-gauge needle, reaching a depth of 3&#160;mm from the brain&#8217;s surface. The needle was injected at a consistent pace for 2&#160;min, followed by a 2-minute pause, after which it was withdrawn and the scalp was sutured. A week following the injection, a 150&#160;mg/kg dose of D-luciferin was given intraperitoneally to reveal the tumors in the brains of the mice.

Meanwhile, around 40&#8211;50% of NSCLC patients develop BM during the course of their illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The onset of BM is correlated with a reduced quality of life for NSCLC patients due to complications in the central nervous system (CNS) and a poor prognosis, with a median OS of merely 7 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The presence of the BBB poses significant challenges in developing effective therapeutics for CNS diseases, particularly in managing NSCLC brain metastases (BM), which typically require a multimodal approach combining systemic therapies-including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immune checkpoint blockade therapies, and anti-angiogenic agents-with local interventions such as surgery and radiation therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These strategies, whether used individually or in combination, while offering excellent local control and significantly improving NSCLC prognosis in many cases, still face persistent challenges such as new BM development post-treatment, often due to emerging drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">There is an urgent need for advanced technologies to deliver pharmaceuticals to the tumor site within the CNS. In response, numerous brain delivery technologies have been developed and rigorously evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. CNPs, with their inherent plasticity that enhances solubility and stability in blood circulation, serve as ideal carriers for CNS drug delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For example, the modification of nanoparticles with PD&#8722;1-upregulated macrophage membrance facilitated their penetration of the BBB and elicited potent immune response by enhancing CD8&#8201;<sup>+</sup>&#8201;cytotoxic T-lymphocyte infiltration in the tumor microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In another previous study, MNPs successfully crossed the BBB and exerted an attenuating effect on oxidative stress at the site of neuropathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Biomimetic neutrophil and macrophage hybrid CNPs could also guide targeted drug delivery and promotes therapeutic efficacy against glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In this study, we equipped the MNPs with an EGFR-specific scFv, whose activity in guiding effectors across the BBB has been demonstrated in our previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In vitro, scFv-MML@LPCAT1si entered PC9 cells more rapidly than both Lip@LPCAT1si and MML@LPCAT1si, suggesting that the anti-EGFR scFv anchored on the macrophage membrane enhanced the recognition of antigens on lung cancer cells, thereby swiftly guide MNPs to the receiving cells, and accelerating their internalization. In vivo, scFv-MML@LPCAT1si enhanced drug enrichment in metastatic tumor cells after crossing the BBB, and minimized non-selective distribution in healthy brain tissues.</p><p id="Par33">Repeated administration of NPs elicits an immune response, often leading to rapid clearance by the body. Additionally, there are potential toxicity risks associated with some NPs, as they have been proved to induce oxidative stress and inflammatory responses upon entering the blood circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This, in turn, can lead to cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, allergic reactions, and ultimately, result in organelle damage or even the onset of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Cell membrane coating presents a promising approach to mitigating material toxicity. By integrating with the cell membrane, NPs achieve enhanced biocompatibility and circumvent direct exposure to the internal environment, thereby exhibiting great potential for safe and effective therapeutic applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. MNPs adopt the natural attributes of macrophages, encompassing non-immunogenicity, specificity for targeting tumor cells, affinity for localizing to inflammatory sites, and adherence to pathogens. MNPs loaded with specific siRNAs extend in vivo circulation time, enhanced fusion with tumor cells, and elicit potent gene silencing and immunotherapeutic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The present study revealed the outstanding biocompatibility of the functionalized platform, as indicated by no observable damage or lesions in the major organs of mice and no significant systemic toxicity across all groups, thus opening up the possibility of potential biomedical applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec122255"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par34">To sum up, the high incidence of BM in patients with stage IV NSCLC underscores the urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies. The management of NSCLC BM remains challenging, with current treatment modalities offering varying degrees of success but often complicated by the existence of the BBB. Advanced technologies for delivering biopharmaceuticals to the CNS are crucial, and CNPs, particularly MNPs show great promise. Cell membrane coating mitigates the potential toxicity associated with some nanoparticles, improving biocompatibility and safety. This study introduces a new method for delivering anti-tumor siRNA using MNPs functionalized with an EGFR-specific scFv. Significant tumor growth retardation was observed in the NSCLC BM mouse model.
