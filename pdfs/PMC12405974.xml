DCs engulf extracellular DNA released by dying cancer cells, supporting activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and concomitant DC maturation. Extracellular DNA in the tumor microenvironment is primarily derived from cells undergoing uncontrolled necrosis or programmed inflammatory death, such as necroptosis, which can be induced when apoptosis pathways are inhibited. Here, we report that caspase inhibition primes activation of a RIPK1/3, MLKL, and STING signaling axis in DCs, resulting in maturation without the need for any further maturation stimuli such as LPS or TNF&#8208;&#945;. Notably, these signaling events do not induce DC death, indicating a nonnecroptotic role of the RIPK1&#8208;RIPK3&#8208;MLKL pathway and novel crosstalk with the STING pathway. Caspase inhibition in DC/cancer cell co&#8208;cultures results in DC maturation, inducing TNF&#8208;&#945; secretion, which delivers the co&#8208;signal to induce cancer cell necroptosis. In summary, we find a collaborative mechanism of the STING and necroptosis pathway in DC maturation, and that activation of the necroptosis pathway has opposite effects on cancer cells and DCs, proposing a possibility for new targets in cancer immunotherapy.</p></abstract><abstract id="eji70044-abs-0001" abstract-type="graphical"><p>In this study, we show that caspase&#8208;8 inhibition induce maturation in DCs through a synergistic crosstalk between the STING signaling pathway and RIPK1&#8208;RIPK3&#8208;MLKL pathway, without induction of cell death in the DCs.

Cancer cells can also die through various forms of regulated cell death, notably apoptosis or programmed immunogenic cell death (ICD), such as necroptosis and pyroptosis [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Whereas apoptosis usually is immunologically silent, ICD leads to the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) and nuclear proteins, leading to inflammation and ultimately to an adaptive response against tumor&#8208;associated and tumor&#8208;specific antigens [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Engagement of death receptors supports the initiation of apoptosis through activation of caspase&#8208;8. If caspase&#8208;8 is inhibited, receptor&#8208;interacting serine/threonine protein kinase (RIPK)&#8208;1 will recruit and phosphorylate RIPK3, which then binds and phosphorylates mixed&#8208;lineage kinase domain&#8208;like protein (MLKL) [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. MLKL is the executor of necroptosis, and when phosphorylated by RIPK3, it undergoes conformational change, resulting in oligomerization and translocation to the plasma membrane. Subsequently, this will induce pore formation and leakage of intracellular DAMPs, such as dsDNA, to the surroundings [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The RIPK1&#8208;RIPK3&#8208;MLKL pathway has mainly been investigated as a backup cell death mechanism to counteract viral infections that block apoptosis. However, increasing evidence shows that proteins involved in necroptosis signaling have functions beyond induction of necroptosis, and there is a link between proteins from the necroptosis pathway and the type I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) response, where RIPK1 and RIPK3 positively regulate the IFN&#8208;I response to LPS in macrophages [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, IFN&#8208;I has been shown to be required for sufficient RIPK3 activation for necroptosis execution [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and MLKL is an interferon&#8208;stimulated gene (ISG); thus, its expression will depend on IFN&#8208;I [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Besides preventing necroptosis, caspase&#8208;8 can cleave RIPK1 and appear to influence stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and TANK&#8208;binding kinase 1 (TBK1) activity, which is constitutively active in caspase&#8208;8 KO mice [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Cancer cells dying through ICD may leak DNA into the tumor microenvironment (TME), which can activate nearby immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), through the detection by DNA recognition receptors, especially cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS) [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Binding of DNA to cGAS leads to a conformational change, enabling it to catalyze the formation of the second messenger, cyclic 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP), from GTP and ATP [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. cGAMP is a cyclic di&#8208;nucleotide that binds and activates STING in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Upon binding of cGAMP, STING translocates to the ER&#8208;Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGIC) and activates TBK1, leading to TBK1 auto&#8208;phosphorylation and phosphorylation of STING and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). The phosphorylated, dimerized IRF3 translocates to the nucleus where it induces transcription of IFN&#8208;I, and subsequently, ISGs [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Cancer cells may also produce cGAMP as a response to DNA that may build up in the cytosol due to chromosomal instability [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly, cGAMP released from irradiated tumors has been shown to be essential for activation of tumor&#8208;infiltrating DCs, and the success of an antitumor immune response is dependent on activation of DCs and their ability to induce a strong IFN&#8208;I response as well as activation of cytotoxic T cells [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Thus, it is clear that the necroptosis pathway and STING pathway interact; however, the relationship between these two pathways is still largely unresolved and has so far not been investigated in DCs.</p><p>Here we show that DCs can undergo maturation if caspases are inhibited, without the need for other maturation stimuli. We show that the maturation results from activation through a mechanism that requires the activity of STING as well as the RIPK1&#8208;RIPK3&#8208;MLKL signaling pathway through a necroptosis&#8208;independent function of MLKL. We further show that inhibition of caspases in DC/cancer cell co&#8208;cultures leads to DC maturation and drives cancer cell death, caused by the combination of caspase inhibition in the cancer cells and TNF&#8208;&#945; released from the activated DCs.</p></sec><sec id="eji70044-sec-0020"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="eji70044-sec-0030"><label>2.1</label><title>Caspase Inhibition Drives Dendritic Cell Maturation</title><p>To investigate if caspase inhibition in dendritic cells influences their activation, we treated murine bone marrow&#8208;derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) with increasing amounts of zVAD&#8208;fmk (zVAD) and analyzed the expression of maturation markers MHC&#8208;II, CD86, and CD40 (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1A&#8211;C</xref>). The expression of all maturation markers was seen to increase in a dose&#8208;dependent manner (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>), and we observed high viability in all tested concentrations, although with a slight decrease in cultures receiving the highest concentration (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). This was most likely caused by the high dosage of DMSO solvent used for zVAD dissolution (Figure <xref rid="eji70044-supinfo-0001" ref-type="">1A</xref>), as maturation of the DCs was not induced when treating with DMSO alone (Figure <xref rid="eji70044-supinfo-0001" ref-type="">S1B</xref>). To rule out that cell death during differentiation led to increased maturation, we treated BMDCs with zVAD at days 8, 9, and 10 during differentiation. Treatment led to upregulated maturation markers in an equal amount at all three time points, which was similar to the maturation caused by LPS, independent of the number of dead cells in the culture (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1E,F</xref>). Furthermore, DNase I treatment did not inhibit the maturation in BMDCs, indicating that the maturation is independent of DNA released from dying cells (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">S1C</xref>). The same degree of DC maturation in response to zVAD could be confirmed in human monocyte&#8208;derived dendritic cells (moDCs) (Figure <xref rid="eji70044-supinfo-0001" ref-type="">S1D</xref>).

BMDCs treated with zVAD alone did not have any observable phosphorylation of either STING or TBK1, whereas cGAMP stimulation, as expected, led to both STING and TBK1 phosphorylation, which declined after 8&#160;h (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Remarkably, when combining zVAD and cGAMP, both STING and TBK1 phosphorylation were sustained at a high level, even after 24&#160;h (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Overall, these findings indicate that maturation induced by zVAD is dependent on STING. It only minimally impacts STING activity itself but amplifies cGAMP&#8208;mediated STING activation. To determine if the observed effects of zVAD treatment were due to caspase&#8208;8 activity, we treated BMDCs with the specific caspase&#8208;8 inhibitor II and compared this with zVAD treatment. BMDCs treated with caspase&#8208;8 inhibitor showed maturation similar to the observations with zVAD, supporting that the mode&#8208;of&#8208;action is caspase&#8208;8 driven (Figure <xref rid="eji70044-supinfo-0001" ref-type="">S2A</xref>). Like zVAD, the caspase&#8208;8 inhibitor did not influence viability (Figure <xref rid="eji70044-supinfo-0001" ref-type="">S2B</xref>). If zVAD could influence the sensitivity of STING to cGAMP treatment, we should see an increase in DC maturation in co&#8208;treated cells. Indeed, BMDCs showed an increase in maturation marker expression when treated with zVAD + cGAMP relative to mono&#8208;treatment with either one alone (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, we did not observe degradation of total STING following its activation, which has previously been described in different cell lines, including moDCs [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To rule out that this did not result from erroneous antibody staining caused by the anti&#8208;STING antibody used, we stripped and re&#8208;probed the same membranes with another anti&#8208;STING antibody, which led to the same result (Figure <xref rid="eji70044-supinfo-0001" ref-type="">S3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="eji70044-sec-0050"><label>2.3</label><title>zVAD&#8208;Induced Maturation Is Dependent on RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL Activity, Which Do Not Influence Viability</title><p>It has previously been shown that RIPK1 can interact with the STING pathway in macrophages [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We set out to investigate whether the zVAD&#8208;induced DC maturation was dependent on RIPK1. BMDCs were pretreated with the RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin&#8208;1 (nec&#8208;1) for 1&#160;h, followed by treatment with zVAD for an additional 24&#160;h and subsequent measurement of maturation marker expression. Nec&#8208;1 treatment resulted in decreased expression of all maturation markers, indicating that RIPK1 activity was needed for zVAD&#8208;induced maturation (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). The same dependency could also be found in moDCs (Figure <xref rid="eji70044-supinfo-0001" ref-type="">S4</xref>). Since RIPK1 activity is regulated by phosphorylation, we performed RIPK1&#8208;phosphorylation WB on lysates from zVAD&#8208;treated BMDCs at various timepoints. RIPK1 was phosphorylated after 4&#160;h of zVAD stimulation, thus confirming an involvement of RIPK1 in the observed DC maturation (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). If RIPK1 is activated, caspase inhibition should lead to RIPK1&#8208;mediated phosphorylation of RIPK3 [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To assess if this was also the case in the DCs, we measured RIPK3 phosphorylation and likewise found RIPK3 phosphorylation starting 4&#160;h poststimulation (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="eji70044-fig-0003" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>zVAD&#8208;induced DC maturation is dependent on RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL.

MLKL was phosphorylated 4&#160;h poststimulation with zVAD and zVAD + cGAMP, similarly to RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>; Figure <xref rid="eji70044-supinfo-0001" ref-type="">S3B</xref>). MLKL phosphorylation typically leads to induction of necroptosis, but surprisingly, the DCs did not die, despite this activation, indicating an alternative function of MLKL.</p><p>Since we saw STING activation concomitantly with MLKL phosphorylation, following the same pattern as constitutive activation in co&#8208;treated samples, we investigated whether STING activity was maintained in the absence of the active necroptosis pathway. Phosphorylations of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL can be blocked using the inhibitor GW806742X. BMDCs were treated with zVAD with or without GW806742X for 8&#160;h. Indeed, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL phosphorylations were abrogated in DCs treated with zVAD in the presence of GW806742X, confirming that this inhibitor can be used to block the endpoint of the necroptosis signaling pathway (Figure <xref rid="eji70044-supinfo-0001" ref-type="">S3C</xref>). We observed minimal STING phosphorylation in the zVAD&#8208;treated cells (only visible upon long exposure of the membrane), and phosphorylation was inhibited by GW806742X (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). We observed TBK1 phosphorylation in DCs treated with zVAD alone, and this was also abrogated, indicating a link between necroptosis signaling and STING and TBK1 phosphorylation (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). To assess if GW806742X also influenced DC maturation after zVAD treatment, we investigated maturation marker expression on zVAD&#8208;treated BMDCs and found that the zVAD&#8208;induced maturation was indeed inhibited (Figure&#160;<xref rid="eji70044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>).

Cell death of L929 cells was analyzed by comparing the ratio of L929 cells and BMDCs of the mixed culture with or without zVAD stimulation, since dead L929 cells were completely disintegrated and likely rapidly phagocytized by the DCs.

Here we report that inhibiting caspases is sufficient to drive DC maturation through RIPK1&#8208;RIPK3&#8208;MLKL activation without induction of cell death. We further show that the effect happens through a STING&#8208;dependent mechanism, thus coupling necroptosis signaling with STING in DCs.</p><p>Both STING signaling and cell death are influenced by the activity of caspases. Caspase&#8208;1 has been found to cleave cGAS, thereby reducing IFN&#8208;I synthesis [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, caspase&#8208;3 has been found to reduce the effect of radiotherapy on cancer cells by abrogating the IFN&#8208;I synthesis, making caspase inhibition a possible co&#8208;treatment during radiotherapy [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Caspase&#8208;8 is constitutively active at a low level in DCs [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and blocking this leads to RIPK1 activity in immature DCs [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Upon caspase inhibition, RIPK1 has been shown to function as a &#8220;docking scaffold&#8221; for TBK1, leading to elevated IFN&#8208;I production after STING activation [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Other studies have investigated the interplay between these pathways in macrophages [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Saleh et&#160;al. [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] studied caspase inhibition in macrophages and found that zVAD treatment increased the sensitivity to LPS&#8208;induced IFN&#8208;I synthesis, dependent on STING, RIPK1, and RIPK3 activity. In accordance with this, we find that THP&#8208;1&#8208;derived macrophages increase cGAMP&#8208;induced IFN&#8208;I secretion when caspases are inhibited. In contrast to the findings in macrophages, which required a co&#8208;stimulus, we find that caspase inhibition on its own can drive BMDC and moDC maturation through a mechanism dependent on STING. Similarly, to the findings in macrophages, we find that zVAD&#8208;induced DC maturation required RIPK1 and RIPK3 activity. Surprisingly, we find that DC maturation concomitantly had MLKL activation, which is contradictory to the findings in macrophages, where IFN&#8208;I signaling is independent of MLKL activity [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The exact role of MLKL is still somewhat uncertain, since the use of the MLKL&#8208;inhibitor, GW806742X, also inhibits RIPK1 kinase activity. Despite activation of the full RIPK1&#8208;RIPK3&#8208;MLKL pathway, we see no increase in cell death in the DCs. This indicates a unique phenotype imposed in DCs upon necroptotic pathway activation, making DCs able to mature and induce a potent immune response without dying themselves.</p><p>We observe a high level of STING phosphorylation with concomitant increase in TBK1 phosphorylation when the DCs are co&#8208;treated with zVAD and cGAMP. Likewise, DC maturation was increased in the combinational treatment compared with mono&#8208;treatments. Interestingly, activation of the STING pathway seen by phosphorylation, is sustained at a high level, still present 24&#160;h after stimulation upon co&#8208;treatment. To our surprise, we did not see a reduction in STING protein level in cGAMP&#8208;stimulated BMDCs. However, this has also been observed in other studies on BMDCs [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Upon STING activation, RIPK3 can be activated by autologously produced IFN&#8208;I and TNF&#8208;&#945;, mediating sustained STING activation by preventing STING autophagy [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is likely that the observed long stability of STING is caused by RIPK3 activation.</p><p>In the TME, there is a substantial amount of cell death with the release of immune&#8208;stimulating molecules, including DNA and possibly cGAMP, which can affect the activity of tumor&#8208;infiltrating immune cells [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Elevated cell death in tumors can lead to an antitumoral immune reaction, which likely contributes to the effect of conventional cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A therapeutic caspase inhibition has the potential to induce necroptosis in cancer cells and, at the same time, activate intratumoral DCs. We investigated the effect of caspase inhibition in co&#8208;cultures with DCs and L929 cancer cells and showed that this leads to cell death in the L929 cells, while no death is induced in the DCs. Under normal in vitro induction of necroptosis, other factors such as TNF&#8208;&#945; are necessary to drive the response [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We show that no additional signal is needed for the induction of L929 cell death when these are co&#8208;cultured with DCs, which could be due to cytokines secreted from the DCs that deliver the extra signal to the L929 cells. Indeed, we observed a secretion of the NF&#8208;&#954;B and ISG&#8208;regulated cytokine, CXCL10, upon DC maturation. Moreover, we find that adding supernatant from mature DC cultures to L929 cells with concomitant zVAD stimulation is sufficient to drive L929 cell death, and the effect was inhibited by the addition of a TNFR1&#8208;blocking antibody, indicating that the co&#8208;stimulatory signal is DC&#8208;derived TNF&#8208;&#945;. Interestingly, we found that the DC supernatant combined with zVAD did not induce L929 cell death when DCs were pretreated with the GW806742X, indicating that the effect was dependent on nonnecroptotic RIPK1&#8208;RIPK3&#8208;MLKL activity in the DCs. Other nonnecroptotic functions of the pathway have previously been described; however, not in DCs [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="eji70044-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Necroptotic cancer cells are known to be able to activate DCs and induce antitumor immunity [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We investigated the effect of stimulating DCs with medium from apoptotic or necroptotic cells, which showed that the supernatant from necroptotic cells is sufficient to induce a maturation response in the DCs, indicating that factors secreted or released by the necroptotic cells are influencing DC maturation. Necroptotic cells are known to release several DAMPs, including DNA, &#8220;find me&#8221; signals, alarmins, and heat&#8208;shock proteins [<xref rid="eji70044-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Overall, these findings illustrate a synergistic effect of the STING pathway and non&#8208;cell death effects of the necroptosis pathway in DCs, ultimately leading to the induction of necroptosis in cancer cells. Our findings add to the understanding of necroptosis&#8208;independent function of the RIPK1&#8208;RIPK3&#8208;MLKL axis and indicate a double function of necroptosis signaling in cancer regulation, where it has opposite effects on cancer cells and DCs. These results give rise to potential exploitation in a therapeutic setting, by the combination of already existing cell death&#8208;inducing therapeutics and caspase inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="eji70044-sec-0080"><label>4</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="eji70044-sec-0090"><label>4.1</label><title>Cell Cultures</title><p>The murine fibroblast cancer cell line L929 (kindly provided by Prof. S&#248;ren R.
