MCs can be retained for 1&#8211;4 weeks and offer several advantages, including a high success rate of insertion and a good safety profile.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 2</sup></xref> Terminology for catheters of varying lengths remains uncertain, with devices measuring 6&#8211;15&#8201;cm referred to as MCs, long peripheral catheters, mini-MCs or short MCs with the terminal tip located at the level of the axilla in various clinical studies.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Catheters of length 15&#8211;30&#8201;cm are usually defined as &#8216;midline catheters&#8217; or &#8216;midclavicular&#8217;,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and their tips are usually located in the axillary or subclavian vein within a larger diameter vessel with a faster blood flow, contributing to their growing application in clinical settings.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> However, discrepancies in the medication indications for MCs (15&#8211;30&#8201;cm) persist across medical institutions and professional organisations.</p><p>Currently, drug indications are not distinguished based on the tip location of MCs. A general consensus supports the use of MCs for infusion of medications that are well-tolerated in the peripheral veins, specifically those with a pH between 5 and 9 and an osmolality of &lt;900&#8201;mOsm/L.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The 2024 version of infusion therapy practice standards expanded MC indications to include intermittent infusion of irritating and lytic medications, in addition to antibiotics, fluids and well-tolerated analgesics.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Caparas <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> confirmed the safety of vancomycin (pH 3.9) infusion for &#8804;6&#8201;days,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and other studies have reported successful MC use across specialities for iloprost or alprostadil therapy and nutrition solutions, etc.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In these studies, catheter tips were positioned in the distal axillary vein, with catheter lengths &lt;15&#8201;cm. No unified guideline exists regarding indications for the catheter with tips located in the axillary vein of the chest wall or subclavian vein. According to the 2020 Chinese consensus on the clinical application of MCs, the indications for MCs measuring 20&#8211;30&#8201;cm are continuous infusion of isotonic or near-isotonic medications, short-term intravenous administration of vancomycin (&lt;6&#8201;days) and patients requiring ongoing sedation and analgesia.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Previous studies have reported significantly lower incidence of MC-related complications when antibiotics were infused through MCs measuring 25&#8201;cm compared with catheters with the terminal tip located at the level of the axilla.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Additionally, successful use of MCs for vasoactive drug administration has been documented across various specialities.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15 16</sup></xref></p><p>Therefore, medication indications for infusion via MCs should be stratified based on the tip position. Given the lack of clinical guidelines and evidence regarding the use of irritating medications via MCs measuring &gt;15&#8201;cm, this study aims to collect real-world data on the infusion of irritant drugs through MCs measuring &gt;15&#8201;cm with tips located in the subclavian and axillary veins. We will establish a cohort to assess the infusion of irritating medications via MCs, exploring the outcomes based on tip positions. Specifically, we will analyse the relationship among medication dosage, duration of infusion, intimal injury and the incidence of catheter-related complications. This research aims to provide a basis for the clinical application of MCs (&gt;15&#8201;cm) for infusing irritating medications and offer evidence for revising infusion practice guidelines, ultimately reducing unnecessary placements of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and central venous catheters (CVCs), lowering healthcare costs, ensuring patient safety and minimising adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This longitudinal prospective cohort study on the infusion of irritant drugs through MCs will be conducted in mainland Chinese hospitals from June 2024 to March 2025 in 12 large comprehensive hospitals in the east, west, south and north of China.

The 31 provinces were first stratified by the seven administrative regions (Northeast, North, Northwest, East, Central, South and Southwest). Subsequently, specific provinces from all seven geographic regions were selected to ensure national representation of the economic level and population sizes. The 12 selected provinces included Heilongjiang from Northeast China; Shanxi from North China; Shaanxi from Northwest China; Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Fujian from East China; Henan and Hunan from Central China; Guangdong from South China; and Sichuan and Chongqing from Southwest China. In each selected province, the second-stage sampling criteria were based on the annual catheterisation volume of MCs, disease coverage, hospital level and hospital nature in each province. Comprehensive tertiary grade A hospitals with annual catheterisation volumes exceeding 1000 cases and active catheter use in internal medicine, surgery, oncology and intensive care units were selected. One hospital from each selected province was then randomly selected by drawing lots.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Study procedure</title><p>To ensure quality control, we will conduct random audits of consent documents and perform a centralised verification of consent dates relative to the study procedures.

To ensure consistency across the 12 hospitals, standardised training of the participating researchers was completed prior to data collection. From January to May in 2024, we organised two online meetings and one in-person training session, including an introduction to the aims, procedures, quality control processes and standardised data collection methods using the online management system for researchers. The ultrasound physicians were trained in ultrasound examination of vascular intima conditions through theoretical lectures, practical operations and evaluation. Clinical data were collected by trained research coordinators (who obtain baseline data and catheter placement information on patient enrolment), whereas follow-up personnel are responsible for recording catheter-related complications and catheter functional status. Standardised case report forms (CRFs) are used for data collection, and data are then entered by separate data entry personnel via the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. All personnel involved are independent from direct patient care. Strict role separation is maintained throughout the assessment process to prevent any potential bias and ensure independent assessments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Enrolment and baseline evaluation</title><p>Researchers from 12 main sampling sites meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will invite all eligible patients to participate in the study. To improve the enrolment rate, before enrolment, the hospital&#8217;s research group will distribute a brochure to inform patients undergoing catheterisation about the study.</p><p>Baseline data collection includes the following steps: data collection will begin following consent and enrolment. The first visit will occur on the day of catheter insertion. Prior to obtaining consent and conducting baseline evaluations of patients, the research coordinator will inform the patients or guardians about the research status. Catheter-related data will be collected by the inserter at each centre, including precatheterisation vascular intima condition assessed via ultrasound and the position of the catheter tip confirmed via radiography after catheterisation. The general demographic information, disease-related baseline information and blood test data of the patients can be accessed from the hospital&#8217;s information system. Partially missing medical history and disease history will be obtained from the patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Follow-up will be conducted once daily until catheter removal. Considering the typical retention time of 1&#8211;4 weeks of MCs, the maximum follow-up time for catheters without removal is set at 2 months. The follow-up procedure is as follows: daily direct and indirect follow-up will be conducted after the baseline survey to monitor catheter-related complications, catheter function and blood collection via catheter. Intravenous medication data will be collected daily through the online management system of the hospital following initial enrolment. The patients will be invited to undergo an ultrasound examination of the vascular intima once a week, followed by a final ultrasound examination after catheter removal. Catheter removal will be determined by the physicians and nurses based on the assessment visits and clinical indications. An ultrasound will be performed to confirm complication subtypes (eg, catheter dislodgement and thrombus formation in the vein) by a trained ultrasound physician. Indirect follow-up of the patient&#8217;s surgical history during the catheter indwelling period will be conducted using the electronic medical record data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Outcome measurements</title><p>The main outcome of this study is vascular intimal injury. During recruitment, ultrasound physicians will evaluate the condition of the vascular intima before puncture. Following enrolment, ultrasound will be performed weekly to monitor changes in the vascular intima. Ultrasound images of the vascular intima will be saved. All vascular intima ultrasound evaluations will be performed by certified ultrasound physicians who are not involved in direct patient care and will be blinded to patients' specific medications. Standardised evaluation criteria will be applied, and regular quality control checks will be conducted. Notably, images and videos suggestive of vascular intimal injury will be forwarded to a second physician for diagnostic confirmation.</p><p>The secondary outcomes include catheter-related complications related to vascular intimal injury, including phlebitis, catheter-related thrombosis, occlusion and catheter-related infections. The definitions and grading criteria for phlebitis will follow the ninth edition of the Infusion Nurses Society Standards of Practice.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Occlusion is defined as a notable decrease or complete cessation in the infusion rate, resistance or inability to flush the catheter, inability to withdraw blood or sluggish blood return. Catheter-associated infections encompass localised infections at the puncture site and catheter-associated bloodstream infections, as diagnosed using relevant criteria from the guidelines. Catheter-associated thrombosis is characterised by a thrombotic clot, with clinical indications resembling deep vein thrombosis, including pain, redness, swelling and tenderness in the affected area, diagnosed using ultrasound. Additionally, catheter-related complications will be assessed uniformly by trained research staff following standardised evaluation protocols with predefined complication criteria. These assessors will solely document the presence/absence of complications, whereas medication infusion data will be extracted separately from the medical records by other research staff, maintaining blinding to treatment information throughout the complication assessment process. In addition, data regarding other catheter-related complications, catheter indwelling time and removal due to complications will also be recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Data collection</title><p>All enrolled patients will be assigned a unique study identification number to record the participant-level data while protecting their confidentiality. Personally identifiable information, including names, ID numbers, phone numbers, birth dates and addresses, will be excluded from the electronic database and instead securely maintained at each of the 12 participating research centres, either in paper or electronic format (linked to research IDs). Clinical data will be collected by trained research coordinators, follow-up personnel and ultrasound physicians using standardised CRFs, independent from direct patient care. Subsequent data entry will be performed by data entry personnel in a password-protected EDC system featuring built-in range checks and validation rules. Medication infusion data will be extracted separately from medical records. All data in the EDC system will then be verified by two independent researchers before database submission to minimise missing or erroneous data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Quality control</title><p>The quality control committee includes principal collaborators and research management personnel from all 12 participating institutions, along with representatives from the Ethics Committee of the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital. As China&#8217;s leading hospital for MC irritant drug research, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital oversees study design, training, quality control, database management, and primary data analysis, ensuring compliance with national human research regulations. Formal data management agreements were established with all participating hospitals prior to study commencement.</p><p>To ensure data accuracy and objectivity in our multicentre study, all trained researchers (independent from clinical care teams) will collect clinical data using standardised CRFs. These data are entered into our EDC system by data entry personnel (separate from clinical data collection staff). The system includes automated range checks and validation rules to detect anomalies. To minimise bias and ensure objective assessment, strict role separation is maintained throughout the study: ultrasound evaluators, complication monitors and medication data extractors operate independently. Each participating hospital will implement local quality controls, including random audits of 20% of cases against source documents, whereas the lead research institution will conduct weekly monitoring to resolve discrepancies and ensure consistency across participating hospitals. Additionally, inspections will be performed by the leading centre every 2 months to evaluate local compliance with research procedures, including data collection, storage and transmission. The EDC system enforces role-based access controls and maintains a full audit trail of all modifications. All source documents, whether paper or electronic, will be retained for 5 years post-study per regulatory requirements, with strict protocols ensuring confidentiality and security throughout the study duration.</p><p>To ensure consistency in the study across different environments, a pilot study will be conducted in the leading research centre to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed study procedures for all 12 major sampling points, and the procedures will be revised as needed based on the results of the pilot study. The specific objectives of the pilot study are as follows: (1) to test the effectiveness of quality control and data input procedures, (2) to ensure a sufficient number of samples in different regions, (3) to establish unified parameters for ultrasound examination in all participating general hospitals and (4) to ensure procedural consistency across all study sites by implementing uniform standards for MC placement. The key requirements for MC placement include that all catheters are inserted by dedicated vascular access nurses (&#8805;100 MC placements/year) and placed in the mid-upper arm (Zone three per INS standards) with a catheter-to-vein ratio &lt;45% (confirmed via ultrasound).</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Three main analyses will be conducted with statistical significance set at two-sided p&lt;0.05.</p><p>The first set of analyses will focus on describing patient characteristics and the use of MCs for infusing stimulating drugs. This includes the incidence of vascular intimal damage during catheter use and related complications. The analysis will encompass the incidence rates, regional characteristics and demographic features. Qualitative data will be presented as frequency tables, percentages or composition ratios. Normally distributed quantitative data will be expressed as mean&#177;SD. For statistical comparisons across demographic subgroups, &#967;<sup>2</sup> tests will be used for count data, t-tests for quantitative data and rank sum tests for ordinal data.</p><p>The primary outcome measure is vascular intimal injury, whereas secondary outcomes include catheter-related complications. Comprehensive comparisons will be conducted, including binary analyses (patients receiving any irritant drugs vs those receiving only non-irritant drugs) and more detailed multicategory comparisons based on the risk level of irritant drugs (classified as no irritants, low-risk, moderate-risk and high-risk according to pH and osmolarity thresholds). Additionally, we will analyse groups based on the number of irritant drugs administered (none, single or multiple types) and perform drug class-specific subgroup analyses (eg, vasopressors, antibiotics and chemotherapeutics), adjusting for the cumulative infusion time.</p><p>To assess the confounding effects, unadjusted models will be compared with models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, medical history, admission diagnosis, length of hospital stay, catheterisation history, catheterisation site, limb selection, venous selection and number of puncture attempts. Regression models will be used to estimate the effect size and 95% CI for each unit difference in our results. In all statistical models, the drug type will be included as a covariate, along with other key adjustment factors, such as the cumulative exposure duration, catheter size and tip position, to ensure robust control for potential confounders. Additionally, we will employ a multidimensional approach to analyse the temporal effects, as follows: (1) longitudinal assessment of vascular intimal injury progression will be performed using generalised estimating equations (GEE) with time-varying covariates; (2) time-to-first intimal injury analysis will be conducted using Cox proportional hazards models, with catheter dwell time as the time scale (with left truncation for time-dependent exposures), and the same approach will be used for secondary outcomes; (3) cumulative exposure metrics (eg, irritant drug-days) will be calculated, and landmark analyses will be performed at days 7, 14, 21, 28 and beyond. All the models will be adjusted for baseline confounders (such as age, sex and BMI) to estimate the effect sizes (95% CIs) for exposure intensity (dose/frequency/duration) and different drug subcategories (extreme pH and hyperosmolar agents).</p><p>The third set will involve sensitivity analyses to determine the stability of the test results. For example, different models will be used to analyse stability by considering the use of stimulant drugs as exposure events. The exposure intensity will be calculated based on the days of usage and type of stimulant drug used. Furthermore, irritant drugs will be classified into subgroups, such as drugs with extreme pH, drugs with high osmolarity and vasopressors for subgroup analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Continuous infusion of irritant drugs is generally administered through a CVC.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18 19</sup></xref> However, with the increasing clinical use of MCs (&gt;15&#8201;cm), infusion of irritant drugs using MCs is safer than peripheral venous catheters. Short-term or intermittent infusion of irritating drugs through MCs does not increase the risk of vascular intimal injury and related complications.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Furthermore, replacing CVCs with MCs for the partial infusion of vasoactive drugs is safe and feasible, with no significant correlation with catheter-related complications.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><p>An animal study demonstrated that infusions of solutions with varying pH, osmolarity and cytotoxicity via a 10-cm MC resulted in severe vascular injury and premature catheter failure.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> However, this previous study was conducted in sheep; therefore, these findings are not generalisable to human populations with catheters longer than 15&#8201;cm. Another study reported that continuous intravenous infusion of vancomycin via MC inevitably leads to venous thrombosis<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>; however, the catheter used in this study was also a 15-cm long peripheral cannula (mini-midline). Although a few studies have investigated the use of catheters longer than 15&#8201;cm, they are all observational studies with small sample sizes, focusing primarily on clinical effects of several irritant drugs. Consequently, vascular changes during the infusion of irritant drugs remain unknown. Hence, large-scale longitudinal clinical studies are necessary, accounting for various interaction factors, such as different diseases, types of irritating drugs and various durations of therapy. Our cohort study on the infusion of irritant drugs via MCs in China aims to address this gap. Over time, we have identified numerous variables related to the infusion of irritant drugs through MCs. Our goal is to comprehensively evaluate the direct effects of infusion of irritant drugs through MCs on vascular intimal injury, as well as indirect complications caused by vascular intimal injury. We believe that this viewpoint will provide valuable guidance for medical staff in administering irritant drugs more safely via MCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study protocol and informed consent form have been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (approval number: 20240096, date of review: 20 February 2024).
