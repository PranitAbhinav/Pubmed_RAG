Current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are ineffective for about 30&#160;% of epileptic patients. AED use is extremely expensive and associated with adverse effects such as ataxia, nystagmus, and central nervous system depression. Serious quality-of-life changes are another aspect of managing epileptic conditions. A variety of therapeutic plant components, including flavonoids, phenolics, terpenoids, and alkaloids, exhibit a wide range of biological actions, including antibacterial, antioxidant, antiulcer, antineoplastic, anti-inflammatory, antiepileptic, and immunostimulant properties. Because many of them are being researched in modern research to develop an active therapeutic candidate, we resorted to medicinal plants to investigate powerful antiepileptic components. So, in this in silico study, we aimed to identify potential antiepileptic agents from <italic toggle="yes">Canarium odontophyllum</italic> fruits using molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and ADMET prediction approach. In the present study, the virtual screening was performed on a set of 63 phytocompounds, identified from the hydroalcoholic (70&#160;%) extract of <italic toggle="yes">C. odontophyllum</italic> fruit using LC-MS (LC-MS-QTOF) analysis, by using molecular docking simulation to examine their binding ability with seven proteins that are responsible for epilepsy. Further, the selected compounds with good binding affinity were subjected to ADMET screening to predict the pharmacokinetic properties, and molecular dynamics testing was done to confirm the outcomes. Our results revealed that <italic toggle="yes">C. odontophyllum</italic> phytoconstituents showed the strongest binding affinities against all tested enzymes. Moreover, kanzonol B could prominently interact with all tested proteins with moderate to good binding affinity (&#8722;6.70 to &#8722;10.65&#160;kcal/mol). All top phytoconstituents obeyed Lipinski&#8217;s RO5 and drug-likeness properties. These computational studies suggested that the phytoconstituents of <italic toggle="yes">C. odontophyllum</italic> can serve as potent inhibitors of enzymes responsible for epilepsy. Thus, we recommend further experimental investigations to validate the promising results of the present in silico study.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Epilepsy</kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Canarium odontophyllum</italic></kwd><kwd>Molecular docking</kwd><kwd>Pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>Drug-likeness profiles</kwd><kwd>Molecular dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term id="k0040">AEDs</term><def><p>antiepileptic drugs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0050"><italic toggle="yes">C. odontophyllum</italic></term><def><p><italic toggle="yes">Canarium odontophyllum</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0060">COFE</term><def><p>extract of <italic toggle="yes">C. odontophyllum</italic> fruits</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0070">PDFC</term><def><p>Compound identified in Positive ion chromatograph of dabai fruit extract</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0080">NDFC</term><def><p>Compound identified in Negative ion chromatograph of dabai fruit extract</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0090">GABA-T</term><def><p>Gamma-aminobutyrate aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0100">GABA(A)</term><def><p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0110">BCATm</term><def><p>Human mitochondrial branched chain aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0120">HVGSC</term><def><p>Human voltage-gated sodium channel, brain isoform (Nav1.2)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0130">AMPA</term><def><p>&#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0140">CDK2</term><def><p>Human Cyclin Dependent Kinase 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0150">LGI1</term><def><p>Leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0160">ARG1</term><def><p>Human arginase I</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0170">RMSD</term><def><p>Root mean square deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0180">RMSF</term><def><p>Root mean square fluctuation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0190">SASA</term><def><p>Solvent accessible surface area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0200">PSA</term><def><p>Polar surface area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0210">MolSA</term><def><p>Molecular surface area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0220">rGyr</term><def><p>Radius of gyration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0230">MD</term><def><p>Molecular dynamics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="k0240">PDB</term><def><p>Protein data bank</p></def></def-item></def-list></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">The pathophysiologic basis of epilepsy is an altered equilibrium of the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission present in the central nervous system leading to coordinated firing and neuronal hyper-excitability. The malfunctioning of voltage-gated ion channels, particularly, calcium and sodium, excessive glutamate signaling and/or insufficient GABA repression often occur as the dysregulations. The goal of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is to restore this balance. They act in numerous ways, including a direct modulation of ion channels and stabilized of neuron membranes and inhibition of paroxysmal depolarization, a decreased glutamatergic excitation and an enhanced GABA-induced inhibition. The current pharmacological treatment consists of many medications that have varying efficacy in different types of seizures and epilepsy syndromes. These drugs can be divided into those which belong to the first line (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate) and more recent (lamotrigine, levetiracetam, lacosamide, perampanel). There are a lot of key factors contributing to a large and ongoing study in this setting. Most noteworthy, a good population of patients, about one-third or so, enjoys drug-resistant epilepsy, where the patient still suffers seizures despite various AED therapies. In addition, some of the existing drugs are associated with severe side effects that reduce the quality of life of a patient, including mood alterations, effects on cognition, as well as systemic toxicities. Moreover, epilepsy is the third most common neurological condition in the world, with over 65 million people having the disease, and in Malaysia alone, about 1 in every 100 individuals has epilepsy. The utilization of AEDs is also expensive. It is, therefore, important to design newer AEDs with multitargeting and effective agents with an acceptable profile to increase the control of seizures and hopefully cure them.<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><p id="p0035">Canarium species of the Burseraceae family have been associated with neuroprotective benefits on a range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.

The system was standardized, and no changes in density, volume, or kinetic energies were detected (<xref rid="f0065" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15</xref> (a), (c), (e)).</p><p id="p0655">These fluctuations in RMSD (<xref rid="f0065" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15</xref> (i)) suggested that there might be a possible conformational change in the molecule. Kanzonol B showed an average rGyr value of 5.10&#160;&#197; during the 100&#160;ns MD simulation. The kanzonol B had demonstrated heavy fluctuation in rGyr throughout the simulation, indicating potential conformational changes during the simulation. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding was also observed within the ligand. These intramolecular hydrogen bonds contribute to the structural rigidity of the ligand. However, this rigidity may limit the ligand's ability to adapt to minor conformational changes in the binding site of the target, potentially reducing binding affinity. The MolSA was stable over most of the simulation time at around 316.34&#160;&#197;<sup>2</sup>. SASA estimates the area of a ligand&#8217;s surface exposed to solvent. The SASA of the ligand showed a significant fluctuation of up to 60&#160;ns of simulation and then gradually reached average equilibrium at 326.28&#160;&#197;<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="f0065" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15</xref> (i)). The PSA of the ligand remained stable over the simulation with an average PSA of 137.46&#160;&#197;<sup>2</sup>. Upon comparison with the reference standard ligand compound, the kanzonol B displayed better results with a higher average PSA of 137.46&#160;&#197;<sup>2</sup>, and MolSA of 316.34&#160;&#197;<sup>2</sup>, contributing to maintaining the stability of the ligand in the active site of the protein. However, the average SASA of kanzonol B was higher than that of the reference ligand, at 413.34&#160;&#197;<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="f0065" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15</xref> (i)). This higher SASA could be due to the ligand moving away from the protein or structural rearrangements that contribute to the low stability of the protein&#8211;ligand complex.</p><p id="p0660">The current research work is mainly concerned with the in-silico prediction of antiepileptic activity of phytoconstituents of <italic toggle="yes">C. odontophyllum</italic> fruits and in-silico validation only. Furthermore, the in vitro and in vivo studies of the antiepileptic activity of the identified compound are a must to validate the current prediction in this research work.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s0310"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0665">In the present study, we performed molecular docking studies to explore the affinity of phytoconstituents of <italic toggle="yes">C. odontophyllum</italic> fruits against the proteins responsible for epilepsy. Our molecular docking and dynamic study results indicated that a phytochemical compound, kanzonol B (PDFC32) of <italic toggle="yes">C. odontophyllum</italic> fruits, showed a strong binding affinity for the active sites of proteins related to epilepsy. The obtained results indicated that it would be an effective multi-targeted antiepileptic. It adheres to Lipinski&#8217;s rule, has good bioavailability, and possesses excellent GI absorption, CNS permeability, and BBB permeability. Most importantly, it is considered safe for use with the toxicity class of V. All these parameters make kanzonol B a potentially promising agent for epilepsy treatment. Promising results were also obtained via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis performed for four selected proteins (GABA-T, BCATm, Nav1.2 and LGI1) with kanzonol B. The RMSD and RMSF data confirmed the stability of proteins and ligands. The interaction between kanzonol B and the four selected proteins demonstrated that kanzonol B had good stability with the Human Voltage-gated Sodium Channel, brain isoform than other proteins. These computational studies suggested that kanzonol B may serve as a potent multi-targeted antiepileptic drug. However, further experimental studies and validations are important to confirm its potential for clinical use.</p></sec><sec id="s0315"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0670"><bold>Lim Joe Siang:</bold> Writing &#8211; original draft, Validation, Software, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation. <bold>Kamini</bold>
