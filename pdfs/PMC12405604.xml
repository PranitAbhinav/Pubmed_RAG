Food security is defined as, &#8216;when all people at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life&#8217; [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Underpinning this definition are six fundamental pillars&#8212;availability, access, utilisation, stability, sustainability and agency [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The disruption or absence of any of these pillars results in <italic toggle="yes">food insecurity</italic> [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Depending on the level of severity, food insecurity can range from anxiety that food will run out (marginal) to a decrease in the quality, quantity and variety of selected foods (moderate) to disruptions to an individual's eating patterns (severe) [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Food insecurity has been linked to an increased risk of chronic conditions, reduced well&#8208;being and in severe cases, nutritional deficiencies and delayed development in children [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Globally, food insecurity is a persistent challenge, with increasing rates in high&#8208;income countries, likely driven by inflationary pressures from events including the Ukraine war, the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions resulting from extreme weather events [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Within Australia, the rising cost of living is a significant contributor to the growing issue of food insecurity [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. During 2023&#8211;2024, an estimated 3.4 million Australian households reported moderate to severe food insecurity [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Food insecurity amongst low&#8208;income households rose to almost half (48%), representing a 5% rise in the proportion of affected households since 2022 [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Within Australia, certain demographic groups face elevated risks of food insecurity, including those who are unemployed, single&#8208;parent households, those renting accommodation and individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Low socioeconomic groups also experience higher rates of food insecurity [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, low socioeconomic groups have poorer dietary intakes related to lower intakes of fruit and vegetables&#160;[<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], less healthy food and beverages and similar intakes of discretionary foods compared to higher socioeconomic groups [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is likely related, in part, to the unaffordability of recommended diets and the perception that healthy foods are more expensive than unhealthy foods [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Consequently, there are higher rates of diet&#8208;related disease amongst this population [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The affordability of healthy and equitable diets is a fundamental component of food security [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To improve food security and reduce diet&#8208;related health inequities, continuing regular and comprehensive monitoring of food cost and affordability is essential to provide insights that can inform and guide policy initiatives. Within Australia, various &#8216;healthy food basket&#8217; surveys have been utilised to assess food cost and affordability [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], however, differences between protocols and methods hindered comparability [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additionally, previous methods have not provided an accurate representation of the cost of &#8216;current&#8217; Australian diets (i.e., the purchasing and eating behaviours of the population) compared to a &#8216;recommended&#8217; diet that is aligned with the Australian Dietary Guidelines [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To address the urgent call for robust and standardised data, the Healthy Diets Australian Standardised Affordability and Pricing (HD&#8208;ASAP) protocol was developed [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Aligning with the International Network for Food and Obesity/Non&#8208;Communicable Diseases Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS) &#8216;optimal approach&#8217; [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the five&#8208;part protocol aims to compare the cost and affordability of both recommended diets (based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines) and current diets (based on reported intakes in the 2011&#8211;2013 Australian Health Survey National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey [AHS NNPAS]) [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A modified version of the protocol, the low socioeconomic group HD&#8208;ASAP (Low SEG HD&#8208;ASAP) protocol [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], was developed to more closely align to the needs and personal experiences [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] of those in the lowest income quintile.</p><p>The Fowler electorate was selected for this investigation at the request of its Federal Member of Parliament, who expressed interest in obtaining information on the affordability of food to inform the enhancement of local&#8208;level initiatives and support advocacy efforts at the federal level. Situated in South&#8208;West Sydney, residents of the Fowler electorate experience particularly high rates of socioeconomic disadvantage [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Census data from 2021 revealed a majority of families comprised coupled families with children (48.6%) [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Single&#8208;parent families (23.1%), particularly led by female single parents (81.5%), were also notably present, as were single&#8208;person households (20.4%) [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As well as having high rates of individuals not in the labour force (49%), many residents live in rented accommodation (42.1%) and are culturally diverse (60.9% were born overseas, notably 31.8% of the population are from Vietnamese or Chinese backgrounds) [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It has been well documented that those at highest risk of food insecurity in Australia include unemployed people, single&#8208;parent households, low&#8208;income earners, rental households, as well First Nations, culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) and socially&#8208;isolated people [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, given the social, cultural and economic dynamics of the Fowler electorate, investigation into food cost and affordability in the region is warranted.</p><p>Therefore, this study aimed to assess the cost, cost differential and affordability of recommended and current diets, including costs based on prices of both popular &#8216;standard brands&#8217; and &#8216;cheapest alternative&#8217; options for various household structures and income types within the Fowler electorate. The findings will generate actionable insights to inform policy initiatives to help improve the affordability and consumption of healthy foods and ultimately contribute to increasing the food security of residents in the Fowler electorate and, more broadly, low socioeconomic groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="hpja70092-sec-0007"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>This cross&#8208;sectional study applied the Low SEG HD&#8208;ASAP protocol.

This finding is likely partly attributable to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) exemption that Australia applies to basic healthy foods [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and the inclusion of takeaway items and alcohol (particularly for adult males aged 31&#8211;50&#8201;years) within the current diet&#8208;pricing tools [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The present study identified that alcohol and takeaway items contributed to current diet costs by 7%&#8211;20% and 19%&#8211;27%, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of alcohol contributed to the greater cost differentials between recommended and current diets in Household 1 and, more conspicuously, Household 3, due to higher reported intakes by males compared to females. These findings confirm how the exclusion of these components could underestimate total diet costs, and indeed studies that have not considered these dietary components have suggested that &#8216;healthy diets&#8217; are more expensive than &#8216;current diets&#8217; [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

While recommended diets remained less expensive, the cost differential between recommended and current diets narrowed significantly in households with children, due to the greater cost reductions within current diets (33%&#8211;34%) in comparison to recommended diets (31%). This is likely a result of the widespread availability of unhealthier and ultra&#8208;processed food and beverage items which are more prominently included in the current diet pricing tool being available to purchase at cheaper costs.

Thus, variations in results are likely explained by the difference in current diet&#8208;pricing tools (i.e., different quantities of discretionary items compared to healthy foods) and the different price collection methodology (i.e., exclusion of budget supermarkets and inclusion of hot takeaway items compared to frozen equivalents) [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Overall, while results highlight the financial benefits when purchasing &#8216;cheapest alternatives&#8217;, the promotion of these must be approached with caution as they may have unintentional repercussions, including cost savings being utilised to purchase more unhealthier food and beverages [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the impact on the food system regarding long&#8208;term costs, consumer choice and market competition requires further consideration and investigation [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Our study adds further evidence to the hypothesis that food costs and household income have a strong influence on diet affordability [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our findings demonstrate that current diets were a greater financial burden on all households, particularly when purchasing &#8216;standard brands&#8217;.</p><p>Furthermore, despite recommended diets being less expensive, they remained unaffordable or caused &#8216;food stress&#8217; for many welfare&#8208;dependent and low&#8208;income families with children unless the &#8216;cheapest alternatives&#8217; were purchased. This aligns with a recent Australian systematic review [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] that identified that recommended diets were unaffordable for vulnerable population groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, those on low or welfare&#8208;dependent incomes and those residing in rural or remote areas. Studies by Lee et&#160;al. [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also demonstrated similar diet affordability estimates for low&#8208;income and welfare&#8208;dependent families with children; however, they further demonstrated that despite purchasing the &#8216;cheapest alternatives&#8217;, a recommended diet still caused &#8216;food stress&#8217; for welfare&#8208;dependent families of four [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Our findings should be further considered in the context of the rising cost of living within Australia since 2020, where all basic living expenses, including food, housing and utilities, transport and healthcare costs, have increased [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. While diet affordability is assessed against a benchmark of 30% [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], under financial constraints, the household food budget is perceived to be the most flexible expense and is likely to be reduced to compensate for other fixed expenses [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Within the Fowler electorate in 2021, almost one&#8208;half of those renting accommodation experienced &#8216;rental stress&#8217; (i.e., spending over 30% of household income on housing costs) [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Consequently, these households likely have less than 30% of income to spend on food. This exemplifies the economic challenges that may be experienced by many households within the Fowler electorate and highlights the increased risk of food insecurity.</p><p>Findings provide insights that can inform local&#8208;level initiatives and programmes aimed at improving food security in the Fowler electorate. Several council&#8208;supported low&#8208;cost and free meal services and community pantries operate within the Fowler electorate [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]; however, there is little evidence of other local food access or supply initiatives, highlighting a gap that findings of this study can help inform.</p><p>In collaboration with key stakeholders, initiatives may encompass expanding community gardens, farmers markets and community pantries to improve vulnerable households' access to healthy food. Implementing culturally appropriate nutrition education programmes can improve residents' budgeting strategies [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and understanding of how to grow, access and prepare affordable, healthy meals. Notably, the reduction of economic barriers would allow for greater success of these programmes [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While these strategies provide short&#8208;term relief, they do not address the underlying social determinants of food insecurity. The broader implications of this study highlight the urgent need for stronger fiscal policy measures. Increasing household income through adequate welfare and income support payments would enable vulnerable populations to afford their basic needs, including nutritious food&#8212;an issue consistently advocated by the Australian Council of Social Service [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated the increased income supplements provided by the Australian Government during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic enabled low&#8208;income and welfare&#8208;dependent families to afford a healthy diet [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A survey conducted during that period found that many welfare&#8208;dependent individuals reported eating healthier foods as a result [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These examples highlight the positive effect of enhancing welfare and income support payments to adequate levels to ensure recommended diets are affordable. If recommended diets were affordable for all, this would lead to enhanced learning outcomes for children, improved workforce engagement and productivity, greater community participation, reduced social and diet&#8208;related health inequalities and reduced strain on the healthcare system [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To improve food security amongst vulnerable population groups, ongoing monitoring of diet cost and affordability is essential to provide up&#8208;to&#8208;date evidence to inform policy and advocate for change.</p><p>The HD&#8208;ASAP protocols have methodological limitations that have been described previously [<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While the diet&#8208;pricing tools of the HD&#8208;ASAP protocols aim to include food and beverages that are accessible, commonly consumed and culturally acceptable&#160;[<xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="hpja70092-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], they may not be as representative of the eating and purchasing behaviours of households within locations with high rates of cultural diversity, such as the Fowler electorate. Future research should consider the adaptation of diet pricing tools to reflect culturally appropriate diets to better assess diet affordability within culturally diverse populations. Another methodological limitation is that the price collection protocols focus on larger supermarkets (where the majority of the diet can be purchased) and overlook smaller grocers, markets and independent stores, which may impact diet affordability estimates. Future studies within the Fowler electorate should consider including these stores to enable cost and affordability comparisons to further guide local&#8208;level initiatives. Finally, this study focused on diet affordability and did not consider other components of food security, such as food accessibility. Considering the unintentional finding that identified a low number of supermarket stores across the Fowler electorate, future research should consider a mapping study of the local food environment to identify if access barriers to healthy foods exist. Such information could inform local and state government planning and policy initiatives aimed at improving food security within the Fowler electorate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="hpja70092-sec-0021"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In a low socioeconomic region, despite recommended diets being less expensive than current diets, they were unaffordable or caused &#8216;food stress&#8217; for many low&#8208;income and welfare&#8208;dependent families with children unless the &#8216;cheapest alternatives&#8217; were purchased.</p><p>Implementation of local&#8208;level initiatives and programmes to improve food security and ensure individuals have access to sufficient quality and quantities of healthy foods is required.
