However, people with HIV continue to have poorer mental health compared to background populations, which may be linked to stigma, lack of social support, or socioeconomic challenges. Personalised care aims to improve the outcomes of people with long-term health conditions and the National Health Service (NHS) Long Term Plan looks to implement this (including access to health coaching and social prescribing). The SPHERE trial aims to assess whether a health and well-being coaching and social prescribing intervention improves patient-reported health and well-being among people living with HIV who have psychosocial needs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">SPHERE will be conducted across seven HIV outpatient clinics in England and is a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel group randomised controlled trial (RCT) embedding a routine assessment of psychosocial needs in HIV care. Eligibility criteria are people living with HIV aged 18 or older, available for the duration of study follow-up and scoring 16 or more on an assessment of psychosocial need: &#8220;Positive-Outcomes-11&#8221; (PO-11), covering physical, psychological, social and socioeconomic aspects of health and well-being. The RCT requires 568 participants who will be individually randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either a health and well-being coaching and social prescribing intervention or usual care. The intervention consists of up to eight coaching sessions that will be delivered by health professionals (e.g. HIV nurses) who have received specialist training to become health and well-being coaches. The trial will also include an internal pilot phase, process evaluation (to evaluate intervention feasibility, acceptability and mechanisms of action), economic evaluation (to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and impact on NHS resource use) and parallel observational study (to assess subsequent development of psychosocial needs among those not initially eligible for the trial). The primary outcome is defined as achieving a reduction in PO-11 score of at least 40% from baseline to 6&#160;months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes include symptoms of depression and anxiety, social support, self-stigma, coping self-efficacy, resilience, lifestyle factors and health-related quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The SPHERE trial will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of implementing psychosocial health and well-being coaching in a secondary HIV care setting.

A HIV diagnosis may result in anxiety and fears for the future and may also affect interpersonal relationships, impacting mental health and well-being. A further negative impact on health and well-being for people with HIV are experiences of socioeconomic disadvantage and lack of social support, factors that have extremely strong associations with poor mental health and reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, people with HIV experience different forms of stigma including perceived, internalised and intersectional, with stigma found to be associated with depressive symptoms, social exclusion and lower levels of social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

This may be partly due to the high levels of trust people with HIV have in HIV services and difficulties accessing primary care services.

The intervention has been co-developed with people with lived experience of HIV and experts in the fields of psychology, coaching and social prescribing including practitioners with extensive experience of delivering counselling and coaching to people living with HIV. The intervention was designed to include a focus on needs identified in the national Positive Voices survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Further details of the training are given below.</p><p id="Par107">Staff will book the participants randomised to the intervention for the initial health and well-being coaching session while in clinic. The HWCs delivering the intervention will conduct up to eight sessions with participants over a 3-month period, including a preliminary in-depth assessment that will last 1&#8211;2&#160;h. The initial sessions at least will be face-to-face; however, the format of delivery (face-to-face, by phone or online) will be agreed between the HWC and participant after the first face-to-face session. Sites that have more than one HWC trained to deliver the intervention will aim for participants to see the same HWC throughout the intervention. The HWCs delivering the intervention will ensure participants are in a safe and confidential environment if taking part by telephone or video call.</p><p id="Par108">Sessions will focus on establishing a relationship alliance between the HWC and participant, identifying priorities in the physical, mental or social health and well-being of the participant, and setting goals to address health and well-being needs. HWCs may support onward referral to local social prescribing initiatives, as required. For example, coaching may focus on:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par109">Offering support to increase self-efficacy, motivation and commitment to identify and make changes to lifestyle and improve health</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par110">Facilitating support with socioeconomic issues</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par111">Reducing social isolation and stigma</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par112">Improving mental health and emotional well-being</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par113">Improving health literacy.</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Intervention providers&#8217; training and support</title><p id="Par114">All HWCs delivering the intervention have received an accredited and bespoke training programme delivered by a not-for-profit organisation (Living Well CIC) that provides a range of mental health and well-being services, with over two decades of experience in the HIV sector. Training was delivered to 14 HIV health care professionals in early 2024 over 12&#160;weeks by a behavioural psychologist. The training programme involved 4&#160;days of face-to-face group training, 8&#160;weeks of skills practice and 2&#160;days of follow-up online group training. The training programme addresses a framework of 52 competencies that underpin health and well-being coaching and is accredited (Level 2 Qualification). All trainees completed pre- and post- &#8220;standardised patient&#8221; training assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] to provide an impact evaluation of the course and to identify areas of development or support. Standardised patient assessments involved people with HIV being specially trained to act as coaching participants for the practice and assessments of the HWCs undertaking the training.</p><p id="Par115">Social prescribing training was delivered by the London Regional Social Prescribing Unit in conjunction with the health and well-being coaching training. Training provided insight into the role and skills of a social prescribing link worker, the referral pathway and current social prescribing initiatives at a national level. The Unit also developed a social prescribing directory for each SPHERE site which outlines local community resources. These resources will be kept updated through the intervention HWCs and social prescribing trainers collaborating with local authority social prescribing link workers, Third Sector organisations and primary care local clinical networks.</p><p id="Par116">HWCs will be supervised and supported for the duration of the trial by a professional behavioural psychologist who co-led the health and well-being coaching training, at mandatory, small group (up to 4 people) monthly supervisions.

Data on change in symptom score from one occasion to another among people with an initially high score, based on an annual repeated assessment of the PHQ-9 in the Attitudes to, and Understanding of, Risk of Acquisition of HIV cohort study of HIV-negative MSM (AURAH2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] was used to inform the 40% reduction endpoint and the 25&#8211;35% range for the estimated proportion achieving this in the control group. It was judged that to justify implementing a new model of care, a difference of 15% in the primary outcome between intervention and control arms (25% versus 40%, or 35% versus 50%) would be the minimum clinically important difference. This difference equates to an odds ratio of between 1.86 and 2, equivalent to a standardised effect size of approximately 0.35, which is between a small and a medium effect according to Cohen&#8217;s criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. To detect a difference of 15% between arms if assuming success proportions of 35% and 50% in the control group and intervention group respectively (the most conservative scenario in terms of sample size) requires 454 participants overall, assuming 90% power and a 5% type I error rate. Allowing for 20% attrition, the overall sample size required for the RCT is 568 participants.</p><p id="Par128">This total sample size could be achieved with six study sites recruiting over 9&#160;months, with each site seeing over 2500 patients in clinic in this time. Using our previous experience of recruiting to observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], and assuming a lower participation acceptance rate, a researcher could approach over half of these 2500 patients, of which we assumed 40% would agree to participate in the first stage and complete the initial PO-11 screening questionnaire (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;500). Our initial work suggested that approximately 35% of the screened population will be eligible for the RCT (i.e. their PO-11 score will be&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;16). We assumed that a high percentage (90%) of those undertaking screening would agree to participate as participants have already consented at the first stage. This would result in 158 participants per site which meets our requirements.</p><p id="Par129">For the observational study, the primary endpoint is the proportion of participants with poor psychosocial health/well-being at 12&#160;months, defined as PO-11&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;16, among those who did not meet the criteria for the RCT at baseline. Data from the AURAH2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] suggested that up to a third of participants may fulfil this criterion at the 12-month timepoint. We wish to estimate this percentage to within 10% accuracy (i.e. 95% confidence interval total width of 10%)). Assuming 33% of participants in the observational cohort have PO-11&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;16 at 12&#160;months, using the exact binomial method we would require 358 individuals. Accounting for 10% loss to follow up, we will recruit 398 participants. Loss-to-follow-up is assumed lower than in the RCT, as the study only requires completion of a questionnaire,&#160;at month 12 which can be done in tandem with a routine clinic appointment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Patient and public involvement (PPI)</title><p id="Par130">We have an established PPI Advisory Group which continues to inform all aspects of the trial and the pre-trial formative work.

The group continues to be involved as the trial progresses.</p><p id="Par131">As part of the formative work for the trial, we conducted a series of focus group discussions with people living with HIV and key informant interviews with clinical and non-clinical HIV workers to inform the design of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Additionally, we held two Theory of Change workshops in September 2023, to shape the intervention parameters and map the key components of the intervention to be trialled in the RCT. A significant proportion of attendees (over a third) at the workshops were people with lived experience; specifically, eight members of the PPI Advisory Group had key roles at the workshops including co-facilitating group activities. Other attendees included NHS commissioners, academics, health psychologists, clinicians (e.g. nurses and consultants) and charity and Third Sector staff. The workshops ensured the intervention was relevant, inclusive and reflective of the needs of the target population for the study.</p><p id="Par132">To support the development of the HWCs training package, in January 2024, six members of the PPI Advisory Group underwent a 3-hour&#160;training session to become &#8220;standardised patients&#8221; to provide pre- and post- training assessments for the trainee HWCs. Involving people living with HIV ensured that real-world experiences (e.g. HIV-related stigma) were integrated into the training assessments. Individual online sessions were then organised between trainee coaches and a standardised patient within 2&#160;weeks prior to the training (pre-course assessment) as well as within 2&#160;weeks of the training course being completed (post-assessment).</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Data collection, management and confidentiality</title><p id="Par133">Participants will be able to select their preferred method for data collection which may include a link by text message or email, or completing the assessment online in clinic, or completing a paper questionnaire either in person at the clinic or later to be returned by post to the site.</p><p id="Par134">Data will be managed using the SPHERE database stored on secure servers controlled by the University of Birmingham. Participants will give explicit consent for the transfer and storage of their personal data on the trial database which will also be used to centrally monitor the consent process. Entries from any paper questionnaires and forms will be transcribed to the online database. The SPHERE Data Management Plan (available on request) will outline data entry processes and other procedures to facilitate accuracy and data completeness.</p><p id="Par135">Source data will be accessible and maintained to allow for accurate reconstruction of trial and clinical management of participants. This will include participant questionnaires, clinical forms (baseline, 6&#160;months and 12&#160;months), recruitment and withdrawal records. Archiving will be authorised by the trial coordinating centre on behalf of the Sponsor (University of Birmingham) following the submission of an end of trial report. The trial master file will be stored at BCTU for at least 3&#160;years after the end of the trial with data stored securely and confidentially for at least 10&#160;years in long-term offsite data archiving facilities.</p><p id="Par136">Any personal and sensitive data collected will be held confidentially and stored in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 (and subsequent amendments). Personal data collected includes full name and date of birth, contact details and sensitive personal data may include medical history and demographic data. A unique SPHERE identification number will be used to identify participants and will be used for any correspondence with the trial office. If a participant requests a link to access follow-up questionnaires to be sent by text message, their phone number will be shared with a UK-based General Data Protection Regulation compliant third-party SMS platform where there is also a data sharing agreement with the provider. Confidentiality will be upheld at all times and the SPHERE team will not disclose participant identifiable data to any third party, unless in very specific circumstances such as specific issues or queries from regulatory authorities or for quality assurance purposes (by representatives of the SPHERE trial team and Sponsor).</p><p id="Par137">We will grant access to the final dataset to the statistical team who will undertake the final analyses. Any additional requests for data access will be considered by the trial co-ordinating centre which will require a formal data sharing agreement before fully de-identified (anonymised), or participant identifiable, data can be released and transferred using a secure and encrypted method. Any requests for data access will be reviewed by the BCTU Data Sharing Committee, the Chief Investigator and, where necessary, the SPHERE Sponsor, relevant Trial Management Group members and/or independent Trial Steering Committee. Data will be available for potential data sharing approximately 6&#160;months after the primary publication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Data monitoring</title><p id="Par138">The trial will be coordinated by the BCTU based at the University of Birmingham. The Trial Management Group will include people responsible for day-to-day trial management including the Chief Investigator, co-lead, project manager, PPI manager, trial statisticians, trial management team leader and trial manager. The group will monitor all aspects of trial conduct and progress, adherence to the trial protocol and act to safeguard trial participants and the quality of the trial.</p><p id="Par139">The trial will also have a Programme Steering Committee (PSC) or Joint Oversight Committee for SPHERE, which includes independent and non-independent members, PPI and community representatives, overseeing the conduct of the NICHE programme. The PSC will meet annually or more frequently depending on the needs of the trial. The Committee will provide oversight to the trial, monitor trial progress and conduct and provide advice on scientific credibility. This will also encompass a data monitoring safety board role.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Adverse event reporting and harms</title><p id="Par140">The trial is a very low-risk study. The SPHERE intervention is not considered to present a risk to participants nor is there considered to be any higher risk than the risk of usual care. As the trial is not a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (CTIMP), we do not plan to use the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) to report harms as this was developed to facilitate sharing of regulatory information internationally for medical products. However, adverse events (AE) will be recorded and reported according to the UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research, the Principles of Good Clinical Practice as set out in the UK Statutory Instrument (2004/1031; and subsequent amendments) and the requirements of the Health Research Authority.</p><p id="Par141">Information on harms will be collected informally in those receiving the intervention by the HWCs through the health and well-being coaching diary. We will report any, and all, identified harms including any reported via AEs or severe AEs (SAEs) reported, where this constitutes as an SAE. We will report SAEs related to SPHERE from randomisation until the end of trial follow-up. There will be no safety reporting for observational participants. Only SAEs will be reported to the trial office (including death, life-threatening condition, non-elective hospitalisation). In addition, all SAEs will be recorded in medical notes and reported to the Trust, according to local requirements. Any SAEs requiring non-expedited reporting to the trial office must be done within 28&#160;days of becoming aware (for instance, hospitalisations related to HIV or other pre-existing conditions; hospital admissions lasting less than 24&#160;h related to mental health issues). SAEs which do not require reporting to the trial office should be included in medical notes (for instance, pre-planned hospitalisations, hospital admissions lasting less than 24&#160;h and unrelated to mental health issues). All other SAEs should be reported to the trial office in an expedited manner within 24&#160;h of the site research team becoming aware of the event.</p><p id="Par142">The Sponsor will notify the Research Ethics Committee (REC) of any serious breaches to the conditions and principles of Good Clinical Practice related to the trial conduct or protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Auditing</title><p id="Par143">All trial sites will be monitored according to a monitoring plan and trial risk assessment conducted by BCTU and University of Birmingham staff.

Automatic range checks will be conducted by the data capture system to check for data quality. Any queries relating to missing data or to clarify inconsistencies or discrepancies in the data will be sent as data clarification forms to sites on a regular basis.</p><p id="Par144">Any protocol amendments such as changes to the study eligibility criteria, outcomes, analyses will gain necessary local approvals, be updated on the trial registration website and reported to investigators.

For example, the intervention could increase engagement with social prescribing and alcohol prevention programmes but may also reduce both scheduled and non-scheduled contacts with secondary care services. We will use generalised linear modelling to analyse categories of cost to handle potential skewness (we anticipate using a gamma distribution family with log link). Aggregated non-significant difference in total costs will only be presented if there is evidence of significant cost-offsets attributable to the intervention. Otherwise, the cost of the intervention will be assumed to represent the best estimate of the true intervention cost.</p><p id="Par178">Data from the EQ-5D-5L at baseline, 6&#160;months and 12&#160;months will be mapped to utility index scores from the 3-level version of the score as recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. We will analyse data using a generalised linear model on dis-utility (1&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;EQ-5D-DL utility score) to allow for potential skewness together with clustering to allow for repeated measures from the same individual and obtain robust standard errors. The average EQ-5D-5L utility score predicted will be interpreted as a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as the time frame of the analysis is one whole year.</p><p id="Par179">An analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the coaching intervention will be performed by combining the statistical equations for healthcare resource cost and 1-year EQ-5D-5L (or QALY).

This is timely given the NHS model of personalised care being implemented across England with an aim to improve support and outcomes for people with long-term conditions and make the NHS more sustainable. The evidence base for a personalised care approach still lags behind policy implementation in the UK and significant methodological limitations exist with the sparse research to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This work will contribute to filling the evidence gap for more robust, higher-quality research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p id="Par184">A strength of the trial is continuous stakeholder involvement which will enable the timely application of findings. SPHERE has been co-developed with people living with HIV. Our PPI advisory group were integral to the design of the intervention through Theory of Change workshops, the intervention training through the co-production of training assessments and the co-development of the participant-facing material in the trial. Ensuring that PPI are involved across the management of the trial with representatives on the Trial Steering Committee as well as the Trial Management Group has facilitated their feedback into all aspects of the trial design and implementation.</p><p id="Par185">SPHERE also has two sub-studies embedded within the work which will strengthen its implementation. First, the process evaluation will allow the trial team to reflect and adapt the trial as it begins to recruit participants and identify challenges and provide potential solutions to these, as the trial progresses. Critical evaluation of localised implementation processes affords a more detailed understanding of how the intervention may be applied, and translates, across different settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Secondly, the economic evaluation will present an opportunity to explore the cost-saving implications, if any, for the NHS and sustainability of the intervention in the long term. The intervention is designed to address needs identified by previous research among people living with HIV in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; however, we acknowledge that there is not yet scope to develop the intervention to provide support in additional languages within this programme of research.</p><p id="Par186">Learnings from the trial have the potential to be applied in other health areas. Although the specific components of a psychosocial needs assessment and intervention may vary in different settings, the principles may be transferable to other chronic and potentially stigmatising medical conditions treated primarily in specialist or hospital settings. Future work may consider the potential adaptation and application of the intervention to other patient populations with chronic diseases attending secondary care services (for example, chronic respiratory or renal disease, diabetes, etc.).</p><sec id="Sec45"><title>Dissemination plans</title><p id="Par187">A multi-dimensional approach will be developed to deliver key information for people with HIV, programme participants, service providers, policymakers, health care commissioners and the research community.
