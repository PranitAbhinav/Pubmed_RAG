Here we uncover a role of SOX2 in promoting global histone acetylation in esophageal squamous cancer cells (ESCCs). Mechanistic studies reveal that SOX2 promotes global histone acetylation in an AKT-independent manner, and does so by promoting histone acetylation at both SOX2 binding and non-SOX2 binding sites, and accounts for the formation of about half of the super-enhancers. Combined metabolic and transcriptional analyses reveal two mechanisms by which SOX2 enhances global histone acetylation: promoting the expression of multiple histone acetyltransferases and reducing acetyl-CoA consuming fatty acid synthesis in part by repressing the expression of ACSL5. Finally, SOX2 expression correlates negatively with ACSL5 and positively with histone acetylation in clinical esophageal squamous tumors. Altogether, our study uncovers a role of SOX2 in reprogramming lipid metabolism and driving histone hyperacetylation and super-enhancer function, providing mechanistic insights of SOX2 acting as a potent oncodriver.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">SOX2 is known to be oncogenic in squamous cell carcinomas.

SOX2 is a key pioneer transcription factor (TF) that plays a vital role in embryonic stem cells and marks bona fide stem cells in adult tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Notably, SOX2 is also a squamous lineage-specific TF that is overexpressed in various SCCs and promotes tumor cell proliferation, cancer stem-cell activity, invasion, metastasis and therapeutic resistances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.

The molecular mechanism by which SOX2 exerts as a potent oncogenic determinant for SCCs, however, is not fully understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Reprogramming cellular metabolic pathways such as augmenting glycolysis to meet the enhanced needs for rapid proliferation is a hallmark of tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Acetyl-CoA is a central metabolite that links glucose, glutamine and lipid metabolism and cellular signaling together<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Acetyl-CoA is produced by glucose metabolism, fatty acid &#946;-oxidation and other metabolic processes, and serves as the substrate for de novo fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis and the donor for acetylation of histone and nonhistone proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Histone acetylation catalyzed by lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) has critical roles in regulation of chromatin accessibility and formation of super-enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

The global level of histone acetylation is sensitive to the production and availability of acetyl-CoA. In this regard, AKT has been shown to elevate acetyl-CoA level and drive histone acetylation and pancreatic cancer progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. As a master TF of various stem cells and squamous lineage cells, SOX2 has been well documented for recruitment of various KATs for local histone acetylation in chromatin and transcriptional regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

SOX2 controls squamous lineage transcription program and, strikingly, is required for the formation of nearly half of the super-enhancers in ESCC cells. We elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which SOX2 enhances global histone acetylation and super-enhancer function and demonstrated that SOX2 expression positively correlates with histone acetylation status in clinical ESCC specimens.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>SOX2 enhances global histone acetylation in ESCC cells</title><p id="Par6">We have previously demonstrated that in mouse embryonic stem cells and ESCCs, AKT stabilizes and drives SOX2 overexpression by protecting SOX2 from proteasome degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Given that AKT has been shown to promote pancreatic tumor progression by enhancing histone acetylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, we attempted to investigate whether AKT also promotes histone acetylation in ESCC cells. We thus examined the status of AKT, SOX2 and histone acetylation among a panel of ESCC-derived KYSE cell lines (K cell lines hereafter). As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Western blot (WB) analysis did not reveal a significant correlation between the levels of AKT and that of histone acetylation. Instead, we noticed an imperfect correlation between the levels of SOX2 and that of histone acetylation. To test whether AKT promotes histone acetylation in ESCC cells, we treated both SOX2-positive and negative ESCC cells with a potent AKT inhibitor, MK2206<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. As expected, addition of MK2206 markedly inhibited AKT kinase activity, as evidenced by a significant reduction of serine 473 -phosphorylated, active AKT (pS473-AKT1) but with no change of total levels of AKT protein in all cell lines tested (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Notably, we observed that inhibition of AKT resulted in reduction of acetylation of both histones H3 and H4 only in SOX2-positive but not in SOX2-negative ESCC cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Consistent with our previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, inhibition of AKT by MK2206 markedly reduced the SOX2 protein level in SOX2-positive cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Furthermore, MK2206 reduced the levels of both SOX2 and histone acetylation in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). These results raised the possibility that SOX2 but not AKT may control global histone acetylation in ESCC cells.<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>SOX2 potently promotes global histone acetylation in ESCCs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Western blot analyses of the levels of AKT1, SOX2, and histone acetylation in ESCC cell lines (Kyse) and cervical cancer cell line C33A.

SOX2 KD had no effect on AKT1 protein level and its active marker S473 phosphorylation, but resulted in reduction of histone H3 and H4 acetylation in all SOX2-positive ESCC cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), and reduction of histone acetylation upon SOX2 KD was confirmed in biological replicates by WB analysis using H3 and H4 acetylation site-specific antibodies (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Similarly, knockout of SOX2 by three distinct SOX2-specific guide RNAs via CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in reduction of global histone acetylation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Notably, ectopic expression of SOX2 restored the histone acetylation level in SOX2 KD K30 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>), confirming a role of SOX2 in regulating global histone acetylation. The K30 cells were used in this rescue experiment because this cell line allowed us to do both SOX2 KD and overexpression in the same cell line, own to its moderate level of SOX2 expression. Furthermore, ectopic expression of SOX2 in SOX2-negative K410 cells resulted in an obvious increase of acetylated histones and acetylated non-histone proteins (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). By immunofluorescent staining, we also observed that ectopic expression of SOX2 resulted in substantial elevation of histone acetylation in K30 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). Regulation of histone acetylation by SOX2 is likely independent of AKT kinase activity, because inhibition of AKT did not further reduce histone acetylation level in SOX2 KD K450 cells (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>) and ectopic overexpression of SOX2 did not alter AKT1 protein level and activation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). Furthermore, regulation of histone acetylation by SOX2 is unlikely an ESCC specific event, as SOX2 KD in two lung cancer cell lines also resulted in a similar global reduction of histone acetylation (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). We also validated by histone acetylation site-specific antibodies that SOX2 KD in K450 cells resulted in global reduction of H3K9ac and H3K27ac (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>). Notably, regulation of global histone acetylation is likely a unique feature of SOX2, because neither ectopic expression of MYC nor OCT4, two other ES core TFs, was able to enhance global histone acetylation in K30 cells (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>).

K450 cells were chosen because it showed a mid-high level of SOX2 protein expression among SOX2-positive ESCC cell lines (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). A total of 23,621 SOX2 chromatin binding events were identified in K450 cells.

Notably, 38.7% and 31.1% of SOX2 binding events occurred at enhancers and promoters, respectively (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, upper panel), consistent with its role in gene expression reported in embryonic stem cells and ESCCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

Notably, upon SOX2 KD, all the three active histone marks showed reduced chromatin occupancies, with H4ac showing the greatest reduction (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), consistent with the observation that SOX2 promotes global histone acetylation. Furthermore, among the ChIP-seq peaks showing reduced histone marks, 4,624 (60.3%) H4ac, 6,767 (64.1%) H3K27ac and 6,732 (55.2%) H3K4me3 peaks were directly bound by SOX2 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, upper panels), while the rest peaks showed relatively weaker to non-SOX2 binding (P-value&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> bottom panels), indicating that SOX2 promotes histone acetylation beyond the regions it binds. As histone acetylation is known to promote H3K4 methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, the substantial reduction of H3K4me3 in the SOX2 KD cells could be a consequence of SOX2 on histone acetylation.

Using ROSE algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hpc.nih.gov/apps/ROSE.html">https://hpc.nih.gov/apps/ROSE.html</ext-link>) mainly based on the ranking of H3K27ac intensities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, a well-recognized enhancer marker, we identified a total of 258 SEs in the control K450 cells and 163 SEs in the SOX2 KD cells. Among the 163 SEs identified in the SOX2 KD cells, 128 SEs were also presented in the control cells and 35 SEs were unique to the SOX2 KD cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Notably, although H3K27ac showed comparable levels at the 128 SEs shared between the control and shSOX2 treated cells, the average H4ac level at these SEs was clearly reduced in the SOX2 KD cells, suggesting that the activities of the 128 shared SEs might also be reduced upon SOX2 loss (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>) and H4ac might serve as a more sensitive marker of enhancer activity compared to H3K27ac. We found that the group of gained SEs in SOX2 KD cells showed the lowest SOX2 binding intensities and the group of lost SEs showed a modest level of SOX2 bindings intensities compared to the group of shared SEs in the control K450 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). These results suggest that the shared SEs are more resilient to incomplete SOX2 KD since they exhibit the strongest SOX binding, whereas the lost SEs are modest in SOX2 binding and thus more sensitive to SOX2 dosage. Altogether, the ChIP-seq analyses revealed a crucial role of SOX2 in control of histone acetylation at thousands of the regulatory regions, including most super-enhancers, in ESCC cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Rapid degradation of SOX2 confirms its role in both local and global histone acetylation</title><p id="Par11">The above epigenomic analyses based on SOX2 KD could be complicated by the potential off target effect of shRNAs and/or the potential secondary effect of 2-day SOX2 KD.

The successful knock-in of FLAG-FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> into SOX2 was verified by DNA sequencing and WB results (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) showing an up-shifted SOX2 band with the expected molecular weight that was also overlapped with the band detected by anti-FLAG antibody.

The reduction of H4 acetylation upon 3&#8201;h and 24&#8201;h dTAG treatment was exemplified with keratin family genes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>) and GOLT1B (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). Overall, the average H4ac peak level was reduced upon 3&#8201;h dTAG treatment and further reduced upon 24&#8201;h dTAG treatment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). When average H4 acetylation peaks were sorted by with or without overlapping SOX2 peaks, it is clear that reduction of histone acetylation is more severe at the peaks with SOX2 than that without SOX2 (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h, i</xref>). These results indicate that SOX2 binding promotes local histone acetylation, in agreement with the previous reports that SOX2 can recruit EP300 and other KATs. By ChIP-qPCR analysis, we confirmed SOX2 binding of both KRT6A and KRT5 genes, and this binding was lost upon 3&#8201;h dTAG treatment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3j</xref>), consistent with our WB results that by this time point SOX2 was already effectively degraded. Notably, ChIP-qPCR analysis also revealed that EP300 was associated with both KRT6A and KRT5 genes, and EP300 binding was reduced upon 3&#8201;h dTAG treatment and there was no further reduction of EP300 binding at 24&#8201;h time point (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3k</xref>). Altogether, these results not only confirmed a role of SOX2 in recruitment of EP300 that is likely to contribute to local histone acetylation, but also supported a role of SOX2 in promoting global histone acetylation, because reduction of histone acetylation was also observed at no SOX2 binding regions and further reduction of histone acetylation at 24&#8201;h was observed long after loss of SOX2-dependent local recruitment of EP300 and presumably other KATs as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>SOX2 does not significantly regulate the expression and subcellular localization of acetyl-CoA producing enzymes, glucose and glutamine metabolism, but may slightly promote fatty acid &#946;-oxidation</title><p id="Par13">To investigate how SOX2 enhances global histone acetylation in ESCC cells, we first hypothesized that SOX2 could drive global histone acetylation by promoting the expression of acetyl-CoA producing enzymes.

We found that SOX2 KD slightly reduced the expression of multiple KAT genes, including the major KATs as EP300 (p300), CREBBP (CBP) and KAT7 (HBO1) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6d</xref>). Of note, these KATs were also SOX2 binding targets identified by ChIP-seq, and KAT7 was shown as an example (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). It is noteworthy that SOX2 KD also downregulated the expression of multiple members of HDAC family and SIRT family histone deacetylases (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6e&#8211;g</xref>). We confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis that multiple KAT mRNA levels decreased after SOX2 KD and increased upon ectopic SOX2 over-expression in K30 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f, g</xref>). We validated by WB analysis that SOX2 KD also resulted in reduced protein levels of KAT3A, KAT3B, KAT7 and KAT8, whereas ectopic overexpression of SOX2 had an opposite effect on these KATs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>, left panel). Similarly, we observed that knockout of SOX2 also resulted in a similar reduction of KAT proteins (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>, right panel). Interestingly, although RNA-seq analysis suggested that SOX2 also enhanced HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 expression (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6e, f</xref>), such changes did not alter HDAC1/2/3 protein levels (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>). Together, these results demonstrated a role of SOX2 in global transcription activation, including keratin genes and multiple KATs in ESCCs and suggested that SOX2 may promote histone acetylation in part via its ability to promote multiple KAT expression.

RNA-seq analysis of SOX2 KD in K30 cells also revealed a similar regulation of lipid metabolic genes by SOX2 (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). We next focused on K450 cells since the regulation on lipid metabolic genes is more robust, likely due to a higher level of SOX2 expression than K30 cells. The RNA-seq results were confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b&#8211;d</xref>). This observation raised the possibility that SOX2 may regulate lipid metabolism in ESCC cells. Because fatty acid synthesis or &#946;-oxidation can either consume or produce significant portion of acetyl-CoA, we hypothesized that SOX2 may also indirectly regulate global histone acetylation by controlling fatty acid metabolism. To this end, we examined the level of lipid droplets in control and SOX2 KD K30 and K140 cells by Oil-Red O staining.

Because our stable isotope tracing assay using [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>16</sub>]-palmitate failed to detect significant alteration of fatty acid &#946;-oxidation in SOX2 KD K450 cells (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4e</xref>), we surmised that SOX2 may not significantly affect this pathway despite its regulation of multiple fatty acid &#946;-oxidation related genes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). This could be due to the fact that majority of fatty acid &#946;-oxidation related genes were only slightly downregulated upon SOX2 KD (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). We then focused on whether SOX2 has a role in inhibiting fatty acid anabolism. We noticed that SOX2 KD resulted in significant up-regulation of ACSL5 and ACSL6 and down-regulation of ACSL1, ACSL3 and ACSL4 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). The ACSL family proteins are the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases that catalyze the activation of long-chain fatty acids of 12&#8211;22 carbons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. This reaction is required for channeling fatty acids to either anabolic pathways including the synthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerols (TGs) or catabolic pathway such as &#946;-oxidation. Previous studies indicate that different ACSL family isoforms direct fatty acids to different metabolic fates, with ACSL5 and ACSL6 mainly channeling long-chain acyl-CoA to synthesis of TGs and lipid droplets, ACSL4 to phospholipid biosynthesis, and ACSL1 and ACSL3 to &#946;-oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. We confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis that SOX2 KD led to elevated expression of ACSL5 and ACSL6 and modest reduction of ACSL1 and ACSL3 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). On the contrary, overexpression of SOX2 in K450 cells led to modest increased levels of ACSL1 and ACSL3 mRNAs and marked reduction of ACSL5 and ACSL6 mRNAs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). It is not clear how SOX2 regulates ACSL4 expression, as both SOX2 KD and overexpression led to modest reduction of ACSL4 expression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, d</xref>). These results suggest that by repression of ACSL5 and ACSL6 and activation of ACSL1 and ACSL3, SOX2 could turn fatty acid metabolism from anabolic to catabolic pathway, in agreement with the inverse correlation between SOX2 expression and lipid droplet level we observed in ESCC cells.</p><p id="Par20">To substantiate that SOX2 may enhance histone acetylation by controlling ACSL family gene expression, we focused on ACSL5, because it is the most significantly regulated ACSL gene by SOX2. We first confirmed by WB analysis that SOX2 KD led to increased ACSL5 protein level (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5i</xref>), which could be reversed by ectopic expression of SOX2 in SOX2 KD cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5i</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that ectopic overexpression of ACSL5 was sufficient to significantly elevate lipid droplet level in SOX2-positive K450 cells, whereas ACSL5 KD resulted in marked reduction of lipid droplets in SOX2-negative K410 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref>), highlighting a key role of ACSL5 in controlling lipid droplet level in ESCC cells. Importantly, we observed that knockdown of ACSL5 resulted in substantial increase of histone acetylation in both SOX2-positive K450 cells and SOX2-negative K410 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5k</xref>). In contrast, ectopic overexpression of ACSL5 in various ESCC cells all led to marked down-regulation of histone acetylation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5l</xref>) and non-histone acetylation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5m</xref>). Ectopic overexpression of ACSL5 also slightly down-regulated SOX2 protein level in K30 and K450 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5l</xref>). We suggest this downregulation on SOX2 could be due to reduced histone acetylation by ACSL5 expression. Consistent with this idea, ectopic overexpression of ACSL5 downregulated the expression of multiple SOX2-enhanced keratin gene expression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5n</xref>). Taken together, our study revealed a critical role of SOX2 in regulation of lipid metabolism, particularly lipid anabolism, possibly by repressing ACSL5 expression. Our study also provided evidence that SOX2 may enhance global histone acetylation in part by its ability to inhibit lipid anabolism by repressing ACSL5 expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Lipidomics analysis confirmed a role of SOX2 in lipid metabolism</title><p id="Par21">To independently assess the role of SOX2 in regulation of lipid metabolism, we established an experimental framework to examine the lipid composition in SOX2 overexpression or KD cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.

The most straight forward explanation of these results is that long chain fatty acid activation by ACSL5 (and others) drives fatty acid synthesis/elongation to generate various very long chain fatty acids and TGs, which is in competition with histone acetylation for acetyl-CoA. In support of this idea, we found that inhibition of histone acetylation by C646, a potent CBP/p300 inhibitor, resulted in a marked accumulation of lipid droplets in K30 and K450 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref>). As expected, C646 markedly downregulated histone acetylation as revealed by WB analysis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref>).

We thus investigated if SOX2 controls ESCC tumorigenesis in part by regulation of histone acetylation and ACSL5 expression. To this end, we used K450 cells, which produced tumors in nude mice by subcutaneous transplantation. We validated that knockdown of SOX2 and ectopic overexpression of FLAG-ACSL5 similarly reduced the global level of histone acetylation in K450 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>).

Notably, a 10-year follow up showed that SOX2 expression correlated with better overall survival (HR, 0.710; 95% CI, 0.521-0.967; <italic toggle="yes">p&#8201;</italic>=&#8201;0.028; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8f</xref> and Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Although high SOX2 expression appears to represent a better disease-free survival rate (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8g</xref>), this data lacks statistical significance. When SOX2 and acetylated H4 were analyzed together, we found that both high SOX2 and high acetylated H4 predicts better overall survival (HR, 0.694; 95% CI, 0.538-0.895; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.052; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8h</xref> and Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and disease-free survival (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8i</xref>). Therefore, a positive correlation between SOX2 and histone acetylation was observed in ESCC tumors and, interestingly elevated SOX2 expression and histone acetylation may correlate with a better prognosis.<fig id="Fig8" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><title>SOX2 overexpression correlates with elevated histone acetylation and a better prognosis in ESCC tumors.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Scatter plots of IHC analysis of SOX2 protein levels in tissue microarrays containing normal, hyperplasia, dysplasia and ESCC tumors.

We provide evidence that SOX2 promotes global histone acetylation by promoting local histone acetylation via DNA binding and recruitment of KATs such as EP300, by enhancing the expression of multiple KATs, and by repressing the expression of ACSL5, which diverts acetyl-CoA away from long chain fatty acid synthesis/elongation to histone acetylation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8j</xref>). We showed that ectopic overexpression of ACSL5 resulted in accumulation of lipid droplets, downregulation of histone acetylation, and suppression of ESCC cell proliferation and tumor growth in mouse xenograft models, suggesting that SOX2 promotes ESCC cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in part via reprogramming ESCC lipid metabolism.</p><p id="Par28">We were particularly interested in the molecular mechanisms by which SOX2 functions as a driver of squamous carcinoma. This study was inspired by the report that AKT can promote histone acetylation by stimulating the activity of acetyl-CoA producing enzyme ACLY<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We and others have reported that AKT can stabilize and drive SOX2 overexpression in mouse ES cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, ESCCs and large B lymphoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, raising the question whether AKT also promotes histone acetylation in ESCCs. As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, we surprisingly discovered that SOX2 rather than AKT has a unique role in enhancing global histone acetylation in ESCCs. The ability for SOX2 to drive up histone acetylation is unlikely limited only to ESCCs, as SOX2 also promotes histone acetylation in lung cancer cells (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). The effect of SOX2 on global histone acetylation was further confirmed by our ChIP-seq analysis, which revealed that SOX2 KD and rapid degradation both led to reduction of histone acetylation not only in SOX2-binding regions but also in non SOX2-binding regions (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">Our ChIP-seq analysis also revealed a predominant role of SOX2 binding in promoting local histone acetylation, as the majority of down-regulated H4 acetylation and H3K27ac occurred at the regions with SOX2 binding (4626 SOX2 binding vs 3039 non or weak SOX binding) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> and Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g, h</xref>). Furthermore, our data revealed a critical role of SOX2 in driving the formation of super-enhancers in ESCC cells, as SOX2 binding was observed in most of the super-enhancers (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>) and SOX2 KD impaired about half of the super-enhancers (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f, g</xref>). For example, SOX2 binding is detected in the super-enhancers of multiple keratin gene loci, and keratins represented the most down-regulated genes upon SOX2 KD (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, c</xref>), consistent with its role as an oncogenic determinant of SCCs. This unusual ability to enhance local histone acetylation and super-enhancer formation is likely linked to SOX2 ability to recruit KATs such as CBP/p300 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3k</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">Metabolism rewiring is tightly linked to epigenetic regulation and has been recognized as a hallmark of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Mammalian chromatin contains at least 10 billion potential acetylation sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, implying that a global change in histone acetylation would require rewiring of acetyl-CoA metabolic flux. In the search for molecular mechanism(s) by which SOX2 enhances global histone acetylation in ESCCs, we found that SOX2 regulates neither ACLY, ACSS2 and PDC-E2 expression nor their subcellular localization (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), although we could not rule out the possibility that SOX2 might regulate their enzymatic activities. Metabolic tracing analyses revealed that SOX2 KD did not significantly alter the metabolism of glucose and glutamine and fatty acid &#946;-oxidation (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). However, under palmitate only condition, we did observe that SOX2 KD slightly reduces fatty acid &#946;-oxidation in K450 cells, suggesting that SOX2 may have a minor role in promoting fatty acid &#946;-oxidation (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4i</xref>). Notably, by RNA-seq analysis we uncovered that SOX2 regulates the expression of a large number of fatty acid metabolism-related genes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>), raising the possibility that SOX2 may play a role in regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Along this line, we demonstrated that SOX2 has a critical role in suppressing lipid storage in ESCCs (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e&#8211;i</xref>). As our metabolic tracing experiment suggested that SOX2 did not significantly regulate fatty acid &#946;-oxidation, we focused our attention on whether SOX2 regulates lipid anabolism. We noticed from RNA-seq data and confirmed by RT-PCR analysis that SOX2 markedly represses ACSL5 and ACSL6 and moderately enhances ACSL1, ACSL3 and ACSL4 expression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a&#8211;d</xref>). This observation is intriguing because ACSL5 and ACSL6 are known to more likely channel activated long chain fatty acyl-CoA toward fatty acid synthesis/elongation and lipid storage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, whereas ACSL1, ACSL3 and ACSL4 tend to channel activated fatty acyl-CoA more toward fatty acid &#946;-oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Indeed, we demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of ACSL5 resulted in a simultaneous accumulation of lipids (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref>) and downregulation of global histone acetylation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5l</xref>), whereas ACSL5 KD diminished lipid storage (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref>) and elevated the global histone acetylation level in ESCCs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5k</xref>). How SOX2 represses ACSL5 expression is currently largely unknown, we believe this repression is unlikely direct, because we failed to identify any SOX2 binding peak in the ACSL5 genomic locus (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7c</xref>). It is noteworthy that our lipidomic analysis revealed a profound effect of SOX2 in lipid metabolism, consistent with our RNA-seq data that many lipid metabolic related genes are regulated by SOX2.</p><p id="Par31">Our RNA-seq analysis revealed that SOX2 regulates the expression of a panel of KATs, HDACs and SIRTs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). We confirmed by WB analysis that SOX2 enhanced the protein levels of multiple KATs including KAT3B/p300, KAT3A/CBP and KAT7/HBO1 (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f&#8211;h</xref>), the major KATs involved in histone acetylation. Knockdown of KAT3B/p300, KAT3A/CBP and KAT7/HBO1 could downregulate the global histone acetylation in K450 cells (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6h</xref>), in support that SOX2 could modulate histone acetylation by enhancing their expression. Interestingly, WB analysis showed that SOX2 KD did not significantly affect the protein levels of HDAC1/2/3, the major HDACs responsible for histone deacetylation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>). We have not yet to investigate if altered expression of SIRTs contributes to SOX2-driven histone acetylation, because SIRTs are not the major enzymes for histone deacetylation. Thus, our data favor the idea that SOX2 is likely to drive global histone acetylation in part by its ability to enhance the transcriptional activation of multiple KATs.</p><p id="Par32">We present evidence that SOX2 expression positively correlates histone acetylation in clinical ESCC tumors (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), in agreement with our finding that SOX2 promotes global histone acetylation. BET bromodomain inhibitors, which displace BET proteins such as BRD4 from chromatin by competing with their acetyl-lysine recognition modules, have shown promising efficacy in several models of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. In accordance with the histone hyperacetylation phenotype, we found that SOX2-positive ESCC cells were less sensitive to BET inhibitors than SOX2-negative ESCC cells (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>), suggesting that elevated histone acetylation may render ESCC insensitivity to BET inhibition. Thus, it remains an interesting question for future study whether direct targeting histone acetyltransferase(s) could provide selectively therapeutic efficacy to SOX2 positive ESCCs.</p><p id="Par33">Interestingly, despite of a strong role of SOX2 in promoting ESCC proliferation and graft growth, higher SOX2 expression and histone acetylation appears to correlate with a better clinic prognosis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8f&#8211;i</xref>). A possible explanation is that other subtypes of ESCCs may acquire more aggressive phenotypes through different oncogenic mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. However, it is also plausible that, through the mechanism we report here, SOX2 suppresses long chain fatty acid synthesis and storage, a process that has been implicated in cancer progressiveness and malignancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par34">In sum, our study revealed a role of SOX2 in promoting global histone acetylation and super-enhancer function in ESCCs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8J</xref>). Interestingly, Myc has been previously shown to influence global histone acetylation in part through upregulation of KAT2A/GCN5 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. SOX2 is likely to enhance global histone acetylation in part by promoting KAT expression and by repressing ACSL5 expression, which in turn inhibits long chain fatty acid synthesis/elongation and channels acetyl-CoA to histone acetylation. This unique ability for regulating histone acetylation and lipid metabolism is functionally linked to potent SOX2 transcriptional activity and likely provides an explanation why SOX2 is powerful oncogenic determinant in ESCCs and possibly other tumors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Ethical regulations</title><p id="Par35">All research complies with relevant ethical regulations.

The ChIP-seq peaks of SOX2 in control and SOX2 knockdown cells were called by MACS2 (v2.1.2) with the parameters --fix-bimodal -p 0.05 because SOX2 signals were weak, and the ChIP-seq peaks of H4ac, H3K27ac and H3K4me3 were called with the parameters -B -q 0.01 --nomodel -extsize 150. The differential ChIP-seq peaks were called with -p 1e-7, and further filtered to acquire at least 1.5-fold changed peaks. The genome distribution of SOX2 ChIP-seq peaks was calculated by R package ChIPseeker and plotted by EXCEL. The motifs of SOX2 binding sites were identified by Homer.
