Practice-wise, creating reducing restrictive practice ward champions is indicated, as this study shows that it is possible to increase patient safety when there is a culture leader for restraint reduction in the multidisciplinary team (MDT). Policy should emphasise the drive towards increased psychiatric inpatient safety in the context of well-trained, resourced and supported PICU MDTs, consistently delivering evidence-based restraint reduction interventions.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec sec-type="background" id="s1"><title>Background</title><p> Psychiatric intensive care units (PICUs) are specialist 24-hour inpatient units for individuals experiencing a severe mental health crisis who are sectioned under the Mental Health Act and pose a risk to themselves or others and whose needs cannot be safely managed on an acute psychiatric ward.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> National Association of PICUs<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> (NAPICUs) defined someone requiring PICU admission as having &#8216;significant risk of aggression, absconding with associated risk, suicide or vulnerability (eg, due to sexual disinhibition or over-activity) in the context of a serious mental disorder&#8217;. PICUs are therefore locked and secure wards with access to seclusion rooms and have low patient capacity, high staff to patient ratios and are staffed by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) using a biopsychosocial approach. Restrictive practice on such wards includes use of physical restraint, chemical restraint via rapid tranquilisation and the use of seclusion. The patient experience of these practices is that they are frequently psychologically traumatic or retraumatising,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and this negative experience also extends to staff.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4 5</sup></xref> Both groups are also at risk of physical injury during physical restraints.

The role was developed because of patient and family feedback of their negative experiences of restrictive practices. The RRIA role was therefore intended to increase the patient safety culture on the intervention PICU. New patient and family psychoeducation was developed that was integrated into the admission process and delivered by the RRIA. Each admission was therefore &#8216;co-produced&#8217; with individual patients in terms of how restraints could be effectively managed. On the occasions when restrictive practices were necessary, the RRIA took the lead, modelling the ability to assess the situation, implementing least-restrictive practice approaches and then leading on post-incident debriefs. The PICU also had a weekly reflective practice group led by a consultant clinical psychologist, during which the team would discuss creating and maintaining effective teamwork and a positive ward culture. All staff receive 3&#8201;days of annual mandatory training on restraint reduction by the organisation-wide RRI team on how to manage restraint scenarios in a physically safe manner. The RRIA role was held by a female unqualified member of the MDT who spent 1&#8201;day per week with the RRI team delivering mandatory training. The RRIA therefore linked with the RRI team, bridging the gap between theory and practice. The RRIA had joint clinical supervision every 4&#8211;6 weeks from the PICU ward manager and the RRI team lead.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Psychiatric intensive care units</title><p>The intervention PICU was an adult, mixed-gender inpatient psychiatric ward with five beds, a seclusion room and an attached section 136 suite. It was staffed by an MDT of medics, qualified and unqualified nurses, an occupational therapist and a clinical psychologist. A comparison and matched mixed-gender six-bedded PICU was recruited within the same organisation but on a different site. The staff mix was the same on the control PICU.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Design</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Quality improvement</title><p>This is a novel approach to using a time series methodology in two PICUs (ie, one intervention PICU and one control PICU) to evaluate the effectiveness of a restraint-reduction intervention. This met the criteria for being a quality improvement (QI) approach as it &#8216;aims to improve patient safety, effectiveness and experience of care by: (a) using understanding of our complex healthcare environment and (b) applying a systematic approach&#8217;.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Using a time-series approach enabled the observation of longitudinal changes to ward restrictive practice trends.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The impact of the intervention was anticipated not to be immediate and therefore long time-series (ie, 19&#8201;months pre intervention and post intervention) were deemed necessary. Under the remit of a QI design, the initiative required both &#8216;thinking&#8217; and &#8216;doing&#8217; aspects. The thinking aspect contained two parts: (a) recognising that restraint was being frequently used and having the motivation to reduce this and (b) identifying appropriate outcome measures. The doing aspect consisted of implementing a &#8216;plan-do-study-act&#8217; cycle, summarised as: (a) planning, the ward manager and RRI lead discussing the restraint vision for the PICU, (b) do, the recruitment and training of the RRIA (c) study, the design of the evaluation, registration and ethical approval and collection of the data and (d) act, the analysis of the data and feedback to the ward team and wider organisation. Outcomes on the intervention and control PICUs were evaluated using a biphasic time series design (ie, a 19-month preintervention baseline phase &#8216;A&#8217; vs the 19-month postintervention phase &#8216;B&#8217; on each PICU). <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Online supplemental table 1</xref> defines the primary and secondary outcome variables.

Semistructured interviews were conducted with the RRIA, the ward manager on the intervention PICU and the RRI lead. These 30-minute interviews were conducted with the &#8216;change interview&#8217;, a semi structured interview which identifies changes created by an intervention.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> This approach takes a sceptical approach to evaluating change, does not assume that changes reported are the direct result of the intervention being evaluated and therefore considers the likelihood of the change occurring without the intervention or due to the influence of other factors.

Visual analysis of the restraint outcome trends included phase changes in central tendency, level, trend, variability, latency and overall patterns.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Effectiveness was assessed with non-overlap statistics, including the percentage of data points exceeding the median (PEM)<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref>; and non-overlap of all pairs (NAP)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>. Non-overlap statistics assess the degree to which outcomes during an intervention phase overlap with the same outcomes in the baseline phase. For example, if seclusion was being regularly used during the baseline phase and irregularly used during the intervention phase, then there would be a high degree of non-overlap, and this would indicate an effective intervention. Where there is a large overlap, this shows an ineffective intervention. Effect-size descriptors for these non-overlap statistics are as follows: &lt;50% ineffective intervention, 50&#8211;69%&#8201;debatably effective intervention, 70&#8211;89%&#8201;moderately effective intervention and &gt;90% as indicative of a very effective intervention.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Kendall&#8217;s Tau (&#964;) statistics was used to identify the presence of a within-phase linear trend and provide an effect-size estimate, while also adjusting for the baseline trend.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> &#964;U<sup>AvsB</sup> assessed whether there was a statistically significant reduction in restraint between the phases, while &#964;U<sup>(AvsB)- trend A</sup> performed the same evaluation while adjusting for any significant trends in the baseline phases.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Non-overlap statistics were produced using <italic toggle="yes">SingleCaseES</italic> (V.0.7.2.9999<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref>). &#932;au was calculated using the Baseline Corrected Tau Web Calculator<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and time series plots were developed using Microsoft Excel.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Descriptive analysis</title><p><xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> reports the total frequency, mean and SD for restraint outcomes in each phase on each PICU.

of an organisational intervention to increase patient safety on a PICU. The positive impact of the RRIA role was indexed&#8212;(a) quantitatively, in terms of reductions to restraint compared with baseline (and in comparison to the control PICU) and (b) qualitatively, through staff reporting key changes to the ward safety culture. The common theme across the interviews was a change led by the RRIA in patient:staff relational dynamics, in which the least restrictive ward culture meant that restraint was the last and not the first option. This involved more use of de-escalation skills, requiring staff to work more psychologically and less physically with patients at risk of harming themselves or others. These findings would align with the CQC<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> call for PICU care to be more person-centred and less control centred. Rather than an instantaneous change in outcomes, there was evidence of a slowly decreasing pattern of restraint on the intervention PICU, and this is consistent with the pace of culture change interventions. The RRIA had an active coaching role in the MDT and such roles need the close support and commitment of ward managers. This active behavioural coaching approach fits with the recent National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> call for QI coaches to reduce restrictive practices on wards.

However, greater usage was evident on the intervention ward.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Outcome 5: frequency of standing holds in interventions</title><p>The RRIA role saw a significant reduction in standing holds during restraint incidents. This is demonstrative of a culture shift towards a more &#8216;hands-off&#8217; patient risk management approach. Taken alongside the findings of less implementation of full restraint (see the Outcome 3 section), this offers reciprocal support for the RRIA role effecting a positive safety cultural change in the MDT.</p><p>In terms of guidance around patient safety, the &#8216;Safewards&#8217; model is the most commonly used.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> However, a scoping review<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> found that while Safewards enabled positive patient safety ward cultures to emerge, the approach did not enable reductions to restrictive practice,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> with no significant change to the number of incidents reported.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Safewards therefore appears useful in terms of changing staff attitudes but appears less effective in changing staff behaviours. Both are required to increase patient safety. The current evaluation found significant reductions to the way incidents were responded to and managed on the intervention PICU, and this does index changes to staff behaviour. The RRIA role has three key components. First, it enables changes to staff behavioural responses to distressed patients through active coaching of less restrictive responding and the active leadership during restraints themselves when necessary. Second, it changes staff attitudes to restraint and the team dynamics around restraint.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Third, by &#8216;co-producing&#8217; with each patient on admission how restraints needed to be handled by the team, this created more patient-centred care. It is worth noting that the person in the RRIA role was already a member of the PICU and this likely mitigated resistance to change in the MDT. Close links with the RRI team were helpful and the RRIA role is non-specialist and low-cost. There needs to be an organisational commitment to reducing restraint.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The PICUs were not randomly allocated to intervention or control ward. It is acknowledged that changes to restraint rates are proxy measures for changes to restraint culture and there were factors that could not be fully controlled for, including staff retention and change over time. While a direct effect between change to ward practice/culture and reduced restraint is evidenced here, this may indeed be bi-directional in that reduced use of restraint also changes the ward culture. In clinical practice on a PICU, this would be a virtuous circle. Use of seclusion on PICUs has been found to be significantly associated with any ongoing damage to the ward environment and patient violence; the measurement of these factors is important in future studies.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Other unmeasured factors influencing use of restraint include the mental state of patients on admission and the PICU physical environments; these were not measured or compared in the current study. There is evidence that ward design features (eg, more total private space per patient) decrease the use of seclusion.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> It is acknowledged that the intervention ward had more consistent staffing and the control PICU did use more temporary/agency staff. It is worth noting that the PICUs operated within the same organisation and so patients were, on occasion, transferred between the PICUs, but staff were not. The evaluation was reliant on the quality of information entered onto IRF documentation. Data were not collected in terms of patient diagnosis, symptom severity, symptom chronicity and current medication, and all these factors may have interacted with the restraint outcomes. This project followed on from previous work that had identified relevant predictive staff, patient and context factors for restraint being used<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> and wanted to shift to reducing restraint. There is a risk of measurement bias in an intervention study such as this in terms of deciding and selecting how and what outcomes to evaluate, how to measure these outcomes, the overall design of the evaluation and the consequential prioritisation of particular outcomes. There is also the risk of the &#8216;mere measurement effect&#8217;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> whereby simply measuring restraint causes changes to restraint practice. This may account for some of the changes on the control PICU. It is hoped these potential sources of bias were mitigated by the experimental design, use of precollected restraint outcomes and the data analysis being conducted independently from the clinical teams. Evaluation work is complex nevertheless and carries the risk of creating unintended positive and negative consequences<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> that then can be falsely attributed to the intervention. Further controlled restraint intervention evaluations on PICUs should integrate into their methods the assessment of potential unintended outcomes, try to avoid creating negative unintended outcomes and also be able to account for and explain positive and negative unintended outcomes when they occur.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Future research and practical recommendations</title><p>Regarding the sustainability of the intervention, the RRIA was formally established as part of the funding model for the PICU; the team recognised the importance of a collaborative relationship between the RRI team, ward manager and RRIA in facilitating and sustaining this (please refer to <xref rid="SP11" ref-type="supplementary-material">onlinesupplemental material </xref><xref rid="SP7" ref-type="supplementary-material"> figures 6, 7</xref><xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">undefined</xref>). It is acknowledged that the &#8216;intervention&#8217; was the role of the RRIA and so this needs to be a team member with the relevant skills, experience and interpersonal characteristics (including assertiveness) to enable positive and consistent change to ward restraint culture. Given the core responsibility of the RRIA role, it is important to recognise that as the culture change began to occur on the intervention PICU, our data illustrated maintained change even during periods of RRIA annual leave and sickness leave. Therefore, despite the challenges and logistics of individual working patterns, the implementation of the RRIA role was still influencing restraint practices on the intervention PICU. The RRIA role was established as a pilot, with organisational commitment required to support the wider implementation of this across other mental health acute and PICU wards.</p><p>Future research may seek to more directly measure the staff and patient experience through established measures, such as the Ward Atmosphere Scale<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> and more qualitative interviewing. Intervention evaluations should also collect contemporaneous information on patient diagnoses and medications and more information on staff demographics and staffing levels. Staff turnover and rates of staff physical and psychological trauma could be potential outcome measures in future research. Co-production with patients and carers of interventions to reduce restraint would be a valuable contribution to the methods of future studies. This raises the possibility of randomising patients to personalised versus generic restraint reduction interventions in future studies. More use of randomisation to safety culture interventions would be useful generally. It is probable (on the basis of the current evidence) that the RRIA role is likely to be beneficial; a stepped-wedge RCT would also be a candidate future methodology. Due to the slow nature of organisational cultural change, extended follow-up periods are needed. Where evaluation focuses on single wards, then the A/B design used in the current study could be improved by the addition of a withdrawal and reintroduction phase to form an A/B/A/B design.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> This design could therefore also be used where real-world working practices have changed. There is an assumption that research on PICUs is particularly difficult to achieve due to the complexity of the patients,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> but this project illustrates that it is possible. The development and testing of conceptual models of restraint that take account of context, patient and staff factors will be useful.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This project has been the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a safety culture change intervention on a PICU and was achieved through comparing restrictive practices over time against a control PICU and interviewing of key staff members. The project supports the effectiveness of having an RRIA in psychiatric inpatient ward settings that have a behavioural coaching and leadership brief. Qualitatively, there was a shift towards better teamwork around the consideration of whether restraint was needed, consistent application of de-escalation strategies and an increase in staff confidence. The RRIA role therefore emerges as a key cultural lever in the drive to reduce restrictive practices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary
