Owing to the absence of pathognomonic symptoms or imaging hallmarks, the malignancy is frequently obscured by coexistent renal calculi, hydronephrosis, or infection, resulting in formidable diagnostic challenges, missed diagnoses, and consequently delayed treatment. We report a 60-year-old man who presented with HSK, left renal calculi, and hydronephrosis. After comprehensive preoperative evaluation, laparoscopic radical nephrectomy with isthmic transection was performed; histopathology confirmed a moderately to well-differentiated RSCC. A systematic literature review contextualizes this exceptional association. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for RSCC in HSK patients with long-standing calculi or anatomical anomalies who present with refractory flank pain. Early radical nephrectomy with regional lymphadenectomy remains the treatment of choice. Immunotherapy holds promise, yet its efficacy requires validation in prospective studies. </p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Horseshoe kidney</kwd><kwd>Renal parenchymal squamous cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>Immunotherepy</kwd><kwd>Kidney stones</kwd><kwd>Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Science and Technology Fund Project of Guizhou Provincial Health Commission of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>gzwkj2025-063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Zunyi Municipal Science and Technology Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>Zunshi Kehe HZ [2024] 189</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Horseshoe kidney (HSK) is a common type of congenital malformation in renal syndesmosis. Its prevalence in the general population is about 0.25%, and males are more susceptible to this malformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Primary renal parenchymal squamous cell carcinoma (RSCC) is an extremely rare tumor that is difficult to diagnose by hematology and imaging studies and is often diagnosed later than other primary renal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This article reports a case of horseshoe kidney combined with renal parenchymal squamous cell carcinoma. The combination of the two rare cases brings great challenges to urologists in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Case presentation</title><p id="Par3">A 53-year-old man presented with left lumbar pain for 4 months, no significant hematuria, and no significant weight loss. Examination at a local county hospital revealed horseshoe kidney and left kidney stones with hydronephrosis, for which he was treated in our hospital.</p><p id="Par4">After admission, the CT scan of urinary system showed horseshoe kidney, multiple stones and severe hydronephrosis in the left kidney, which was suspected to be complicated with inflammatory lesions. Right renal cyst, left renal artery stenosis. Renal scintigraphy (functional imaging) showed no blood perfusion in the left kidney, which was non-functional, and abnormal morphology of the right kidney, decreased blood perfusion, and obstructed excretion. Hemoglobin was 87&#160;g/L, platelet 62&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8313;/L, and creatinine 124&#181;mol/L. Other examinations were unremarkable.</p><p id="Par5">

</p><p id="Par6">According to the examination results at that time, we only judged that the patient was horseshoe kidney with left kidney stones and severe hydronephrosis. Considering that the patient&#8217;s left kidney was not functional, we optimized the patient&#8217;s hemoglobin and platelet levels, and then performed transabdominal laparoscopic left nephrectomy&#8201;+&#8201;horseshoe kidney isthmus disconnection. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was renal parenchymal squamous cell carcinoma (moderately to well-differentiated), and the ureter and vascular stumps were not involved. Immunohistochemistry results: HER2 (1+), PD-L1 (CPS 60%; positive control +; negative control -; clone number: 22C3A). Note: CPS 60% indicates that among every 100 tumor cells, the total number of PD-L1&#8211;positive tumor cells and immune cells is 60.</p><p id="Par7">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par10">Horseshoe kidney is a common congenital renal anomaly, characterized by the connection of bilateral kidneys through a bridging tissue, typically located in the lower abdomen anterior to the spine. This anatomical abnormality can lead to complications such as urinary tract obstruction, kidney stones, infections, and renal insufficiency. Recent studies have shown that patients with horseshoe kidneys are at a higher risk of developing urological malignancies compared to the general population, particularly renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and urothelial carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, reports of horseshoe kidney combined with renal parenchymal squamous cell carcinoma (RSCC) are relatively rare, and the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma as a variant of renal parenchymal malignancy remains incompletely understood. Renal parenchymal squamous cell carcinoma presents additional challenges in horseshoe kidney patients, including diagnostic difficulties and complex treatment strategies.</p><p id="Par11">Renal squamous cell carcinoma is an uncommon renal malignancy, representing about 0.5&#8211;1% of all malignant renal tumors. Its histological origin remains a subject of debate, with some scholars suggesting it originates from the transitional epithelium of the renal pelvis and ureter, while others propose that it arises from renal parenchymal cells. However, current guidelines do not clearly specify whether squamous cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis and renal parenchyma should be classified as RSCC. It often presents with insidious onset and lacks specific clinical and imaging features. It is currently believed to be associated with chronic inflammation, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and is linked to long-term irritation of the urothelium. Patients with horseshoe kidney, due to structural and functional abnormalities of the urinary system, are prone to local chronic inflammation and infection, creating a potential microenvironment conducive to the development of renal parenchymal squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Preoperative diagnosis of renal squamous cell carcinoma based solely on symptoms, signs, and imaging findings is challenging, and biopsy is often not feasible due to the location of renal squamous cell carcinoma. Clinical misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is common, potentially delaying treatment. Therefore, in patients with long-standing kidney stones, pyonephrosis, or renal anatomical abnormalities, especially those presenting with symptoms such as severe, unrelieved flank pain, vomiting, poor appetite, and weight loss, the possibility of renal squamous cell carcinoma should be considered. The case presented here illustrates a patient with severe flank pain that could not be effectively alleviated.</p><p id="Par12">Cases of horseshoe kidney combined with renal parenchymal squamous cell carcinoma (RSCC) are relatively rare. The clinical manifestations of horseshoe kidney combined with RSCC are often non-specific. Common symptoms may include flank pain, hematuria, and recurrent urinary tract infections, which are often confused with the underlying pathological changes of the horseshoe kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], making early diagnosis challenging. RSCC typically presents as a large mass, sometimes accompanied by renal insufficiency or hydronephrosis. Imaging studies, such as CT, MRI, and ultrasound, play a crucial role in early detection of renal tumors, but the imaging characteristics of RSCC are not typical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. RSCC may resemble other types of renal cancer or kidney infections, so diagnosis often depends on histological examination. The pathological features of RSCC include the presence of squamous characteristics and keratin pearl formation within the tumor tissue. The diagnosis of RSCC relies on immunohistochemical staining markers such as CK7, CK20, and P63 to distinguish it from other types of renal tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Due to the rarity of renal parenchymal squamous cell carcinoma (RSCC), there are no established treatment standards or prognostic data. Compared with other upper urinary tract malignancies, RSCC is more aggressive, presenting as high-grade tumors with poor prognosis. Currently, the treatment of RSCC remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Traditionally, RSCC shows poor sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and due to its locally invasive nature, surgical resection remains the primary treatment modality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Radical surgery is the preferred treatment for primary RSCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The proximal ureter, perirenal tissues, and lymph nodes are often involved, and efforts should be made to remove these tissues during surgery. Whether distal ureterectomy or bladder cuff resection and renal hilar lymph node dissection are necessary depends on the tumor&#8217;s location and extent, as well as the presence of urinary tract obstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In horseshoe kidney patients with renal stones and RSCC, urinary tract obstruction often leads to hydronephrosis, increasing renal pelvic lymphatic reflux and lymph node metastasis. In such cases, radical nephrectomy, renal hilar lymph node dissection, and total ureterectomy should be considered. However, due to the unique biological behavior of RSCC, the prognosis for these patients is generally poor. For horseshoe kidney patients, preoperative assessment of renal function is especially important, as the surgery may involve partial or total nephrectomy.</p><p id="Par14">In recent years, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (such as PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors) and targeted therapies (such as VEGF inhibitors) in renal cell carcinoma has made significant progress. Studies have shown that combined radiation therapy with 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy can prolong survival in patients with advanced renal squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], but results with platinum-based chemotherapy have not significantly extended survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Immunotherapy has been rarely reported in the treatment of renal squamous cell carcinoma. In theory, renal squamous cell carcinoma is considered a tumor with a high mutational burden, making it a promising candidate for immunotherapy. By using PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway can be effectively blocked, thereby reversing the suppressed T-cell function. This intervention helps enhance the body&#8217;s anti-tumor immune response, not only enhancing the anti-tumor immune response in cancer patients but also promoting the generation of lasting immune effects, potentially extending patient survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. According to a case report by West China Hospital of Sichuan University, immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy showed preliminary efficacy in advanced renal squamous cell carcinoma, with single-agent PD-1 therapy maintaining disease stability after achievement of remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, there is still insufficient evidence to support the widespread use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies in the treatment of renal parenchymal squamous cell carcinoma. As a result, clinical treatment of horseshoe kidney patients with renal parenchymal squamous cell carcinoma often involves personalized treatment strategies, taking into account factors such as renal function status, tumor staging, and molecular characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par15">This case report highlights the challenges in diagnosing and treating horseshoe kidney with renal parenchymal squamous cell carcinoma. The combination of these two rare conditions presents significant difficulties in early detection and management. Our comprehensive review of the literature suggests that early diagnosis and surgical intervention are crucial for improving patient outcomes. However, due to the rarity of this condition, further research is needed to establish standardized treatment protocols. If patients show poor sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, with unsatisfactory efficacy, consideration should be given to immunotherapies such as PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in the hope of achieving better outcomes.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par16">This study has several limitations. First, the sample size is small, which limits the generalizability of our findings. Second, the retrospective nature of the study means that some data may be incomplete or subject to bias. Third, the lack of long-term follow-up data prevents us from making definitive conclusions about the long-term outcomes of the treatment. Future studies should aim to address these limitations by including larger cohorts and conducting prospective, longitudinal analyses.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Peng Su and Ying Yang contributed equally </p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Peng Su and Ying Yang are the co-first authors, and Hong Zheng and Neng Zhang are the co-corresponding authors.
