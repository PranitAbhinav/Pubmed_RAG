This negligence leads to environmental pollution, water contamination, and adverse health effects in developing urban areas. The 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle) are fundamental principle in solid waste management. They aim to minimize waste by decreasing resource consumption (reduce), encouraging the repeated use of items (reuse), and transforming waste into new products or energy (recycle). Therefore, this study aims to evaluate domestic solid waste management practices and their determining factors in Bule Hora town.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 361 households of Bule Hora Town. Study participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. Data was collected by using a pre-tested questionnaire and an observational checklist. The collected data was entered into EpiData version 4.6.1 and subsequently exported to SPSS version 26 for statistical analysis. Logistic regression analysis with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was employed to identify factors associated with domestic solid waste management practices. Variables with a p-value of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The domestic solid waste management practices in Bule Hora town were found to be inadequate, with a rating of only 66.7%. This deficiency can be attributed primarily to poor institutional conditions (77.3%), insufficient funding support for solid waste management initiatives from the municipality (84.4%), and inadequate collection services (74.5%). Approximately two-thirds of respondents (67.6%) indicated that the city does not implement safe and reliable solid waste management practices to meet the needs of residents. The study participants revealed that larger families are more likely to engage in poor solid waste management practices compared to smaller families (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]&#8201;=&#8201;4.35; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.73&#8211;6.97; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.001). Additionally, households with low average incomes were found to be 6.63 times more likely to practice poor solid waste management than those with higher incomes (AOR&#8201;=&#8201;6.63; 95% CI 4.01&#8211;10.98; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">This study showed that, the domestic solid waste management system in Bule Hora town is inadequate. We recommend that the town implement community awareness programs and enhance municipal solid waste collection services. Additionally, homeowners should focus on reducing waste volume through reuse, recycling, and energy recovery initiatives.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12889-025-24391-8.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Solid waste management</kwd><kwd>Challenges</kwd><kwd>Determinants</kwd><kwd>Waste disposal</kwd><kwd>Bule Hora town</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par10">Solid waste management is defined as the process of controlling the generation, storage, collection, transfer or transport, treatment, and disposal of waste in ways that effectively address public health, environmental pollution, the impact on aquatic life, economic factors, and aesthetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Municipal solid waste consists of domestic, institutional, industrial, and commercial waste, with industrial waste often containing hazardous materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Domestic solid waste management refers to the waste generated from households, which involves storage, collection, segregation, transportation, treatment, and disposal system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Globally, rapid urbanization and population growth are accelerating the generation of solid waste, which poses significant challenges for effective waste management. Estimates indicate that annual waste generation is expected to rise to 2.2&#160;billion tons by 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].The 3Rs (reuse, reduce, and recycle) solid waste management system aims to minimize waste generation by promoting the separation of recyclables for reuse, recycling non-degradable items, and ensuring that non-recyclable waste is either landfilled, incinerated, or composted. Improper solid waste disposal near water bodies releases pollutants, adversely affecting water quality and potentially leading to health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Non-biodegradable waste, particularly plastics, poses a serious threat to biodiversity and the stability of ecosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Urbanization significantly influences the development of solid waste production; however, the methods for collection, disposal, and dumping remain complex in African cities, particularly in Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Inadequate waste management in low-income countries results in the improper disposal of over 50% of collected waste, leading to environmental pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].These issues are further exacerbated by population growth, rapid urbanization, and evolving waste management practices. In developing countries, only 30&#8211;50% of solid waste is collected and managed appropriately, while the remainder is either burned or left to decompose in open space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Solid waste management presents significant challenges in developing countries, including Ethiopia, where 67% of waste is organic and only 5% is recycled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This situation poses health, environmental, and aquatic threats, especially in urban areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In Addis Ababa, it has been reported that only 20&#8211;30% of generated waste is being managed properly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Studies conducted in towns within Ethiopia&#8217;s Oromia region, such as Asella, Fiche, Laga Tefo, Shashamane, Jimma, and Metu, reveal significant deficiencies in solid waste management. These inadequacies contribute to environmental pollution and health risks due to shortcomings in sorting, collection, transportation, and disposal systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In Bule Hora town, waste management practices, including open disposal near rivers and roadsides, as well as open burning is leading to health issues and aesthetic degradation. Moreover, there is a lack of research on solid domestic waste management practices and the factors influencing them in Bule Hora town. This study aims to evaluate domestic solid waste management practices, and the determining factors involved. The findings will address the existing knowledge gap and may provide valuable insights for the municipality in addressing solid waste management challenges. Additionally, this research will enhance the understanding of the effectiveness of solid waste management, including collection, transportation, and disposal, thereby assisting local government.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3582"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Description of the study area</title><p id="Par13">The study was conducted in Bule Hora Town, the administrative center of the West Guji Zone in the Oromia regional state, Ethiopia (see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The town is located 467&#160;km south of Addis Ababa, positioned between 5&#176;35&#8242; and 5&#176;63&#8242; N latitude and 38&#176;15&#8242; and 38&#176; longitude, at an altitude of 1,893&#160;m above sea level. It serves as a hub for the Addis Ababa-Moyale highway in the Borena Zone of the Oromia Region. The population of the town is alarmingly increasing, with a total population projection of 57,700 and approximately 6,507 households. Meteorological data indicates that Bule Hora Town falls under the Woina Dega climatic zone, with a mean annual temperature range of 15&#160;&#176;C to 20&#160;&#176;C and an average annual precipitation of 900 to 1100&#160;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In Bule Hora town, solid waste management is inadequate, as there are no properly designed disposal sites, minimal door-to-door collection services, and no vehicles for waste disposal. Almost all households dispose of their solid waste on open surfaces, along roadsides, and in streams. The most common disposal method in the town is open dumping.</p><p id="Par14">

Photographs were taken during the field observations to document dumping sites and the community&#8217;s illegal solid waste management practices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Solid waste composition</title><p id="Par39">Solid waste composition refers to the different types of solid waste and the quantities of components that constitute the entire solid waste stream. Accordingly, data on daily waste composition were collected from each selected household for seven consecutive days. Each household was given a plastic bag labeled with the corresponding house number to store the daily solid waste generated. Similarly, another plastic bag labeled with the same house number was provided to each household for the following day&#8217;s collection, and this process continued until the last day of data collection. Every morning, the collected waste was brought to the strategically selected working site. Finally, after collecting the waste, the researcher sorted the components of solid waste, weighed them, and recorded the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par63">Municipal solid waste management is a critical problem in developing countries, including Ethiopia, where only 2% of the population has access to services for collection, transportation, and disposal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This study was conducted to evaluate domestic solid waste management and the factors contributing to effective waste management in the town. The challenges affecting solid waste management identified in this study include inadequate collection services, a lack of infrastructure (such as waste collection trucks and disposal sites), poor disposal practices, insufficient public awareness, geographical factors (such as the scattered settlement of households), and weak institutional and financial support. These findings are consistent with a study conducted in Shashamane city, which revealed that various challenges hinder integrated solid waste management, including an inadequate budget for waste collectors and limited municipal waste collection capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This study revealed that (28.5%) of respondents in the town practice solid waste segregation at the household level, while the rest did not (71.5%). This finding is higher than those from studies conducted in Asella, Benishangul Gumuz, Chiro town, Dire Dawa, Yebu town, and Uganda, which reported (27.2%), (23.6%), (26.4%), 22.9%), (26.9%) and (59.4%), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, it is lower than the study conducted in Woldia, which reported that 35.2% of households segregate waste at the source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">Reuse and recycling require waste segregation; however, sorting waste by type at the source by household owners presents challenges in solid waste management. Several factors may contribute to this issue, including the commitment of household owners, sample size, socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents, and lifestyle choices. The study found that approximately two-thirds of the respondents (66.7%) engage in poor solid waste management practices in the town. These improper practices pose significant public health risks, including vector-borne diseases (such as malaria and dengue), respiratory illnesses, and waterborne diseases (such as cholera and typhoid) resulting from contaminated water, blocked drainage systems, and soil degradation. Solid waste collectors are also at risk of injuries and infections, which hinders progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). Effective waste management procedures can reduce disease transmission and improve the quality of water and the environment. This finding is supported by various studies in developing countries, including Ethiopia, Uganda (58.7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], Ghana (82.7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], Gondar (69.7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], Nigeria (83.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], Debre Berhan (75%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and Tanzania (62%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The differences in waste management practices can be attributed to variations in lifestyle, socio-demographic factors, community awareness regarding solid waste management, and policy implementation.</p><p id="Par65">In this study, various types of solid waste were generated by households in the town, including food residue (31.6%), paper and cardboard (26.9%), plastics (17.4%), metals and electronics (7.7%), textiles (4.8%), and other materials (11.6%). All of the aforementioned waste was poorly managed in the town, posing a threat to public health and causing environmental contamination of surface water, soil, and air. This finding is supported by studies conducted in various towns in Ethiopia, such as Bahir Dar, Asella, and Metu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, a study conducted in Sulaimania City, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, revealed that only a small percentage (15.7%) of household waste was disposed of as waste, while the remainder was reused or recycled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This discrepancy may be attributed to differences in the commitment of household owners, lifestyle choices, socio-demographic factors, and infrastructure.</p><p id="Par66">The study identified several factors significantly associated with solid waste management practices, including family size, average monthly income, education level, access to door-to-door collection services, and participation in reuse and recycling programs. In this study, only 25.5% of households in the town had access to door-to-door collection services. This low rate can be attributed to limited municipal resources, the absence of waste collection trucks, a lack of community awareness, and insufficient communal disposal containers. Consequently, the inadequate door-to-door solid waste collection services in the town contribute to poor solid waste management practices. This issue can be addressed by increasing the budget for waste collection, actively engaging the community, collaborating with private waste collectors, and implementing effective policies. The findings revealed that households with access to door-to-door solid waste collection services were approximately four times more likely to practice proper solid waste management than those without such services (AOR&#8201;=&#8201;3.67, 95% CI: 2.24&#8211;6.04).</p><p id="Par67">The finding regarding the effectiveness of door-to-door collection services is supported by a study conducted in Asella and Fiche towns, which reported that individuals with such services exhibited practices that were four times better and 3.5 times better, respectively, than those without them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, this finding is lower than that of a study conducted in Addis Ababa, where 84% of residents had access to door-to-door collection services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Possible explanations for this discrepancy include differences in lifestyle, varying levels of community awareness, economic activities, the willingness of households to pay for waste collection, and the presence of stringent rules and regulations related to solid waste management in the city.</p><p id="Par68">In this study, 29.6% of the participants reported practicing the reuse and recycling of generated solid waste. This finding is higher than the findings from studies conducted in Fiche (17.4%), Asella (10.7%), Gondar (2.43%), and Jimma (26.3%), and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Conversely, this finding is lower than that of a study conducted in Bahir Dar (44.7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A possible explanation for this discrepancy may be due to varying levels of awareness and understanding of the importance of reuse and recycling practices among communities. Additionally, factors such as the legal framework, the enforcement of regulations, the involvement of various NGOs in promoting community awareness, and the sample size may also contribute to these variations.</p><p id="Par69">The current study found that households with good knowledge of the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) were approximately six times more likely to engage in effective solid waste management compared to their counterparts (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]&#8201;=&#8201;5.62, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 3.28&#8211;9.63). This finding is supported by study conducted in Fiche town revealed that a significant association between the 3Rs and proper solid waste management practices (AOR&#8201;=&#8201;6.61; 95% CI: 2.94&#8211;14.87) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

Households with a high average monthly income practice effective solid waste management approximately seven times more than low-income households (AOR&#8201;=&#8201;6.63, 95% CI: 4.01&#8211;10.98). This finding is supported by a study conducted in Laga Tefo town, which revealed that as the average monthly income of a household increases, the likelihood of properly managing solid waste also increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, it was found that higher-income households contribute more to solid waste management efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p id="Par70">While this study has provided valuable insights, it also has limitations, including self-reported data bias, seasonal variations, and a cross-sectional design, which limits both causality and generalizability.

This study identified several challenges, including the lack of door-to-door collection services, insufficient institutional and financial support for solid waste collectors, inadequate disposal methods, and a lack of commitment from both the community and municipal authorities. These factors hindered effective solid waste management in the town. Furthermore, only a small percentage (22.7%) of participants reported favorable institutional conditions for solid waste management practices. The town administration is enhancing municipal funding for waste collection, implementing 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) training programs, and establishing community-based waste management committees. Additionally, the municipality should promote and encourage the participation of household owners and support small-scale entrepreneurs in waste collection to improve solid waste management (SWM) practices, such as reducing disease burden and enhancing environmental quality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
