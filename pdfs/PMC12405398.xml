Given the complexity of thalamic surgery, selecting an optimal surgical approach demands an accurate three-dimensional understanding of relevant structures.

From a surgical perspective, the complexity of the region is further compounded by its deep location, which significantly restricts access, thus rendering it a high-risk region for surgical intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Moreover, from a topographical standpoint, the thalamus lies adjacent to several highly eloquent telencephalic, diencephalic and mesencephalic structures. The thalamus is also characterized by a highly variable vascular supply most commonly coming from deep perforating branches of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and the posterior communicating artery (PCoA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This variability makes the consequences of arterial injury largely unpredictable, ranging from minor to highly devastating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Venous drainage also shows marked anatomical variability and is primarily provided by tributaries of the internal cerebral vein and the basal vein of Rosenthal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].
</p><p id="Par22"> Nevertheless, micro-surgical removal of thalamic tumors is a feasible treatment option, with documented satisfactory outcomes. Adequate neuroanatomical knowledge and microsurgical technique are essential for determining the most appropriate surgical approach, and for its successful planning and execution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].
</p><p id="Par23">Of the various steps involved in surgically treating a thalamic lesion, choosing and planning the surgical approach plays a much more important role than it does in other types of surgery, as outlined above. The surgeon is required to a) make an accurate topographical diagnosis of the lesion and b) accurately conceptualize it in three dimensions, along with the surrounding anatomy, so as to be able to c) choose the most suitable surgical approach. This step is arguably pivotal in the training of every neurosurgeon, particularly in relation to the learning curve of complex surgical procedures.</p><p id="Par24"> Until recently, the choice and planning of surgical approaches primarily relied on conventional two-dimensional (2D) imaging. While this approach may provide sufficient information for an experienced neurosurgeon on a routine surgical case, it may not be sufficient for neurosurgeons confronted with a rare or unusual lesion, such as a thalamic or other deeply located lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A precise and accurate three-dimensional representation of the patient's anatomy can facilitate informed decision-making and surgical planning, enhancing the surgeon's confidence during operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].
</p><p id="Par25"> The digitalization of the medical field has led to significant advancements in imaging modalities, including the emergence of augmented reality (AR) and, more specifically, mixed reality (MR). By combining real-world visual perception with virtual, interactive holographic projections, MxR enables surgeons to manipulate and interact with 3D reconstructions of patient-specific anatomy derived from preoperative imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Three-dimensional interactive holographic models allow neurosurgeons at all levels of experience to examine complex relationships between the tumor, and adjacent brain structures from multiple perspectives before the surgery. Unlike conventional 2D imaging, MxR supports a more intuitive understanding of spatial configurations, enhancing the surgeon&#8217;s ability to anticipate challenges, plan precise trajectories and minimize brain retraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, MxR may represent a great perioperative adjuvant to the microsurgical technique, particularly in such complex cases as those related to thalamic surgery.
</p><p id="Par26">This study presents an analysis of a single-center, single-operator series of thalamic tumor resections supported by preoperative MxR visualization technology. The analysis aims to demonstrate the usefulness of MxR in this context and provide insight into its integration with established microsurgical techniques.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical data</title><p id="Par27"> A retrospective analysis was conducted using prospectively collected data on patients who underwent surgical procedures for a thalamic lesion at our institution between 2022 and 2024 with the support of mixed reality (MxR). All patients were operated by a single surgeon (C.S.). All patients had preoperative and early postoperative (less than 48 h) 3 T brain magnetic resonance imaging. Volumetric measurements were performed on manual or semi-automatic tumor segmentations in the 3D slicer software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Extent of resection (EOR) was evaluated by comparing preoperative and postoperative volumetry as commonly described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. An EOR of greater than 99% was defined as a Gross Total Resection (GTR), while a Near-Total Resection (NTR) was classified as an EOR between 99 and 95%, and a Subtotal Resection (STR) was defined as an EOR of less than 95%. All patients underwent thorough neurological examination at admission, postoperatively (&lt;&#8201;6 h postoperative), at discharge, and at the three-month postoperative control. The follow-up period and postoperative treatment was contingent upon the histopathology of the lesion. New-onset postoperative neurological deficits were considered permanent when present at the three-month postoperative follow-up. Descriptive statistics were employed to report patients'data. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. This study was made in accordance with the ethical standards set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the institutional review committee.
</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Surgical planning with mixed reality system</title><p id="Par28"> All lesions were approached through the so-called &#8216;free thalamic surface&#8217;, defined as the portion of the thalamus that borders cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces, making it accessible via purely transcisternal (TCi) or transcallosal-transventricular (TCTV) surgical corridors. This enables surgical access while minimizing manipulation of otherwise healthy cortical and white matter structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. For surgical purposes, the thalamic free surface can be further subdivided according to clearly recognizable anatomical landmarks into four surfaces: the velar surface, the third ventricle surface, the lateral ventricle surface and the cisternal surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] (Fig. 
<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These anatomical landmarks are clearly recognizable even on standard neuroimaging and therefore allow the identification of the free thalamic surface closest to the tumor. Each of these surfaces can be reached with one or more TCi/TCTV approaches. The final choice also depends on other concomitant factors, the most important of them being the relation of the tumor with the splenium of the corpus callosum and with the deep venous system of the transverse fissure, as well as the presence of CSF circulation disturbances as previously detailed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The need for 3 T-ioMR may also play a role. It is difficult to provide an algorithmic guide for the approach to individual surfaces since each case can present unique variations. In general, it can be said that the
<italic toggle="yes">lateral ventricle surface</italic> should be approached preferentially with an anterior interhemispheric transcallosal (AIT) approach, particularly in cases of concomitant hydrocephalus. Similarly, the
<italic toggle="yes">velar surface</italic> can be approached preferentially via an AIT approach, especially if the choroidal fissure has already been opened up by the growing tumor. The
<italic toggle="yes">third ventricle surface</italic> can be approached either through the foramen of Monro after an AIT approach, as in the case of concomitant hydrocephalus, or posteriorly, with a perimedian contralateral supracerebellar suprapineal approach (PeCSS). The cisternal surface can be approached in two ways: either via a posterior interhemispheric transtentorial approach (PITS) if splenic and venous anatomy allows for it, or via a perimedian supracerebellar transtentorial approach (PeST).
<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Holographic representation of the free thalamic surfaces and relevant anatomical landmarks. The appearance of the holograms (upper panel) is compared to that of the thalamic surfaces on a specimen (lower panel) to highlight the models'fidelity in neuroanatomical topography. Red indicates the velar surface; purple, the third ventricle surface; light blue, the cisternal surface; and yellow, the lateral ventricle surface. The lateral ventricle surface is located between the stria terminalis, laterally, and the taenia choroidea, medially. The margins of the third ventricle surface are defined by the stria medullaris thalami, on its superior and on most of its anterior and posterior borders. The remainder of the posterior border is defined, in a cranial-to-caudal direction, by the habenular commissure, the pineal recess, and the posterior commissure. The hypothalamic sulcus demarcates the inferior border. The cisternal surface corresponds to the part of the pulvinar medial to the fimbria and medial and lateral geniculate bodies. The lateral border is defined by the taenia choroidea. Superomedially, the cisternal surface continues into the velar surface above the habenular commissure. Below the habenular commissure, the medial border continues in the lateral margin of the pineal recess and the posterior commissure. The velar surface is located between the taenia choroidea and the stria medullaris thalami. The stria terminalis is represented in white; the fornix in green; and the stria medullaris in orange. The tenia choroidea is not represented as the fornix serves, also is the microsurgical view, as a landmark for its course.

The following structures were segmented for each case: tumor, fornix, choroid plexus, stria terminalis, stria medullaris thalami, ventricles, corpus callosum, deep venous system, brain, and cerebellum. Segmentation was performed using a combination of automated and, when necessary, manual or semi-automated techniques. Automated segmentation was performed using a validated mesh-based algorithm (Disior) integrated within the cloud-based Lumi platform (Augmedit BV, Naarden, The Netherlands) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which enabled rapid model generation from DICOM files. In cases where the quality of the generated model was deemed insufficient, or when segmenting small and anatomically complex structures not covered by the algorithm, manual or semi-automatic segmentation was carried out using 3D Slicer (version 5.6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Larger structures such as ventricles or tumors, when not accurately segmented automatically, were segmented semi-automatically using the &#8220;Grow from Seeds&#8221; module. Thin tubular structures, such as the stria terminalis and stria medullaris thalami, were segmented manually using the &#8220;Draw Tube&#8221; module from the SegmentEditorExtraEffects extension. Final 3D models were uploaded to the Lumi platform and visualized perioperatively using mixed reality glasses (HoloLens 2, Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA) (Fig.

The anatomical relationships between the tumor and the four free thalamic surfaces are studied in detail, as are the relationships between the tumor and the other anatomical structures previously mentioned. These relationships are examined in both general terms and in terms specific to each individual approach. Each approach can then be simulated in an immersive way, allowing the pros and cons to be evaluated. Then, the best approach is chosen based on the MxR simulation.</p><p id="Par31">Finally, in the operating room, a manual registration between the hologram and the patient's head is performed during the non-sterile intraoperative phase after head fixation using reliable surface landmarks (nasion, inion, and tragus). The correctness of the hologram-head matching is then verified by means of standard navigation. Any modification of the patients/head positioning is noted. Intraoperative hologram visualization allows for adjustment of the patient's position to achieve optimal surgical angles. This is particularly important for deep surgical corridors, such as those required for thalamic surgery. Once the patient has been positioned, the skin incision can be adapted with the assistance of direct 3D visualization of the deep target and surrounding structures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Results</title><p id="Par32"> A total of 10 surgical procedures for the removal of a thalamic lesion were performed on 9 patients (M:F&#8201;=&#8201;4:5) with a mean age of 48 years (range 22&#8211;73) during the study period. The goal was to achieve the maximum safe resection. Details of clinical presentation are reported in Table 
<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Two of the lesions were metastases, one was a low-grade glioma, and the remaining six were high-grade gliomas, two of which exhibited a H3 mutation. One patient had previously undergone a stereotactic biopsy, while one other patient underwent two surgical procedures for cytoreduction during the same hospitalization. The first procedure was performed in an emergency setting to lower intracranial pressure, and the second was for oncological purposes. An AIT approach was selected for 8 surgical procedures; in the remaining 2 cases a PeST approach was chosen.

However, all patients who had a 3-month postoperative neurological examination demonstrated an improvement, with two patients exhibiting complete resolution. Overall, one patient exhibited a new-onset, permanent, mild hemiparesis as a consequence of surgery. In a single case, there was a three-month postoperative worsening of hemiparesis in a patient who did not present with any new-onset postoperative neurological deficits. This was indicative of an early tumor recurrence of a WHO grade IV glioma. As with the neurological deficits, the mean KPS decreased at discharge (74 at admission to 71), but showed a recovery at the 3-month follow-up (75). There was one mortality only, related to one young patient presenting in coma with bilateral mydriasis who underwent emergent surgery. Unluckily he never recovered from coma and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral midbrain infarction possibly due to acute herniation by tumor compression. Death occurred in the fourth postoperative day. One patient died before the 3-month follow-up control because of an early recurrence. One patient experienced a medical complication: a CSF infection with subsequent epidural abscess formation and drug-induced hepatopathy secondary to antibiotic treatment. This underwent further surgical procedures for abscess evacuation and operculum removal and, six months later, for a custom-made cranioplasty. There were no infection-related new-onset neurological deficits. Four patients underwent a total of 6 procedures for CSF diversion. Three patients underwent external ventriculostomy and one endoscopic third ventriculostomy (3VC), all prior to thalamic surgery to relieve intracranial hypertension due to tumor-related obstructive hydrocephalus. In one case a 3VC was performed at the end of tumor removal through an AIT approach. In all cases, hydrocephalus was resolved by the time of hospital discharge.

This dynamic is exemplified by the lateral displacement of the plexus. This indicates that the tumor has grown upward from the velar surface, reaching the lateral ventricle. The tumor's location in the cella media of the lateral ventricle, when combined with the presence of radiological evidence of hydrocephalus, facilitates its accessibility via AIT. The histological and molecular report indicated a diffuse high-grade glioma, not elsewhere classified (NEC).

During the procedure, the patient's head was carefully repositioned from a lateral to a neutral stance between the two surgical phases. The selection of the AIT approach based solely on two-dimensional imaging is not straightforward due to the absence of hydrocephalus. However, MxR simulation provides reassurance to the surgeon when choosing AIT by demonstrating how the tumor emerges at the lateral ventricular surface of the thalamus. Additionally, it allows for the simulation and confirmation of the angle of approach to the tumor. The total removal of both lesions was successfully achieved.

This finding underscores their value in diagnosing the topography of thalamic tumors in relation to thalamic surfaces. It also demonstrates their effectiveness in conceptualization, which effectively becomes a three-dimensional visualization of these tumors in relation to the surrounding anatomical structures. Furthermore, MxR tools can be used to simulate and validate the most suitable surgical approach. We believe that these advantages can help shorten surgical learning curves and, together with the essential principles of microneurosurgery, make these surgical approaches accessible to a wider audience of neurosurgeons and, therefore, patients.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Thalamic surgery</title><p id="Par47"> The surgical outcomes in this series, showing a mean extent of resection (EOR) of 94.88% and GTR achieved in two-thirds of cases, align with recent literature about thalamic tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The low rate of permanent complications (1 out of 9 cases) at 3-months postoperative follow-up and the recovery of preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) in most patients reflect the safety, and thus feasibility, of such treatment option. In accordance with microneurosurgical principles, we exclusively employ transcisternal approaches, which provide direct access to the free surfaces of the thalamus while minimizing disruption to healthy cortical and subcortical structures. Although robust empirical data demonstrating superior outcomes compared to transcortical approaches remains to be published, rational analysis suggests that avoiding unnecessary damage to healthy brain tissue is a sensible choice to reduce the risk of postoperative morbidity. Our results appear to support this rationale. Obstructive hydrocephalus is a critical factor in the management of thalamic tumors, given its frequent presentation in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

Traditional methods of surgical planning, primarily relying on 2D imaging sequences, provide essential information but lack the ability to intuitively convey intricate 3D spatial relationships. Interestingly, the importance of a more realistic visualization of the surgical anatomy was already acknowledged by Professor Ya&#351;argil, who used to flip side to side radiological images and even turn them upside down in order to visualize the correct lateralization and mimic the intraoperative angle of view. MxR, using patient-specific holograms, represents a transformative advancement in neurosurgical planning by addressing these limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One of the most significant advantages of MxR is the interactive 3D visualization of patient-specific anatomy. MxR, providing a tangible holographic representation of the tumor and surrounding structures, reduces the cognitive burden associated with mentally transforming data from standard 2D imaging into 3D spatial awareness. This allows the surgeon to focus more effectively on the surgical plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, the implementation of 3D visualization tools has the potential to reduce the learning curve and increase the number of surgeons who are able to perform even the most complex cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

To date, the main limitation to the implementation of MxR methods in neurosurgery has always been the prolonged time required for preoperative image processing and segmentation, which is often incompatible with clinical routine.
</p><p id="Par51"> Indeed, at approximately 45 min, the average processing time in our series could be considered excessive and unjustified, even considering the expected benefits of MxR methods in terms of anatomical understanding and surgical planning. However, in our opinion, the situation changes when MxR is applied to more complex surgeries, such as thalamic surgery. In this case, the anatomical and planning complexities can be discouraging. In fact, most neurosurgeons are still discouraged by it to the point that they often consider such lesions inoperable, despite several authors postulating the feasibility of such surgery in the 1980&#8201;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].
</p><p id="Par52"> As with other highly complex surgeries, the scientific community faces the issue of reproducibility in thalamic surgery, which certainly decreases as complexity increases. One response may be to declare a condition inoperable or more suitably treatable by other methods. However, one could also argue for simplifying the most effective treatments or training more surgeons to perform them, regardless of their complexity. Regarding gliomas, there is definitive evidence that EOR significantly correlates with oncological outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, any technological or scientific advance that allows the concept of maximal safe resection to be extended to the widest possible number of patients should be welcomed. This includes patients with lesions in highly critical regions. Considering this, we deem the additional 45 min required for preoperative image processing in our study a reasonable investment.

However, the very aim of this study is to underscore the potential of MxR to improve the spatial understanding of deep-seated neuroanatomical structures and to support structured preoperative planning and mental rehearsal. By facilitating these processes, MxR could improve accessibility to such complex surgeries and promote their integration into broader neurosurgical practice.</p><p id="Par54">The lack of a control group limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the added clinical value of MxR. Future studies including appropriate comparisons will be needed to better clarify its role.</p><p id="Par55">Beyond these study-specific aspects, the implementation of MxR in the neurosurgical workflow is not without limitations. First, segmentation accuracy may vary depending on imaging quality and anatomical complexity, particularly for small or low-contrast structures. While this may affect visual fidelity, it is important to emphasize that the primary purpose of MxR planning is to provide a macroscopic and qualitative spatial understanding of tumor topography relative to key anatomical landmarks. In this context, manual refinements can often be limited or omitted when not essential for surgical planning, thereby reducing workload and improving efficiency. Second, MxR integration entails a learning curve, both in segmentation workflows and intraoperative interpretation; however, in our experience, this is not particularly steep, and once familiarized with the process, the advantages clearly outweigh the initial effort. Finally, although commercial platforms may involve licensing fees and specific hardware (e.g., HoloLens headsets), the growing availability of open-source imaging tools such as 3D Slicer and the decreasing cost of MxR head-mounted displays (HMDs) suggest that this technology may soon complement conventional navigation systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par56">This study represents the first application of MxR technology in the surgical workflow of thalamic microneurosurgery. Moreover, it highlights the potential of 3D MxR interactive visualization to provide neurosurgeons with a more precise preoperative surgical planning, rehearsal, patient positioning, and skin incision planning, thus supporting microsurgical technique, especially in highly demanding surgeries such as those involving thalamic tumors.</p><p id="Par57">The present analysis supports the safety of microsurgical removal of thalamic lesions, with an acceptable level of morbidity. In our view, maximal safe microsurgical resection should be pursued even in such challenging locations, and every technical adjunct that may facilitate this goal deserves to be explored. Technologies such as MxR may contribute to making these procedures more accessible and reproducible. Future studies should quantitatively assess how MxR can enhance the safety and extent of tumor resection and promote its integration into routine surgical workflows.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
