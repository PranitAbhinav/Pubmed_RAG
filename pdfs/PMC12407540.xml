RAB23 is a small GTPase known to regulate the Hedgehog signalling pathway and ciliary trafficking. Mutations of <italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> in humans lead to Carpenter syndrome (CS), an autosomal recessive disorder clinically characterized by craniosynostosis, polysyndactyly, skeletal defects, obesity, and intellectual disability. Although the clinical features of CS bear some resemblance to those of ciliopathies, the exact relationship between the pathological manifestations of CS and the ciliary function of <italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> remains ambiguous. Besides, the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> ciliary functions of <italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> remain poorly characterised. Here, we demonstrate <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro Rab23</italic> loss-of-function mutants modelling CS, including <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> conditional knockout (CKO) mouse mutants, CS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and zebrafish morphants. The <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic>-CKO mutants exhibit multiple developmental and phenotypical traits recapitulating the clinical features of human ciliopathies and CS, indicating a causal link between the loss of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> and ciliopathy. In line with the ciliopathy-like phenotypes, all three different vertebrate mutant models consistently show a perturbation of primary cilia formation, intriguingly, in a context-dependent manner. <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic>-CKO mutants reveal cell-type specific ciliary abnormalities in chondrocytes, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, neural progenitor cells and neocortical neurons, but not in epithelial cells, cerebellar granule cells and hippocampus neurons. A profound reduction in ciliation frequency was observed specifically in neurons differentiated from CS patient iPSCs, whereas the patients&#8217; fibroblasts, iPSCs and neural progenitor cells maintained normal ciliation percentages but shortened cilia length. Furthermore, <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic>-KO neural progenitor cells show perturbed ciliation and desensitized to primary cilium-dependent activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings indicate that the absence of <italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> causes dysfunctional primary cilia in a cell-type distinctive manner, which underlies the pathological manifestations of CS. Our findings present the first <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> evidence validating the unique context-specific function of <italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> in the primary cilium. Through the use of patient-derived iPSCs differentiated cells, we present direct evidence of primary cilia anomalies in CS, thereby confirming CS as a ciliopathy disorder.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p><italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> mutations lead to Carpenter syndrome (CS), which manifests multiple clinical features resembling those of ciliopathies, a spectrum of disorders caused by defective primary cilia.

In humans, dysfunction of the primary cilium results in a range of rare multisystemic congenital disorders that are collectively known as ciliopathies [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Notably, ciliopathy disorders often exhibit overlapping phenotypes albeit genetically distinct. For example, Bardet&#8211;Biedl (BBS) and Joubert (JBTS) syndromes are ciliopathies caused by different gene mutations but share multiple common phenotypes such as retinal degeneration, cerebellar malformation and cognitive impairment, polycystic kidneys, and polydactyly [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Carpenter syndrome (CS) is a pleiotropic autosomal recessive genetic disorder often reported in patients carrying biallelic pathogenic variants in <italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The disorder is typically characterized by craniosynostosis, finger and toe deformity (such as polydactyly, brachydactyly, and syndactyly), visual and hearing impairments, short stature, obesity, and mild to severe intellectual disability. Other variable clinical presentations observed in CS patients include heart defects, molar agenesis, hypogenitalism, genu valgum and hydrocephaly [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Notably, numerous common clinical features of CS patients are overlapping with the common clinical hallmarks of ciliopathies, such as polysyndactyly, hydrocephaly, obesity, and intellectual disability. Despite these clinical similarities and recent speculations on the association between <italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> and ciliopathy [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], it remains unclear whether patients with CS exhibit defective primary cilia.</p><p>Rab23 is a member of the small GTPase family whose GDP-GTP exchange activity is promoted by its Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) complex, composed of Inturned (Intu) and Fuzzy (Fuz) [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In mouse null mutant models, Rab23 was found to negatively regulate the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The Shh signaling pathway is predominantly regulated in a primary cilium-dependent manner. In this process, the presence of Shh ligands induces Smoothened (Smo) to translocate to the primary cilium axoneme, which subsequently initiates the downstream signaling cascade through Gli transcription factors [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> has been shown to mediate the ciliary localisation of Smo, Dopamine receptor 1 (D1R), and Kif17 [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the roles of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> in primary cilia biogenesis and/or maintenance remain ambiguous and controversial. Independent groups have reported inconsistent results on the effect of siRNA-directed silencing of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> in mouse inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD3) cells. While Gerondopoulos et. al observed a reduced degree of ciliation, Leaf and von Zastrow reported an unperturbed extent of ciliation in <italic toggle="yes">Rab23-</italic>knockdown IMCD3 cells [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A similar discrepancy was also observed in the immortalized retinal pigmented epithelial (hTERT-RPE1) cell line. Two independent groups have reported a reduced ciliation [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], whereas another study observed no discernible change in the percentage of ciliation, despite using the same siRNA-mediated knockdown approach to silence <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> in hTERT-RPE1 cells [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, in our previous study on <italic toggle="yes">Rab23-</italic>knockout cerebellar primary granule progenitor cells culture [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we observed a reduction in the length of primary cilia, albeit with an unperturbed rate of ciliation. Given these inconsistent observations on the effect of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> silencing on the primary cilia formation and its structural integrity, more extensive investigations are necessary to elucidate the precise functions of Rab23 within the primary cilium.</p><p>In this study, we have established novel disease models of Carpenter syndrome using transgenic mice and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) reprogrammed from biopsies of Carpenter syndrome patients. Strikingly, both the global gene knockout (KO) mutants (actin-Cre), and neural progenitor cells (NPCs)-specific knockout mutants of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> display a range of developmental and phenotypic abnormalities that largely resemble the clinical features observed in Carpenter syndrome and ciliopathy patients. In these mutants, a significantly reduced number of primary cilia were observed in the cerebral neocortical neurons, NPCs, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), suggesting that Rab23 plays important ciliary functions in the neocortical neurons, NPCs, and MEFs. Intriguingly, the frequency of ciliated cells appeared largely unchanged in other brain regions such as the hippocampus neurons and granule precursor cells in the cerebellum, or in other non-neuronal cell types such as the epithelial cells and chondrocytes. However, <italic toggle="yes">Rab23-</italic>KO NPCs, cortical neurons, and chondrocytes show shortened cilia length. In <italic toggle="yes">rab23</italic>-silenced zebrafish morphant (<italic toggle="yes">rab23</italic> MO), the frequency of ciliation in the neural progenitor cells was predominantly perturbed in the rostral neural tube but not in other regions such as the more caudally located spinal cord neural tube nor the pronephric duct.

In summary, the collective results from various animal and cellular disease models indicate that tissue- and cell-type-specific dysfunctions of primary cilia could contribute to the pathological features of Carpenter syndrome, implying that Carpenter syndrome is a ciliopathy disorder.

To address this, we overexpressed wild-type full-length Rab23, constitutively active (GTP-bound) form of Rab23, i.e., Rab23Q68L, and dominant negative (GDP-bound) form of Rab23, i.e., Rab23S23N in wild-type NPCs, respectively. The <italic toggle="yes">Gli1</italic> expression levels were then measured and compared between these overexpression groups. The data showed that the overexpression of Rab23Q68L in wild-type mouse cortical NPCs led to a decrease in the expression of <italic toggle="yes">Gli1</italic>.

These results indicate that Rab23 modulates Shh signaling activity through its classical GTP/GDP cycling-dependent functions, presumably involving its specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and GTPase-activating protein (GAP).</p><p>We further analyzed both ciliation percentage and cilia length (<xref rid="pgen.1011611.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1011611.g006" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>) while investigating Rab23 overexpression effects on Hedgehog signaling. Overexpression of Rab23WT in wild-type NPCs showed no significant changes in ciliation prevalence or cilia length compared to controls. Whereas, the constitutively active Rab23QL form maintained normal ciliation prevalence but displayed significantly longer cilia relative to both controls and the Rab23SN inactive group. Conversely, overexpression of the constitutively inactive Rab23SN mutant resulted in significantly shorter cilia and reduced ciliation frequency compared to both vector controls and Rab23QL-expressing NPCs (<xref rid="pgen.1011611.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1011611.g006" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Interestingly, these findings reveal opposing trends between cilia morphology and Hedgehog signaling activity following Rab23 overexpression, with constitutively active Rab23QL increasing cilia length while decreasing Hh signaling, and inactive Rab23SN producing shorter cilia with elevated Hh pathway activity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec009"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study underscores the critical and evolutionarily conserved functions of <italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> in preserving morphologically intact and functional primary cilia across various vertebrates, including the zebrafish, mice, and humans, notably in a cell type distinctive manner (<xref rid="pgen.1011611.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). This study unveils that conditional knockout mouse mutants of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> exhibit a spectrum of phenotypic and pathological traits reminiscent of the classical clinical features reported in both Carpenter syndrome and ciliopathy disorders in humans. Consistent with the phenotypic association with ciliopathy, examination of primary cilia in both tissue sections and primary culture samples from E18.5 and adult <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> conditional KO mice revealed profound ciliary anomalies in selective mature neuronal populations; and relatively moderate yet statistically significant ciliary perturbations in embryonic fibroblasts, cortical neural progenitor cells, cortical intermediate progenitor neurons, and chondrocytes.

These results further suggest that dysfunctional primary cilia, to some extent, may underlie the pathological presentation of Carpenter syndrome.</p><fig position="float" id="pgen.1011611.g007" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1011611.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of the conserved functions of Rab23 in primary cilia.</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> exerts evolutionarily conserved and context-specific functions in maintaining morphologically intact and functional primary cilia.

However, as far as our current knowledge extends, there remains a lack of direct evidence substantiating the causal link between <italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> mutation and Carpenter syndrome with ciliopathy. Our data reveals for the first time that Carpenter syndrome patients carrying the biallelic <italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> p.(L145*) variant exhibit variable degrees of primary cilia anomalies in their tissue samples-derived iPSCs, iPSC-differentiated neurons, neural progenitor cells and fibroblasts. Notably, the most severe ciliary defects was observed in iPSC-differentiated neurons, which showed a drastically reduced ciliation percentage, while patients&#8217; iPSCs, hNPCs and fibroblasts exhibited shortened cilia length despite unchanged primary cilia prevalence. Importantly, our collective results show that different vertebrate models of <italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> loss-of-function mutants consistently presented with several pathological phenotypes and cellular characteristics typical of human ciliopathies. Our work thus provides compelling and direct evidence demonstrating that <italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> mutation is clinically linked to ciliopathy, further validating the classification of Carpenter syndrome as one of the disorders within the ciliopathy spectrum.</p><p>Intriguingly, <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> deficiency differentially perturbs primary cilium morphology in a cell type-specific manner, with particularly pronounced effects on certain neuronal populations. This cell-type-specific phenomenon was consistently observed in both <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> mouse and zebrafish models, as well as the Carpenter syndrome patient-derived cells. Importantly, our findings on the context-dependent ciliary function of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> help to explain the discrepancies previously noted in independent studies where primary cilium defects were reported in some experimental models but not in others [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To examine the structural damage and/or the loss of primary cilia, multiple primary cilium markers were employed for cilia examinations in this study. For example, ciliary membrane markers including ARL13B and AC3, along with the ciliary microtubule marker, Acetylated-&#945;-tubulin, were utilized to visualize the primary cilia axoneme in different cell and tissue samples. Specifically, ARL13B and Acetylated-&#945;-tubulin were used simultaneously to examine primary cilia in multiple cell types, including human iPSCs, MEFs, human dermal fibroblasts, and neocortical intermediate progenitor neurons <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. Our results demonstrate that Acetylated-&#945;-tubulin co-expresses with ARL13B along the ciliary axoneme in both control and <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> loss-of-function groups across these cell types. While these results confirm the shortening of primary cilia and disrupted ciliogenesis in these cells-types, they do not rule out the possibility that loss of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> functions could lead to cell-type-specific reduced expression levels of ciliary membrane markers and other ciliary proteins along the axoneme. Notably, in fibroblasts, the results revealed unexpected differences in the ciliary phenotypes between the mouse and human disease models. <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic>-KO MEFs exhibited a significantly reduced ciliation percentage without discernible changes in cilia length. In contrast, Carpenter syndrome (CS) patient fibroblasts showed milder ciliary defects, maintaining normal primary cilia prevalence but displaying shortened primary cilia. We reason that these phenotypic inconsistency could be due to differences in the characteristics and tissue origins of the two fibroblast cultures. Specifically, the patient fibroblasts were derived from dermal tissue, whereas the <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic>-KO fibroblasts were embryonic fibroblasts originated from embryonic mesoderm.</p><p>By scrutinizing the time-dependent changes in cilia prevalence and elongation in primary cortical neuron cultures, our findings strongly suggest pivotal roles of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> in primary cilium formation and elongation processes in neuron. In agreement with the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> observations in E18.5 neocortical intermediate progenitor neurons and adult neocortical neurons, primary cortical neurons cultured from <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic>-KO mutant displayed relatively milder cilia phenotype disruptions during early culture stages, with more pronounced and severe ciliary perturbations emerging later in more mature neurons. This evidence clearly demonstrates that <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> plays significant roles in primary cilium formation and elongation processes. In addition, our data appears to align with previous study in hTERT-RPE1 cells where Rab23 and its GEF complex were found to act at an intermediate to late stage of cilium formation [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that current evidence remains insufficient to exclude or define potential additional functions of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> in cilium maintenance or resorption, thus warrants further investigations.</p><p>Previous findings reported that the <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">-/-</italic></sup> null mutant displayed morphologically normal primary cilia in early embryonic stages, including the Arl13b+ primary cilia in E8.5 mesoderm, and nodal cilia at the 0&#8211;1, 3&#8211;4, and 5&#8211;6 somite stages [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Notably, previous studies did not investigate the ciliary functions of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> at later developmental stages because the <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">-/-</italic></sup> null mutant embryos in the C3Heb/FeJ background did not survive beyond E13.5 [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Here, we employed a Cre-loxp transgenic knockout approach, i.e., using actin-Cre to drive the global deletion; and Nestin-Cre for neural progenitor cells-specific deletion of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> in the C57/BL6 background. These approaches have extended the viability of the mutants up to postnatal day 0 and the adult stage, respectively, allowing us to delineate the important ciliary functions of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> during late developmental and adult stages.</p><p>In these mutant mice, our results indicate that <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> plays a pivotal ciliary function in the neocortical region but not in the hippocampal neurons. A notable decrease in ciliation prevalence was observed in both the Tbr1-expressing postmitotic neurons of the neocortex at late embryonic stages and in the NeuN-expressing mature neocortical projection neurons at adult stages. These findings unveil a previously underappreciated function of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> in the adult central nervous system. Consistent with this finding, neurological-associated disorders such as intellectual disability and schizophrenia have been reported in cases of Carpenter syndrome [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our earlier work also revealed the requirement of <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> in modulating the migration of neocortical projection neurons during embryonic brain development [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Given these apparent correlations, further investigations to understand the molecular and cellular roles of Rab23 in neuronal development and neuronal pathophysiology are warranted.</p><p>In a similar vein, a previous study in the zebrafish model showed that morpholino-induced <italic toggle="yes">rab23</italic> knockdown morphants exhibited morphologically normal cilia in Kupffer&#8217;s vesicle at the 8-somite stage, albeit with disrupted left-right patterning [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In our current investigation, we delved deeper to examine primary cilia in several tissue regions of <italic toggle="yes">rab23</italic> zebrafish morphants at a later embryonic stage, specifically at 24 hours post-fertilization. Our findings revealed a significant disturbances in the cilia quantity, with reduced acetylated-&#945;-tubulin+ primary cilia on neural progenitor cells and motile cilia on ependymal cells, both lining the ventricular lumen of the forebrain neural tube. Conversely, cilia in other regions such as the pronephric duct and spinal cord neural tube appeared normal and were indistinguishable from the control counterpart.</p><p>We further demonstrate that Rab23 exerts GDP/GTP-binding dependent regulation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway in the neural progenitor cells. Compared to the control and the wild-type Rab23 overexpression group, the neural progenitor cells overexpressing the GTP-bound constitutively active form of Rab23 exhibit further inactivation of the Hh signaling pathway, whereas overexpression of the GDP-bound constitutively inactive mutant of Rab23 leads to the ectopic activation of the Hh signaling pathway. These results indicate that the classical Rab GTPase properties of Rab23, including its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and the GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-dependent on/off actions, are essential for dynamically modulating the Hh signaling pathway in neural progenitor cells.</p><p>Strikingly, the variable and relatively mild primary cilia abnormalities in our <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic>-KO mutants differ markedly from the severe ciliogenesis defects observed in the Rab23&#8217;s GEF complex mutants, Inturned-/- and Fuzzy-/- [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which lack functional Rab23 GEF complexes. This phenotypic discrepancy potentially suggests that Intu/Fuz regulate ciliary functions through mechanisms that extend beyond their GEF activity toward Rab23. These observations imply that Intu/Fuz complexes likely possess Rab23-independent roles in ciliogenesis. Furthermore, Intu and Fuz have been demonstrated to modulate Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, with loss-of-function mutants showing downregulated pathway activity &#8211; a trend opposite to that caused by <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> deletion [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This functional antagonism further supports the existence of Rab23-independent mechanisms through which Intu/Fuz regulate Hh signaling.</p><p>Interestingly, our data in cortical NPCs reveals opposing trends between cilia morphology and Hh signaling activity following the overexpression of Rab23 active and inactive mutants. Rab23 activation with the constitutively active Rab23QL expression elongates cilia length while inhibiting Hh signaling pathway. In contrary, inactive Rab23SN reduces cilia prevalence and produces shorter cilia, yet elevates the Hh pathway activity compared to controls. Given that loss of primary cilia typically impedes Hh pathway activation [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], yet this is not the case in the <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic>-deficient cells, in which the Hh signaling pathway is elevated despite disrupted ciliation. Given that previous work has demonstrated that Rab23 negatively affects Hh signaling pathway by binding to Suppressor-of-fused (SUFU) to prevent nuclear translocation of Gli1 transcription factor, a cilia-independent process [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We hypothesise that a similar mechanism could possibly explain the current observations in the mouse NPCs. Specifically, Rab23 may inhibit the Hh signaling pathway by acting on Gli1 transcription factor at the cytoplasmic level, independently of primary cilium. Nonetheless, this propose mechanism warrants further investigation.</p><p>Consistent with our previous findings in <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic>-KO granule cell precursors, where we demonstrated that Rab23 promotes SAG-induced Smoothened localization to the ciliary axoneme, revealing a cilia-dependent mechanism of action [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], our current findings demonstrate that Rab23 exerts multi-dimensional regulatory effects on Hedgehog signaling activity in NPCs. It positively influences the pathway through promoting primary cilia-dependent Smo-mediated Hh signal transduction. This is demonstrated by the finding that <italic toggle="yes">Rab23</italic> loss-of-function both prevents ligand-dependent Hh pathway activation and impairs ciliogenesis (<xref rid="pgen.1011611.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1011611.g006" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>). Additionally, Rab23 also negatively affects Hh signaling activity, potentially by influencing Gli transcription factors in the cytoplasm through impeding the nuclear translocation of Gli1 [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This is further evidenced in our current work, whereby the active form Rab23QL expression suppresses Hh signaling pathway despite normal primary cilium prevalence, and in contrast, Rab23 deficiency causes over-activation of Hh signaling pathway (<xref rid="pgen.1011611.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1011611.g006" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1011611.g006" ref-type="fig">6F</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1011611.g006" ref-type="fig">6G</xref>). This further indicates that different tissues and cell types may respond differently to the loss of Rab23 in terms of Hedgehog signaling activity, whereby Rab23-ablated cells without primary cilia may show partial activation of Hedgehog signaling due to the diminished primary cilia-dependent signaling response, whereas those with intact primary cilia may exhibit ectopic activation of the pathway. These findings suggest that Rab23 plays critical roles in modulating a context-dependent differential regulation of Hedgehog signaling pathway.</p><p>It&#8217;s worthy to note that Carpenter syndrome presents a distinct phenotypic spectrum compared to other ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Alstr&#214;m syndrome. Based on our data, it&#8217;s plausible that this unique phenotypic spectrum may be attributed to the context-specific ciliary roles of Rab23, as well as the ciliary-independent regulatory functions of Rab23 on cell migration and other developmental signalling pathway such as the FGF, ERK and nodal signaling pathways [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For instance, it was reported that Rab23 influences FGFR and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in osteogenesis [<xref rid="pgen.1011611.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Our comprehensive <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> evidence strongly suggests that <italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> plays instrumental roles in ciliary function, thus positioning <italic toggle="yes">RAB23</italic> as part of the family of ciliary genes. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the pathological mechanisms of Carpenter syndrome and pave the way for future development of clinical interventions. Additionally, the mouse mutants represent a valuable animal model for further investigations into the disease mechanism of Carpenter syndrome. Continued research in this area is imperative to advance our understanding and improve the clinical management of debilitating ciliopathy disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Animal and ethics approval</title><p>All animal protocols followed animal handling guideline approved by Hong Kong Baptist University Institutional Research Ethics Committee, the Department of Health, Hong Kong, as well as SingHealth Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Singapore.
