The DUF789 family is one of the least studied of these, especially in economically significant crops like cotton (<italic toggle="yes">Gossypium</italic> spp.), whose possible function in fibre production and abiotic stress response is yet unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">In a comprehensive genome-wide analysis, a total of 91 <italic toggle="yes">DUF789</italic> genes were identified in four <italic toggle="yes">Gossypium</italic> species: <italic toggle="yes">G. arboreum</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">G. barbadense</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">G. raimondii</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">G. hirsutum</italic>. Evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses placed the <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> proteins into different clades, with purifying selection identified as the major evolutionary force. Analyses of gene structure and conserved motifs revealed considerable structural diversity, with closely related genes showing similar exon&#8211;intron patterns and motif compositions. Synteny and duplication analyses showed that segmental and tandem duplications contributed to the DUF789 family expansion in cotton. Analysis of cis-regulatory elements revealed that the GhDUF789 promoters are enriched in motifs responsive to hormonal, developmental, light-induced and abiotic stresses. GO enrichment analyses, prediction of protein&#8211;protein interaction and secondary and tertiary structure modelling, indicated that GhDUF789 proteins are involved in clathrin-mediated vesicle trafficking and membrane trafficking. The miRNA target prediction revealed regulatory interactions with conserved miRNAs from cotton, in particular ghr-miR414 and ghr-miR396. Expression profiling based on transcriptome analysis, supported by validation using qRT-PCR, revealed that several <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes are differentially expressed during fibre development and respond strongly to drought, heat, salinity and cold stress, especially in drought-tolerant genotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">This study provides the first comprehensive characterization of the DUF789 gene family in cotton and offers new insights into its evolutionary dynamics, structural features and potential role in fibre development and adaptation to abiotic stress.

These multi-omics approaches have also accelerated the identification of gene families in diverse plant species, revealing conserved regulatory elements and species-specific expansions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite these advances, a considerable proportion of plant genes remain poorly characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These include proteins with domains of unknown function (DUFs), a broad class of evolutionarily conserved domains without a clearly defined biological function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Chris Ponting was the first to identify and label these domains as DUF1 and DUF2 in 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Since then, genome sequencing efforts have led to the identification of many more DUF families. The Pfam version 35.0, database consists of 19,632 families, of which 4,795 are classified as DUFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In particular, DUF-containing proteins - especially those with DUF231, DUF1218 and DUF724 domains have been functionally linked to important aspects of plant development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Recent studies on model species such as A. <italic toggle="yes">thaliana</italic> and O. <italic toggle="yes">sativa</italic> have provided initial insights into the possible functions of several DUF families. For example, in <italic toggle="yes">A. thaliana</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TBL3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TBR</italic>, which encode DUF231 domain-containing proteins, are essential for secondary cell wall biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Since cellulose is a major component of plant cell walls, proteins with DUF266 domains are thought to be involved in their biosynthesis and may function as glycosyltransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Disruption of <italic toggle="yes">DUF266</italic> genes in rice led to a significant reduction in cellulose content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In A. <italic toggle="yes">thaliana</italic>, six genes of the RUS family encoded proteins that contained a DUF647 domain. Of these, <italic toggle="yes">RUS1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">RUS2</italic> are essential for early seedling development, vitamin B6 homeostasis and auxin transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], while <italic toggle="yes">RUS6</italic> has broad developmental expression, especially in flowers, indicating its evolutionary importance in <italic toggle="yes">A. thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Similarly, Verg&#232;s et al. (2023) reported the expression of 23 <italic toggle="yes">DUF</italic> genes in the reproductive organs of <italic toggle="yes">A. thaliana</italic>, with most of them localized in the endosperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The <italic toggle="yes">DUF239</italic> genes show different expression patterns, suggesting a specialized role for neprosin-related proteins, especially during seed maturation. The role of DUF gene families in abiotic stress responses in rice and <italic toggle="yes">A. thaliana</italic> has also been thoroughly studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The expression of <italic toggle="yes">DUF</italic> genes is also influenced by abiotic stress and phytohormonal signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For example, the Arabidopsis genes <italic toggle="yes">AtRDUF1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">AtRDUF2</italic> are upregulated by abscisic acid (ABA) and drought, and their reduced expression impairs drought tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Transgenic <italic toggle="yes">A. thaliana</italic> plants overexpressing the salt-responsive gene <italic toggle="yes">TaSRHP</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">DUF581</italic>) show increased tolerance to salt stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Similarly, overexpression of the transcription factor <italic toggle="yes">TaSRG</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">DUF662</italic>) improves salt tolerance in both rice and <italic toggle="yes">A. thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In rice, <italic toggle="yes">OsDUF6</italic> is crucial for salt stress tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], whereas overexpression of a DUF-containing gene from alfalfa (<italic toggle="yes">MsDUF</italic>) negatively affects osmotic stress responses in transgenic tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The DUF221 and ATDUF4228 domains have also been strongly associated with ABA-mediated abiotic stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A comprehensive analysis of <italic toggle="yes">BrDUF506</italic> genes across the <italic toggle="yes">Brassica rapa</italic> genome has revealed a possible role in sexual reproduction and abiotic stress tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Taken together, these results emphasize the functional versatility and physiological importance of DUF-containing genes in the regulation of plant growth, development and environmental adaptation. However, except a few well-characterized families, the biological functions of most DUF domains including DUF789, remain poorly understood and require further investigation.</p><p id="Par7">The DUF789 family has received little attention in the scientific literature. Although it has been listed in the major protein domain databases and identified in several plant genomes, its functional characterization is still largely unexplored. In <italic toggle="yes">A. thaliana</italic>, several <italic toggle="yes">DUF789</italic> genes are expressed in reproductive organs, including flowers and developing seeds, suggesting a possible role in organ development or fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, few mechanistic studies have addressed their molecular functions, subcellular localizations, or roles in specific signaling pathways. Moreover, no comprehensive analysis has been performed on polyploid crops, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of their evolutionary diversification, regulatory mechanisms and potential contributions to agronomically important traits.</p><p id="Par8">Bridging this knowledge gap is particularly important for economically important species, where improved annotation of poorly characterized gene families could support targeted breeding strategies. One such polyploid crop in which <italic toggle="yes">DUF789</italic> genes are still completely unexplored is cotton (G. <italic toggle="yes">hirsutum</italic>), the world&#8217;s leading natural fiber crop. G. <italic toggle="yes">hirsutum</italic> is an allotetraploid species (AADD, 2n&#8201;=&#8201;4x&#8201;=&#8201;52) resulting from the hybridization of two diploid ancestors, G. <italic toggle="yes">arboreum</italic> (A genome) and G. <italic toggle="yes">raimondii</italic> (D genome) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Their genomic complexity poses a challenge for the characterization of gene families, but also provides an ideal system for the study of gene duplication, sub functionalization and neofunctionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Cotton fiber development undergoes tightly regulated stages during cell initiation, elongation, secondary wall deposition, and maturation, and is controlled by a complex network of structural and regulatory genes, many of which remain poorly characterized. While other DUF families have been implicated in cotton stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], a genome-wide characterization of the DUF789 gene family in cotton has not yet been performed. To fill this gap, we performed the first genome-wide characterization of the DUF789 gene family in four cotton species: in the two cultivated allotetraploids <italic toggle="yes">Gossypium hirsutum</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">G. barbadense</italic>, as well as in their diploid ancestors <italic toggle="yes">G. arboreum</italic> (A genome) and <italic toggle="yes">G. raimondii</italic> (D genome). The inclusion of the diploid ancestors allowed us to trace the evolutionary origin, expansion and divergence of <italic toggle="yes">DUF789</italic> genes before polyploidization, while comparative analyses of the tetraploids provided insights into gene retention, duplication and probable neofunctionalisation. We systematically identified <italic toggle="yes">DUF789</italic> genes in all four species and analysed their gene structures, conserved motifs, phylogenetic relationships and chromosomal distributions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>GhDUF789 gene family identification</title><p id="Par9">The genome annotation and reference sequence datasets for the tetraploid cotton species Gossypium <italic toggle="yes">barbadense</italic> (version 1.1) and G. <italic toggle="yes">hirsutum</italic> (version 2.1) and their diploid ancestors G. <italic toggle="yes">raimondii</italic> and G. <italic toggle="yes">arboreum</italic> (both version 2.1) are from the CottonMD database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://yanglab.hzau.edu.cn/CottonMD/download.1">https://yanglab.hzau.edu.cn/CottonMD/download.1</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. All of the DUF789 gene family&#8217;s (AtDUF789) annotated protein sequences in <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> were retrieved from the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arabidopsis.org/">https://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link>). The Pfam database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/pfam/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/pfam/</ext-link>) was used to identify the members of the GhDUF789 gene family corresponding to Pfam ID PF05623 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile was downloaded accordingly. The Pfam database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/pfam/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/pfam/</ext-link>) was used to identify the members of the <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> gene family corresponding to Pfam ID PF05623. This was specifically selected as it represents the only curated and widely accepted HMM profile for the DUF789 domain. This domain model was derived from a high quality multiple sequence alignment of DUF789-containing proteins from various eukaryotic lineages, including plants, and is considered the standard for DUF789 annotation in current genomic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although the biological function of the DUF789 domain has not yet been characterized, PF05623 provides the most comprehensive and accurate representation of the domain available in Pfam version 35.0, making it the best choice for the identification of the gene family. To ensure accurate identification and comprehensive coverage of functional DUF789 proteins, HMMER-based detection was followed by rigorous cross-validation with SMART, Pfam re-verification and Conserved Domain Database (CDD) analyses. This integrative approach confirms that all detected candidates possess the canonical DUF789 domain and minimizes the risk of false positives or partial matches. The protein domain sequences for <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> candidates were extracted from the proteomes of the four cotton species using BLASTP in conjunction with HMMER version 3.0. An E-value threshold of 1e<sup>&#8722;20</sup> was applied to ensure the specificity of candidate identification. For further validation, the putative DUF789 protein sequences were cross-verified by submission to the Pfam and SMART databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/">http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/</ext-link><italic toggle="yes">)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and a Conserved Domain Database (CDD) analysis was performed via NCBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] to confirm the presence of the conserved DUF789 domain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Physicochemical characterization and subcellular localization prediction</title><p id="Par10">The isoelectric points, amino acid lengths, and molecular weights of DUF789 proteins were assessed through physicochemical characterization using the ExPASy ProtParam tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html">http://us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html</ext-link><italic toggle="yes">)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

The identification was based on the sequence homology to 11 DUF789 proteins of A. <italic toggle="yes">thaliana</italic> from the TAIR database. A total of 91 <italic toggle="yes">DUF789</italic> genes were annotated, which are distributed among the individual species as follows: G. <italic toggle="yes">hirsutum</italic> (24), G. <italic toggle="yes">barbadense</italic> (31), G. <italic toggle="yes">arboreum</italic> (18), and G. <italic toggle="yes">raimondii</italic> (18).

This suggests the occurrence of post-polyploidization gene loss or differential gene retention. Such patterns are frequently observed in polyploid genomes, where selective gene loss, genome fractionation, and sub functionalization contribute to gene family contraction or expansion. The disparity between the two tetraploids further implies lineage-specific evolutionary trajectories, with <italic toggle="yes">G. barbadense</italic> retaining more duplicates than <italic toggle="yes">G. hirsutum</italic>, possibly due to relaxed purifying selection or functional divergence.</p><p id="Par22">To investigate the molecular properties of the DUF789 proteins, we analyzed their physicochemical properties, including protein length, molecular weight (MW), theoretical pI, GRAVY score, aliphatic index and instability index (Table S2). Despite the conservation of the DUF789 domain, significant differences were observed between species for these parameters. In <italic toggle="yes">G. hirsutum</italic>, the DUF789 proteins were between 307 and 429 amino acids in length and had a molecular weight between 35.34 and 48.29&#160;kDa. The theoretical pI values varied between 4.54 and 7.67, indicating a wide range of predicted net charges under physiological conditions. GRAVY values were uniformly negative (&#8211;0.677 to &#8722;&#8201;0.397), confirming the hydrophilic nature of GhDUF789 proteins. The aliphatic index ranged from 61.74 to 76.66, indicating moderate thermostability, while the instability index values ranged from 41.84 to 81.52, reflecting the variability of the predicted in vivo stability (Figure S1). These physicochemical properties can have direct effects on subcellular localization, molecular interactions and protein function under different cellular conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. For example, proteins with lower pI values (acidic range) are more likely to function in environments such as the cytoplasm or acidic organelles, whereas proteins with higher or near-neutral pI values are more likely to have nuclear or plastid-associated activities, supporting a possible role in transcriptional regulation or metabolic coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In particular, proteins such as GbDUF789-A15 (&gt;&#8201;100&#160;kDa) are likely to be domain fusion variants that may have acquired novel functions related to vesicle trafficking, stress response or transcriptional regulation, which is further supported by the GO enrichment and protein interaction data (Sections "<xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec">Prediction of interactions between proteins (PPIs), secondary structure, and 3D structure of members of the GhDUF789 family of cotton</xref>", "<xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Interaction between GhDUF789 genes and MiRNAs in upland cotton</xref>" and "<xref rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec">GO enrichment analysis of members of the GhDUF789 family</xref>"). The size differences also suggest different interaction capacities, with larger DUF789 proteins possibly acting as scaffold-like elements in multiprotein complexes. Overall, these results suggest that the observed variability in physicochemical parameters contributes to structural and functional diversification within the DUF789 family, possibly due to sub functionalization or neofunctionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">A comparable pattern was observed in <italic toggle="yes">G. barbadense</italic>, where DUF789 proteins ranged from 289 to 1203 amino acids in length and exhibited molecular weights between 33.16 and 132.82&#160;kDa. The pI values extended from 4.61 to 8.78, with several proteins such as GbDUF789-A15 and GbDUF789-D20 displaying both high molecular weights (&gt;&#8201;100&#160;kDa) and basic PI values (&gt;&#8201;7.9), which may indicate functional divergence or domain fusion events absent in the diploid progenitors. In contrast, the diploid species <italic toggle="yes">G. arboreum</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">G. raimondii</italic> harbored shorter DUF789 proteins, ranging from 298 to 392 amino acids, with molecular weights between approximately 33 and 44.5&#160;kDa. Their PI values spanned 4.49 to 6.52, and GRAVY scores remained negative, confirming their hydrophilic nature. The aliphatic and instability indices were broadly comparable to the tetraploids, indicating a conserved structural framework across ploidy levels. Subcellular localization of the identified DUF789 proteins was predicted using the CELLO computational tool.

The resulting circular diagram displays robust syntenic connections between pairs of homologous chromosomes such as A05&#8211;D05, A06&#8211;D06 and A07&#8211;D07, indicating conserved ancestral blocks that were maintained after allopolyploidization. The high level of collinearity that has been preserved between the subgenomes is demonstrated by these connections, which are illustrated by green curves. In contrast, a subset of syntenic connections highlighted in red indicates possible gene rearrangements, translocations or non-collinear duplications, suggesting an ongoing restructuring of the genome since the formation of the tetraploid. This intragenomic synteny not only supports the hypothesis of a common origin of subgenomes A and D, but also suggests that internal duplications and chromosomal dynamics have contributed to the expansion and divergence of the <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> gene family.</p><p id="Par35">In addition, the selection pressure on DUF789 gene pairs was assessed by calculating the ratio of non-synonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) substitution rates (Ka/Ks).

The phylogenetic tree (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A) grouped the GhDUF789 proteins into three distinct clades (I&#8211;III), indicating functional diversification during evolution. Members within the same clade showed strong sequence similarity, providing a basis for comparative structural and functional inference. Domain architecture analysis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B) confirmed that all GhDUF789 proteins contain the canonical DUF789 domain that defines this family. No additional domains were detected, suggesting that the functional diversity of these proteins may result primarily from other regulatory features such as gene structure or motif composition. Gene structure analysis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C) revealed considerable differences in the exon&#8211;intron organization of the <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes. The number of exons ranged from three to nine, indicating different structural architectures. This variation can be attributed to evolutionary events such as exon or intron gain and loss, which are known to drive gene family expansion and possible neofunctionalization. Remarkably, genes within the same phylogenetic group generally had similar exon&#8211;intron configurations, supporting the phylogenetic classification and indicating evolutionary conservation at the structural level. Analysis of the conserved motifs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D) identified ten distinct motifs distributed across the GhDUF789 proteins. Motifs 1, 3 and 7 were consistently present, suggesting that they play an essential role in maintaining the structural integrity or basic function of the DUF789 proteins. Conversely, the presence of clade-specific motifs - e.g. motifs 5 and 9 in clade II may indicate specialized regulatory or functional roles in the subgroups, possibly reflecting underfunctionalization after gene duplication. Sequence conservation analysis using sequence logos (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E) revealed several highly conserved amino acid residues within the DUF789 domain. These residues are likely critical for maintaining structural stability or mediating protein interactions, particularly in response to developmental or environmental stimuli. The differences in residue conservation between clades may reflect adaptive divergence under different selective pressures. Overall, this comprehensive analysis of phylogeny, domain structure, exon&#8211;intron organization, motif distribution and sequence conservation highlights both the conserved core architecture and clade-specific specializations of the <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> gene family.

The promoters of GhDUF789D-24, GhDUF789D-20 and GhDUF789A-8 showed the highest density of these motifs, indicating a potential role in photomorphogenesis, diurnal rhythm and chloroplast gene expression. The stress-responsive category (489 elements) was the most functionally diverse. MBS motifs (137) were the most abundant, followed by ARE (anaerobic induction; 53), STRE (general stress response; 43), LTR (low temperature response; 26) and W-box (22; WRKY TF binding). Other motifs associated with biotic stress were TC-rich repeats (16), the WUN motif (12) and WRE3 (7). Genes such as GhDUF789D-13, GhDUF789D-18 and GhDUF789D-23 showed extensive arrangements of these elements, suggesting a regulatory role under abiotic and biotic stress. The hormone-responsive group (239 elements) included motifs for several hormone pathways. ERE (59) was the most abundant, followed by ABRE (42), ABRE3a (18) and ABRE4 (13), indicating strong ABA- and ethylene-related reactivity. Jasmonic acid-related TGACG and CGTCA motifs were also frequent (32 in total), as were gibberellin-related P-box, GARE and TATC-box elements (30 in total). Auxin-related TGA boxes, TGA elements and AuxRR cores were identified in 12 cases and the salicylic acid-responsive TCA element was found in 7 cases.

The AAGAA motif (45) was the most abundant, followed by the O2 site (13), the CAT box (7), the GA motif (7) and other elements such as the gap box and the F box (5 each). These motifs are involved in seed development, meristem activity and cellular differentiation. The GhDUF789D-17, GhDUF789A-5 and GhDUF789D-15 promoters were particularly enriched in these elements, indicating stage-specific developmental regulation.

Significant interactions were further observed with AREP1, a protein involved in mitochondrial regulation, and with MPL12.4 and MPL12.5, components of the large mitochondrial ribosomal subunit. These interactions suggest that GhDUF789 proteins may be implicated in mitochondrial processes such as energy metabolism and protein biosynthesis. Other predicted interactors, including F10C21.3, F10B6.6, F12B17_240, and F10C12.140, represent additional conserved or hypothetical proteins that could potentially expand the functional repertoire of GhDUF789 proteins.

The elements were categorised into alpha helices, beta turns, extended strands, and random coils (Table S6). Alpha helices constituted the predominant ordered structural component, although their proportion was relatively modest, ranging from 19.35% (GhDUF789A-10) to 25.95% (GhDUF789A-12 and GhDUF789D-24). Extended strands contributed between 6.11% (GhDUF789A-6) and 11.40% (GhDUF789D-17), demonstrating the presence of limited beta-sheet structures. Notably, beta turns were absent in all GhDUF789 proteins, suggesting a preference for simpler or more flexible loop regions rather than tightly folded turns. Random coils dominated the secondary structure, with proportions ranging from 63.92% (GhDUF789A-12) to 72.73% (GhDUF789A-7), reflecting a high degree of intrinsic disorder and structural flexibility within this protein family.</p><p id="Par46">The 3D structures and models for all 24 GhDUF789 proteins were predicted using the Phyre2 online server.

Each model was created using Phyre2&#8217;s intensive mode, which uses advanced homology-based fold detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Phyre2 confidence values represent the estimated probability that the predicted fold is correct, with values above 80% generally considered high confidence in comparative modelling pipelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In our analysis, Phyre2 confidence values ranged from 81 to 92%, with the majority of residuals in each model modelled at &gt;&#8201;90% confidence. These values reflect a high degree of reliability and robustness in the structural predictions.

Most models also showed an alignment coverage of more than 80%, ensuring structural completeness and accuracy. The 3D modelling results showed that the GhDUF789 proteins have a high degree of structural similarity, suggesting a common evolutionary origin (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C). The DUF789 domain primarily adopted a mixed alpha-helical and coiled conformation, consistent with its role in flexible protein&#8211;protein interactions. Most GhDUF789 proteins were modelled using templates containing DUF789 domains, with C-score values ranging from 0.81 to 0.92. C-scores in this range correspond to high-confidence models suitable for functional interpretation in structural plant genomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. These models showed predominantly random coil regions interspersed with ordered helices, consistent with the predictions of secondary structure. The strong agreement between secondary and tertiary structure data highlights the internal consistency and reliability of our modelling approach.

</p><p id="Par63">To explore the regulatory basis of these different expression patterns, we analyzed the promoter regions (2&#160;kb upstream) of the <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes for the presence of stress-related cis-acting elements. Remarkably, many strongly stress-responsive genes contained multiple copies of known abiotic stress-responsive motifs. For example, <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A-1</italic>, which was transcriptionally activated under drought, cold and salt stress, contained abundant ABRE (abscisic acid-responsive) and MBS (MYB-binding site for drought) elements. Similarly, <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A-12</italic>, which responded strongly to cold and salt stress, was enriched in DRE (dehydration-responsive element) and CGTCA-motif (jasmonic acid-responsive) elements. <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789D-18</italic>, which is highly drought-induced, contained both MBS and LTR elements (associated with responses to low temperature and desiccation). In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789D-17</italic>, which showed negligible transcriptional changes under any stress condition, lacked these key regulatory elements. This pattern suggests a potential regulatory correlation between the architecture of the <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-elements and the transcriptional sensitivity of <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes to abiotic stimuli.</p><p id="Par64">To validate the transcriptomic profiling results, the expression patterns of three selected GhDUF789 genes (<italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A-1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A-8</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789D-17</italic>) were further analyzed by qRT-PCR analysis in two contrasting upland cotton genotypes: a drought-resistant line and a drought-susceptible line, under both control and drought stress conditions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>E). Under control conditions, all three genes showed relatively low and comparable basal expression levels in both genotypes (normalized to 1.0). Significant up-regulation was observed after drought, especially in the resistant genotype. <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A-8</italic> showed an approximately 5.5-fold increase in the resistant line compared to a 2.0-fold increase in the susceptible line. Similarly, <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A-1</italic> showed an approximately 4.8-fold induction in the resistant genotype, while a 1.5-fold increase was observed in the susceptible genotype. GhDUF789D-17 also showed increased expression, with a 3.2-fold increase in the resistant genotype and a 1.8-fold increase in the susceptible line. The qRT-PCR data support the hypothesis that genes with stress-responsive cis-elements (e.g. ABRE, MBS) are transcriptionally activated under stress conditions. These combined results suggest that cis-regulatory motifs in GhDUF789 promoters are likely to be functionally relevant and may play a predictive role in stress-induced gene expression patterns. This correlation provides a molecular basis for the selection of candidate genes for breeding stress-resistant cotton. Although the RNA-Seq data were obtained from a drought-induced time-course experiment in genotype TM-1 and the qRT-PCR experiments were performed using endpoint comparisons in different drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive genotypes, the direction of expression trends was largely consistent across platforms. In particular, all three genes showed stress-induced upregulation in both data sets. To further assess the degree of agreement, we compared fold-change trends and found strong qualitative agreement between qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq.&#160;While exact fold-change values varied as expected due to differences in sampling time points, genotypic background, and measurement sensitivity, the overall agreement in direction and magnitude of expression indicates robust cross-platform validation. No major discrepancies were observed. However, minor differences in the extent of upregulation (e.g. higher fold-change values in qRT-PCR for <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A-8</italic>) may reflect increased transcript stability or genotype-specific regulatory effects not detected in the TM-1 reference dataset. These results support the reliability of the transcriptomic data and confirm the involvement of the selected <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes in the response to drought stress. The correlation between the expression platforms also strengthens the case for these genes as candidates for stress-resistant cotton breeding programs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par65">Domains of Unknown Function (DUFs) represent a considerable proportion of annotated but poorly characterized proteins in various plant genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

The predicted nuclear and chloroplastic localization of most GhDUF789 proteins suggests a possible involvement in gene regulation, metabolic adaptation or organellar functions under developmental or environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Comparable subcellular localizations have been reported for other DUF-containing proteins, such as members of the DUF231 and DUF266 family, which are involved in cell wall biosynthesis and stress signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The wide range of pI values (from strongly acidic to near neutral) for the GhDUF789 proteins could reflect different electrostatic interactions affecting subcellular compartmentalization, protein&#8211;protein association or response to local pH environments. Thus, proteins with acidic pI values might be better suited for nucleoplasmic or vacuolar functions, whereas proteins with neutral or basic pI values might be involved in chloroplastic or cytosolic signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Similarly, variation in molecular weight across GhDUF789 proteins, particularly the presence of higher MW isoforms (&gt;&#8201;100&#160;kDa) in G. <italic toggle="yes">barbadense</italic>, may indicate domain fusion events or structural extensions that facilitate scaffold functions in vesicle trafficking or stress-associated signaling. These MW and pI patterns appear to correlate with distinct clades or functional subgroups of DUF789 proteins, consistent with the structural diversification observed in motif and exon&#8211;intron architectures, and analogous to functional classifications reported in other DUF families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. These physicochemical features provide functional evidence consistent with the predictions of subcellular localization and GO annotation, supporting the hypothesis that GhDUF789 proteins contribute to a variety of regulatory and stress-responsive pathways in cotton. Consistent predictions across multiple subcellular localization platforms (TargetP, WoLF PSORT and LocTree3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]) indicated that several GhDUF789 proteins are likely localized to the nucleus or chloroplasts, suggesting regulatory or organelle-associated roles.

While experimental validation was not conducted in this study, two representative genes, GhDUF789A-1 and GhDUF789D-3, were prioritized based on their expression profiles and localization signals.

Importantly, the inferred clades were supported by high bootstrap values (&#8805;&#8201;70%), indicating strong statistical reliability of the phylogenetic relationships.

Here, ten conserved motifs were identified among the GhDUF789 proteins, with individual members displaying between one and ten motifs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D, E). This diverse yet structured motif composition suggests that the GhDUF789 proteins may have undergone subtle functional diversification, although a central functional architecture was retained. In contrast, DUF789 proteins in soybean have been reported to have more homogeneous motif patterns as observed by Zeynab et al. (2025) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

Our results show that <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes have between three and nine exons (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C), a range that is similar to other plant species, such as Arabidopsis and soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Remarkably, genes within the same phylogenetic clusters (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A) showed largely similar exon&#8211;intron organizations, suggesting evolutionary conservation following duplication events. These results suggest that the GhDUF789 gene family has undergone limited but functionally significant intron gain and loss during its evolutionary history, possibly enabling alternative splicing and increasing protein diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p><p id="Par70">Examination of the cis-acting regulatory elements within the <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> promoters revealed a complex landscape of motifs associated with developmental regulation, hormone signaling, photosensitivity and adaptation to abiotic stress (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Among them, motifs such as GARE (gibberellin-responsive), ERE (ethylene-responsive), TCA (salicylic acid-responsive), ABRE (ABA-responsive), ARE (anaerobic induction), G-box and box 4 were strikingly abundant, suggesting that <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes may act as key regulators in the integration of developmental and environmental signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].

In particular, GARE elements have been associated with growth modulation under salt and drought stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], and ABRE motifs play a central role in ABA-mediated responses to drought and osmotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].

The integration of promoter architecture and expression data thus provides a rational framework for the selection of candidate genes in molecular breeding programs aimed at improving the climate adaptability of cotton.</p><p id="Par72">In addition to abiotic stress responses, our findings also suggest that promoter cis-element architecture may influence tissue-specific gene expression during fibre development.

In cotton, repeated rounds of gene duplication followed by selective gene loss and recombination have characterized the evolutionary development of numerous gene families, including GhDUF789 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Consistent with this, our study revealed that the total number of <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes in G. <italic toggle="yes">hirsutum</italic> and G. <italic toggle="yes">barbadense</italic> is lower than the combined number of their diploid ancestors, G. <italic toggle="yes">arboreum</italic> and G. <italic toggle="yes">raimondii</italic>, suggesting that gene fractionation accompanied polyploid formation.

Most GhDUF789 proteins exhibited homology-based associations with proteins containing DUF789 domains or with proteins of unknown function. This pattern is consistent with the observation that many DUF (Domain of Unknown Function) proteins are increasingly recognized as critical players in plant stress adaptation and developmental regulation, despite their initial annotation gaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Structural modelling revealed that GhDUF789 proteins predominantly have an architecture characterized by a relatively low alpha-helix content and predominantly random turns. Proteins with such flexible, coil-rich structures are thought to facilitate dynamic interactions and adaptive conformational changes under stress conditions, supporting their role in flexible regulatory complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>].</p><p id="Par76">In addition, remarkable differences in the composition of the secondary structure of GhDUF789 members were observed. Some proteins exhibited more ordered, helical features, while others showed a higher degree of structural disorder. Such structural diversity within gene families is often associated with functional divergence, allowing proteins to take on specialized or flexible roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. This diversity suggests possible functional divergence within the gene family, where certain GhDUF789 proteins may fulfil more static structural or catalytic roles, while others may act as flexible scaffolds or signaling adaptors in environmental stress responses. Proteins that are enriched in intrinsically disordered regions have been specifically implicated in dynamic regulatory processes and rapid adaptation under stress conditions in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Overall, the combination of predicted PPI networks and 3D structural models suggests that the GhDUF789 family, despite its limited functional characterization, may represent a dynamically adaptable group of proteins that play diverse roles in cotton developmental processes and stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

In addition, ghr-miR396a was predicted to target several <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes (<italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A</italic>&#8722;2, <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A</italic>&#8722;5, <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789D</italic>&#8722;14, <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789D</italic>&#8722;17 and <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789D</italic>&#8722;22), predominantly by cleavage, suggesting that it is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of GhDUF789 family members. miR396 has been observed to be involved in stress responses, including drought and cold tolerance, mediated via an abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. Overall, these results indicate that the identified ghr-miRNAs may be responsible for the adaptation of cotton to various environmental stresses by modulating the expression of <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes. Nevertheless, additional experimental validation is essential to elucidate the specific functional roles of these miRNA&#8211;<italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> regulatory modules.</p><p id="Par78">GO enrichment analysis of GhDUF789 family members revealed significant associations with clathrin-mediated endocytosis, vesicle budding and phosphatidylinositol binding activities. These biological processes are an integral part of membrane transport, which has an essential role in plant growth, development and adaptation to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. The enrichment of clathrin coat assembly and SNARE binding termini suggests that GhDUF789 proteins may contribute to vesicle formation and intracellular transport, processes known to modulate responses to environmental stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. Similar functions have been reported from Arabidopsis and rice, where clathrin-associated signaling pathways have been linked to hormonal signaling and abiotic stress tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. Therefore, it is plausible that GhDUF789 members act at the interface between membrane dynamics and stress resistance in cotton. Further functional validation will be necessary to clarify their exact role.</p><p id="Par79">The results from the expression profiling show that <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes have unique and constitutive expression patterns in different cotton tissues and in response to different abiotic conditions. Analysis of expression in different tissues and developmental stages revealed different patterns, with one subset showing significant upregulation during fibre development. In particular, <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A</italic>&#8722;1, <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A</italic>&#8722;2 and <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A</italic>&#8722;8 showed progressively increased expression during fiber elongation and maturation stages, suggesting that they are involved in secondary cell wall deposition - a hypothesis further strengthened by their GO annotations and promoter motif composition. Similar fiber-specific expression profiles were found in other DUF gene families, such as GhDUF288 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>] and GhDUF1117 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. Conversely, other <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes showed tissue-specific expression patterns with preferential accumulation in organs such as the root, stem or floral structures.</p><p id="Par80">Different expression profiles were also observed under different abiotic stress factors such as heat, cold, salinity and drought. In particular, <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789D</italic>&#8722;20 and <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789D</italic>&#8722;14 were highly upregulated under drought stress, suggesting a possible role in stress tolerance mechanisms. These observations are in tandem with previous findings, such as those of MA et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], who reported that <italic toggle="yes">OsDUF6</italic> was more highly expressed in salt-stressed leaves than in irrigated plants. Similarly, Jayaraman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>] demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">DUF740</italic> promoted root length, thereby improving drought resistance and fruit retention. Although different gene families were studied, the pattern of stress-responsive upregulation observed in <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes is consistent with these previous reports. In addition, FPKM-based expression analysis revealed significant tissue-specific variation among GhDUF789 members. For instance, <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A</italic>&#8722;6 and <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A</italic>&#8722;11 exhibited relatively high expression levels across multiple tissues, whereas others, such as <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A</italic>&#8722;10 and <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789A</italic>&#8722;5, displayed restricted expression confined to specific organs. Analogous expression trends have been reported for DUF family members, such as <italic toggle="yes">DUF668</italic>, which showed predominant expression in leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and <italic toggle="yes">DUF288</italic>, which was broadly expressed across fibre tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. Taken together, our results demonstrate that <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes constitute a structurally conserved yet functionally diversified family, contributing to critical developmental and adaptive processes in cotton. Their potential involvement in fibre quality traits and abiotic stress tolerance makes them promising candidates for molecular breeding initiatives, aimed at improving cotton productivity and resilience under increasingly adverse climatic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par81">The DUF789 gene family in four cotton species was thoroughly identified and characterized throughout the genome in this investigation. A total of 91 <italic toggle="yes">DUF789</italic> genes were recognized, showing conserved domain structures but divergent exon&#8211;intron architectures, motif compositions and chromosomal distributions, suggesting functional diversification after polyploidisation. Phylogenetic and synteny analyses suggested that segmental and tandem duplications contributed substantially to family expansion, with purifying selection acting as the main evolutionary force, although cases of positive selection were also detected. Cis-acting element analysis revealed that GhDUF789 promoters are enriched in regulatory motifs associated with hormonal signaling, developmental processes and abiotic stress responses. Expression profiling revealed that several <italic toggle="yes">GhDUF789</italic> genes are differentially expressed during fibre development and under drought, salt, cold and heat stress, suggesting that they play a central role in fibre maturation and environmental adaptation. Protein&#8211;protein interaction predictions and GO enrichment supported the possible involvement of DUF789 proteins in vesicle transport and stress-related cellular processes. Overall, this study provides the first detailed insights into the structure, evolution and potential biological functions of <italic toggle="yes">DUF789</italic> genes in cotton, providing a valuable resource for future functional studies and for advancing molecular breeding to improve cotton fibre quality and stress tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
