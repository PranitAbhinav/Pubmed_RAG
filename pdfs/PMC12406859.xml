A secondary objective was to compare KAP levels between these two groups and identify predictors of higher KAP.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>A cross-sectional survey study.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>The study was conducted in various hospital wards and outpatient clinics at a single tertiary academic hospital (Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University) in Xiamen, China, from October 2023 to May 2024.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 725 participants were recruited using convenience sampling, comprising 358 patients presenting with lower limb swelling and pain and 367 accompanying family members. Key inclusion criteria were age of &#8805;18 years and the ability to provide informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title><p>Primary outcomes were KAP scores measured by a validated, self-designed questionnaire. Scores &#8805;70% of the maximum possible score for each domain were defined as adequate knowledge (&#8805;16.8/24), a positive attitude (&#8805;19) and proactive practice (&#8805;30.4). Secondary outcomes included the comparison of KAP scores between patients and family members and the identification of factors associated with higher overall KAP levels using multivariate logistic regression analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 725 participants, both patients and family members demonstrated inadequate mean knowledge scores (10.62&#177;4.71&#8201;and 11.88&#177;4.95, respectively, below the adequacy threshold of 16.8), though mean attitude and practice scores were above the positive/proactive thresholds. Family members had significantly higher scores than patients across all domains: knowledge (mean difference: 1.26, p&lt;0.001), attitude (mean difference: 0.55, p=0.031) and practice (mean difference: 1.45, p&lt;0.001). KAP were all positively correlated (all p&lt;0.001). In multivariate analysis of the family member group, a higher education level (OR=3.06, 95%&#8201;CI: 1.70 to 5.49) and being medical personnel (OR=5.21, 95%&#8201;CI: 2.36 to 11.48) were significant predictors of higher overall KAP scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Patients presenting with lower limb symptoms and their families possess inadequate knowledge about DVT, despite generally positive attitudes and proactive practices. Family members represent a key resource with significantly better KAP than patients. Targeted educational interventions, focusing on individuals with lower educational levels and non-medical backgrounds, are crucial to improve DVT awareness and facilitate timely medical consultation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Knowledge</kwd><kwd>Attitude</kwd><kwd>GENERAL MEDICINE (see Internal Medicine)</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p><bold>Comprehensive sample size:</bold> the study collected data from a sizeable cohort of 725 participants, which enhances the reliability of the findings.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Inclusion of family members:</bold> by involving family members, the study provides a broader perspective on knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) regarding deep vein thrombosis (DVT), capturing insights from both patients and their support systems.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Use of a self-designed questionnaire:</bold> the study employed a tailored KAP questionnaire, which can directly address specific knowledge areas and practices related to DVT relevant to the target population.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Limited generalisability:</bold> results may not be generalisable beyond the local geographical setting given the specific cultural and healthcare context in Xiamen, China.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Self-reported data:</bold> reliance on self-reported measures could affect the accuracy of the knowledge and practice assessments due to personal bias or misunderstanding.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p> Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein, predominantly in the legs (eg, femoral vein), obstructs venous return and can lead to lower limb swelling, pain, numbness and other discomforts.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Furthermore, DVT can be potentially life-threatening if a blood clot breaks off and develops into a pulmonary embolism (PE), causing sudden cardiovascular collapse and death.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 3</sup></xref> In China, the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes both DVT and PE, is notably high among hospitalised patients. In China, the burden of DVT is particularly notable, with a large epidemiological study reporting incidence rates of 30.0 per 100&#8201;000 for DVT alone, alongside 8.7 and 3.0 per 100&#8201;000 for PE and PE with DVT, respectively. These figures underscore the significant clinical and public health impact of VTE in the Chinese population.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>The theory of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) posits that knowledge is the foundation for behaviour change, while attitude and belief serve as the driving forces in a three-step process: acquiring knowledge, generating attitudes/beliefs and forming practices/behaviours.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Cognitive change resulting from knowledge acquisition does not necessarily lead to behaviour change; instead, it should first alter perception, which subsequently influences behaviour through this changed perception.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Applying the KAP framework to understand patient and public perspectives on DVT is crucial, as their KAP directly influence health-seeking behaviours and adherence to preventive measures. Evidence suggests that limited KAP is associated with delayed recognition of symptoms, underuse of preventive strategies and increased risk of complications, underscoring the need for KAP-based interventions in DVT prevention. Previous KAP studies on DVT have primarily focused on healthcare professionals, revealing significant gaps in their knowledge and practices regarding DVT prevention.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7 8</sup></xref> While understanding HCPs&#8217; perspectives is important, the patients themselves and their immediate caregivers (family members) play a critical role in recognising early symptoms and seeking timely medical help.

Therefore, enhancing their knowledge and engagement could significantly reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes.</p><p>Given the potential impact of patient and family KAP on DVT outcomes and the limited research in this specific population, particularly within the Chinese cultural context, understanding their perspectives is essential. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the KAP regarding DVT among patients presenting with lower limb swelling and pain, as well as their accompanying family members. Findings from this study are expected to inform the development of targeted educational interventions to improve early recognition, timely management and prevention of DVT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This cross-sectional study was conducted at Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University, from 15 October 2023 to 30 May 2024. The study included patients with lower limb swelling and pain and their family members. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University (xmzsyyky(2023&#8211;164)). Informed consent was obtained electronically from participants who chose to continue with the questionnaire before distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Participant recruitment and response rate</title><p>A total of 805 questionnaires were distributed to eligible patients and their accompanying family members in the outpatient clinics and hospital wards. Of these, 801 were returned, resulting in an initial collection rate of 99.5%. Following a data quality check, 76 questionnaires were excluded. Specifically, 60 questionnaires were excluded because the completion time was less than 90&#8201;s, which suggested inattentive or insincere responses. An additional 16 questionnaires were excluded due to missing informed consent. In total, 725 valid questionnaires were included in the final analysis, yielding a valid response rate of 90.1% (725 out of 805). This sample comprised 358 patients and 367 accompanying family members.</p><p>Inclusion criteria: (1) patients who were presenting to Zhongshan Hospital (either in outpatient clinics or inpatient wards) for their initial medical consultation regarding the current, new-onset episode of lower limb swelling and/or pain. To ensure an accurate assessment of baseline KAP uninfluenced by prior DVT-specific medical education or diagnosis, eligible patients must not have been previously diagnosed with DVT, nor actively undergoing treatment or routine follow-up for a pre-existing DVT condition; (2) accompanying family members of the patients who fulfilled criterion (1); (3) individuals aged 18 years or older; (4) individuals without cognitive impairment that would preclude their ability to understand or complete the questionnaire, as determined by the attending physician or through a brief screening assessment; (5) individuals possessing adequate hearing, reading and writing abilities to sufficiently comprehend and respond to the items presented in the questionnaire; and (6) individuals who voluntarily agreed to participate in the study and provided signed informed consent prior to data collection.</p><p>Exclusion criteria: (1) patients in critical condition with life-threatening risks.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size was calculated using the standard formula for cross-sectional studies:</p><p>n = (Z&#945;/2)&#178; &#215; p &#215; (1&#8722;p) / d&#178;.</p><p>The following assumptions were applied: a 95% CI (Z&#945;/2=1.96), a margin of error (d) of 5% and an estimated prevalence (p) of adequate knowledge of DVT at 50%. The 50% prevalence was chosen to yield the maximum sample size, as no prior studies in this specific population were available to inform a more precise estimate. Based on this calculation, a minimum of 385 participants per group (patients and family members) was required. To account for a potential 15% non-response or invalid questionnaire rate, we adjusted the target to approximately 453 participants per group. Ultimately, a total of 725 valid responses were collected, which meets the minimum sample requirement.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Sample selection quality control</title><p>A convenience sampling strategy was employed to recruit potential participants from the relevant hospital wards and outpatient clinics for questionnaire distribution.</p><p>Prior to the distribution of any questionnaires, an initial screening interview was systematically conducted by trained research staff with all individuals who presented with complaints of lower limb swelling and/or pain. The primary purpose of this screening interview was to rigorously ascertain each individual&#8217;s eligibility based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Specifically, this screening process served to differentiate between individuals experiencing a new-onset episode of lower limb symptoms and seeking their first medical consultation for these specific symptoms without a prior diagnosis or ongoing management for DVT and those patients who were returning for scheduled follow-up appointments related to a previously diagnosed and managed lower limb thrombosis.</p><p>Individuals identified as returning for follow-up care for an existing DVT condition were deemed ineligible for this KAP study and were consequently excluded from participation to prevent potential bias stemming from their prior medical exposure and DVT-specific knowledge.</p><p>Only those individuals who fully met all stipulated inclusion criteria, primarily encompassing first-time presenters for the current symptoms without a prior DVT diagnosis or management history, and who provided informed consent were subsequently invited to complete the questionnaire. Both electronic and paper versions of the questionnaire were provided to accommodate participants&#8217; preferences and ensure accessibility. Elderly individuals or those less familiar with digital tools were assisted with the paper version as needed. Clarifications were provided when patients had difficulty understanding certain professional terms or statements in the questions.</p><p>An electronic questionnaire based on a WeChat mini-programme was used to create an online questionnaire and generate a Quick Response (QR) code. Participants scanned the QR code to log in and complete the questionnaire. To ensure the quality and completeness of the results, each IP address was limited to one submission, and all items were mandatory. A minimum completion time of 90&#8201;s was required for valid submissions. This threshold was determined based on observations during the pilot study, which suggested that 90&#8201;s represented the minimum plausible time for participants to read and thoughtfully respond to all questionnaire items. The research team examined the completeness, internal consistency and plausibility of all questionnaires. Paper questionnaires that were incomplete or showed patterns of consistently selecting the same answers (eg, consistently selecting option &#8216;a&#8217; or &#8216;b&#8217; consecutively) were deemed invalid.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Questionnaire introduction</title><p>The questionnaire was self-designed with reference to relevant guidelines and published literature on DVT-related symptoms, risk factors and management behaviours. It was revised based on feedback from two vascular surgery experts and underwent two rounds of pilot testing before finalisation. The finalised version showed good internal consistency with Cronbach&#8217;s alpha values reported for each dimension. The questionnaire was divided into patient version and family version. Although there were differences in the collection of baseline information between the two versions of the questionnaire, the core assessments remained uniform. For example, in the practice section, patients were asked, &#8216;Do you regularly engage in physical exercise?&#8217;, while family members were asked, &#8216;Do you actively encourage or guide the patient to participate in suitable physical activities?&#8217; This adjustment emphasised the role of family members in promoting healthy behaviours, demonstrating a thoughtful and meticulous questionnaire design.</p><p>The questionnaire underwent modifications based on feedback from two vascular surgery experts regarding common symptoms, susceptibility factors and medication adherence related to DVT. Relevant questions and options were added or revised, and the initial draft underwent two rounds of small-scale testing (30&#8211;40 samples). Adjustments were made based on testing results. The final questionnaire achieved a Cronbach&#8217;s alpha coefficient of 0.826 for patients and 0.742 for family members, covering demographic data and KAP dimensions (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix</xref>). The knowledge dimension comprised 24 questions across two aspects, scored as 1 for correct answers and 0 for incorrect or unclear responses, with scores ranging from 0 to 24 points. The attitude dimension included five questions using a five-point Likert scale, ranging from very positive (5 points) to very negative (1 point), with scores ranging from 5 to 25 points. The practice dimension included eight questions also using a five-point Likert scale, ranging from always (5 points) to never (1 point), with scores ranging from 8 to 40 points. Achieving scores above 70%<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> of the maximum in each section indicated adequate knowledge (16.8), a positive attitude (19) and proactive practice (30.4). This threshold was selected with reference to previous KAP studies, which have commonly adopted a 70% cut-off as a general indicator of satisfactory knowledge and behaviour levels in health-related assessments. While the disease context differs, the 70% benchmark remains a frequently used criterion across similar studies. We acknowledge that this threshold was not specifically validated for DVT in our questionnaire, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was not conducted due to the lack of a clinical gold standard. This limitation has been noted in the discussion section.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The distribution of scores for each dimension was assessed for normality. Normally distributed data are presented as means and SD, while non-normally distributed data are presented as medians with 25th and 75th percentiles. Categorical data describing responses to each question by different demographic characteristics are expressed as n (%). Differences in scores between study groups were analysed as follows: for normally distributed continuous variables, comparisons between two groups were conducted using the t-test; for non-normally distributed continuous variables, the Wilcoxon Mann&#8211;Whitney test was employed. For comparisons among three or more groups with normally distributed continuous variables and equal variances, analysis of variance was used, while the Kruskal&#8211;Wallis test was applied for non-normally distributed data. Correlations between scores in different dimensions were analysed using the Pearson correlation coefficient for normally distributed data and the Spearman correlation coefficient for non-normally distributed data. The total KAP score was used as the dependent variable in single-factor and multifactor logistic regression analyses to explore relationships with demographic data. Median scores were used for categorisation in regression analyses. Variables with a significance level of p&lt;0.1 in single-factor analyses were included in multifactor regression models. Results were reported with P values rounded to three decimal places, and significance was determined at p&lt;0.05. Data analysis was conducted using R 4.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Questionnaire reliability test</title><p>During the formal experiment, the overall Cronbach&#8217;s alpha coefficient for the patient questionnaire and its components showed good internal consistency, with values of 0.7770 for the total scale and 0.7218, 0.7847 and 0.7670 for the KAP sections, respectively. The Kaiser&#8211;Meyer&#8211;Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy for the total scale was 0.8492.

Additionally, there is a considerable deficiency across both populations in recognising the severe consequences of untreated DVT. For instance, only 37.4% of patients (134/358) and 40.9% of family members (150/367) correctly identified chest tightness/shortness of breath as potential consequences, while recognition rates for sudden death risk were even lower at 27.9% (100/358) in patients and 36.8% (135/367) in family caregivers (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Correlation analysis of KAP</title><p>Correlation analyses for overall population showed correlations between knowledge and attitude (r=0.401, p&lt;0.001), knowledge and practice (r=0.341, p&lt;0.001), as well as attitude and practice (r=0.528, p&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S6</xref>).

Family members exhibited significantly higher levels of KAP compared with patients. These results are consistent with previous studies, indicating that patients often lack comprehensive understanding of their conditions, which can negatively affect adherence to medical advice and result in suboptimal health outcomes.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13 14</sup></xref> The insufficient knowledge levels observed in both groups highlight a potential barrier to fully optimising preventive practices for DVT, although the correlation between knowledge and practice was only moderate. While the positive attitudes and proactive behaviours observed are encouraging, they may not be sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with poor knowledge. Without accurate understanding, individuals may implement inappropriate or ineffective preventive measures, misinterpret or overlook key warning signs and ultimately delay seeking medical care&#8212;thereby increasing the risk of complications such as PE or post-thrombotic syndrome.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15 16</sup></xref></p><p>The correlation analyses for both populations revealed significant relationships between knowledge and attitudes, knowledge and practices, and attitudes and practices. These findings are consistent with the KAP model. For example, in the patient population, knowledge was positively correlated with both attitude and practice, and attitude was also positively associated with practice. Similar patterns were observed among family members. Notably, across all subgroups, the correlation between attitude and practice was consistently stronger than that between knowledge and practice, suggesting that while knowledge plays a foundational role, attitudes may exert a more immediate influence on behavioural outcomes. This finding aligns with the KAP framework, which posits that attitudes act as motivational drivers that bridge the gap between knowledge acquisition and behavioural change. Previous studies have also reported that while knowledge is necessary, it is often insufficient on its own to promote consistent health behaviours without the reinforcement of positive attitudes and perceived relevance or self-efficacy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5 6</sup></xref> The relatively stronger correlation between attitude and practice (r=0.528) compared with knowledge and practice (r=0.341) suggests that shaping attitudes&#8212;such as increasing perceived vulnerability or belief in prevention&#8212;may be more effective in influencing DVT-related behaviour than focusing solely on knowledge dissemination. According to commonly accepted statistical conventions, correlation coefficients between 0.3 and 0.5 are considered moderate, while those above 0.5 are regarded as strong. In this study, the correlation between attitude and practice (r&gt;0.5 in all subgroups) indicates a strong association, underscoring the critical role of attitudes in shaping preventive behaviours related to DVT. This finding implies that interventions aiming to improve DVT-related practices might benefit from not only increasing factual knowledge but also actively shaping positive attitudes&#8212;such as perceived severity, self-efficacy and trust in prevention measures&#8212;to drive more effective health behaviours.</p><p>In both the patient and family populations, gender did not show a significant impact on KAP scores, with the exception of knowledge among family members, where females had higher scores. This aligns with some literature suggesting that females often engage more in health-related education and activities, possibly due to their caregiving roles.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17 18</sup></xref> Age was a significant factor for attitudes and practices among patients, with older age groups generally having lower scores. This trend might be attributed to the physical and cognitive declines associated with ageing, which could affect their ability to maintain positive health attitudes and practices.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19 20</sup></xref> Conversely, in the family population, younger age groups had significantly higher knowledge and attitude scores. Younger family members might be more engaged in health education and digital information sources, enhancing their knowledge and attitudes towards DVT.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21 22</sup></xref></p><p>Educational level was significantly associated with higher KAP scores in both populations in univariate analyses; however, in the patient group, this association did not remain significant after adjusting for other variables in the multivariate model. Patients and family members with an associate&#8217;s degree and above had significantly higher KAP scores. Higher educational attainment is often linked to better health literacy, enabling individuals to understand and engage more effectively in health management.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23 24</sup></xref> This result was further supported by multivariate logistic regression, where higher education was independently associated with higher KAP scores in family members. Job type significantly influenced KAP scores, with medical personnel showing the highest scores across all dimensions in both populations. This is expected, as medical personnel have professional knowledge and are likely to practise better health behaviours.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25 26</sup></xref> Retired patients also had higher KAP scores, possibly due to having more time to focus on their health and attend medical appointments. In family members, medical personnel had the highest odds of higher KAP scores, supporting the influence of professional knowledge on health management.</p><p>Having underlying medical conditions was associated with higher attitude scores in patients. Patients with chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases and diabetes may develop better attitudes towards disease management due to their continuous engagement with healthcare services. However, there were no significant differences in knowledge and practice scores, indicating that the presence of chronic disease alone does not necessarily improve knowledge or practices without targeted education. Patients accompanied by someone to the doctor had significantly lower knowledge and attitude scores compared with those who came alone. This might suggest a reliance on companions for health information and support, potentially reducing personal engagement in learning about disease.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27 28</sup></xref> Additionally, patients who self-reported this as their first visit for lower limb swelling and pain exhibited significantly higher attitude scores. This may reflect a heightened initial motivation or concern about their symptoms, which could diminish with time or repeated exposure to the healthcare system. These findings suggest the importance of capitalising on this early engagement window to deliver impactful health education.</p><p>Overall, family members demonstrated higher knowledge scores than patients, particularly in identifying DVT symptoms and understanding key risk factors and consequences of delayed treatment. For example, many patients remained uncertain about less obvious but clinically relevant symptoms such as leg cramps and skin discolouration, which are essential for early detection. Similarly, awareness of risk factors like prolonged bed rest, obesity and advanced age was limited across both groups, but significantly lower among patients. This knowledge gap may delay timely intervention and is consistent with prior research linking poor disease understanding to unfavourable health outcomes.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29 30</sup></xref> Despite these gaps in knowledge, attitudes towards DVT were generally positive among both patients and family members. Notably, family members expressed greater concern about the risks of DVT and placed higher value on professional education and physical activity as preventive strategies. These attitudes are encouraging, as they provide a motivational foundation for adopting healthy behaviours; however, without accurate and comprehensive knowledge, such attitudes may not translate into effective action.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31 32</sup></xref> In terms of practice, family members again outperformed patients, particularly in guiding or encouraging timely medical consultation, regular physical activity and dietary regulation. This aligns with existing literature emphasising the supportive role of family in chronic disease management.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33 34</sup></xref> Nevertheless, specific behaviours such as consistent medication use and wearing compression stockings remain suboptimal in both groups, suggesting the need for reinforced patient and caregiver education on adherence-related practices.</p><p>To address these gaps, targeted educational interventions are essential. Programmes should focus on lesser-known symptoms and risk factors, such as prolonged sitting, obesity and the severe consequences of untreated DVT. Multimedia resources, interactive workshops and updated training for both patients and families can improve engagement and knowledge retention. Family-centred strategies are also critical&#8212;training family members with higher KAP levels as &#8216;home health coaches&#8217;, or designing joint educational tasks, may enhance patient adherence and self-management.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35 36</sup></xref></p><p>Digital tools like mobile apps and online platforms can further support DVT education and behaviour monitoring.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37 38</sup></xref> Incentive-based approaches, such as rewards for regular follow-up and treatment adherence, may also improve compliance. By applying these targeted and family-inclusive strategies, we can more effectively close knowledge gaps and improve DVT prevention and management outcomes.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39 40</sup></xref></p><p>This study has several limitations. First, as a cross-sectional study conducted at a single hospital, the findings may not be generalisable to other settings. Second, convenience sampling may have introduced selection bias, potentially limiting the representativeness of the sample and the external validity of the findings. Third, the use of a self-designed questionnaire, although validated and pilot-tested, lacks formal construct validity testing through factor analysis, which limits our ability to confirm alignment with theoretical KAP dimensions. Fourth, the reliance on self-reported data may introduce social desirability or recall bias. Fifth, logistic regression models based on dichotomised KAP scores, while useful for interpretation, may reduce the precision of effect size estimation compared with models using continuous data. Finally, despite efforts to distinguish &#8216;first-time visitors&#8217; for lower limb swelling and pain, some misclassification may remain, and differences in health-seeking motivations across subgroups could contribute to response heterogeneity. Additionally, the use of a 70% threshold to define adequate KAP, although commonly applied in prior studies, was not internally validated in our context due to the absence of a reference standard for ROC analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, both patients with lower limb swelling and pain, as well as their family members, demonstrated inadequate knowledge, positive attitudes and proactive practices towards DVT, with family members showing significantly higher KAP levels compared with patients. To improve DVT management outcomes, targeted educational interventions such as hospital-based education sessions, multimedia materials or community outreach led by trained medical staff should be implemented to enhance both patients&#8217; and family members&#8217; knowledge about DVT, leveraging their generally positive attitudes and proactive behaviours. Future studies should explore the long-term effects of such interventions and evaluate their impact on behavioural changes, treatment adherence and clinical outcomes in diverse populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-097304</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-9-s001.pdf" id="d67e500" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP2" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-097304</object-id><label>online supplemental file 2</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-9-s002.docx" id="d67e505" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Prepublication history and additional supplemental material for this paper are available online.
