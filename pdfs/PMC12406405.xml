These two chronic airway inflammatory conditions manifest in the upper and lower airway respectively, resulting in distinctive symptoms and signs while sharing common clinical and immunological basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, more than two thirds of asthmatic patients have co-existing AR, and treating rhinosinusitis provides improved prognosis for asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The morphological and functional connection between the two anatomical units of the same respiratory tract prompted the concept of united airway diseases (UAD) in which AR and asthma share common pathophysiological mechanisms including immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity, T helper (Th) 2 cell-regulated response and elevated eosinophilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, some studies also uncovered the presence of Th1 and Th17 signatures in individuals with established severe asthma and concomitant AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although conventional pharmacotherapy (e.g. corticosteroids, antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists) could provide symptomatic relief for both upper and lower airway symptoms, none of them is with curative intent or side effects-free [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Accumulated evidence has indicated that cellular and biological treatments might offer superior therapeutic advantages to conventional pharmacotherapy.</p><p id="Par8">Stem cell-based therapy has generated tremendous attention as it offers new options for patients suffering from previously incurable diseases. For example, several preclinical and clinical trials adopted the regenerative and immunomodulatory features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for the treatment of several respiratory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the use of MSCs as therapeutics possesses several drawbacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and exosome, secreted by almost all cell types including stem cells has been posited as a safer and more versatile alternative to stem cell therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-exo) have been discovered to attenuate inflammation, modulate immune response, inhibit apoptosis, and repair damaged tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although MSC-exo has been used in managing respiratory disorders such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and COVID-19, very scarce evidence is available in airway inflammatory diseases such as AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and none in asthma. Nonetheless, exosomes can be engineered, such as drug loading and surface modification, to improve, broaden, or change their therapeutic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In our previous study, bioinformatics analysis revealed that exosomes treated nasal mucosal tissues demonstrated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway to be predominantly activated during exosomal treatment for AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], thereby suggesting the potential of using PPAR-&#947; agonists, such as Pioglitazone (PIO), to further strengthen the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of MSC-exos.</p><p id="Par9">Compared to systemic administration, in which exosomes might be rapidly cleared from blood circulation and accumulate in the metabolic organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], local delivery of exosomes can improve their organ-specific enrichment, such as intranasal drops for the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and nebulized inhalation for the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recently, biomaterials have been used to protect, assist, and augment locally delivered stem cell-derived exosomes to maximize their therapeutic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The biomaterials available for exosome delivery are generally characterized according to their composition (e.g., hyaluronic acid, gelatin methacrylate), morphology (e.g., microneedle, nanoparticle), and stimuli-response (e.g., pH, temperature, protein), thereby allowing disease-specific customization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) has been proven as an excellent carrier of drugs and proteins for the treatment of various diseases because of its outstanding biodegradability and biocompatibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We recently fabricated a PLGA platform that could efficiently encapsulate and release MSC-exos in the murine nasal cavity in a sustained manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Specifically, after delineating the in vivo retention time and in vitro exosome release, exosome-encapsulating PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) in 800&#160;nm size with 40&#160;&#181;g/mg exosome cargo were determined to be most suitable for the treatment of allergic respiratory disease and used thereafter.</p><p id="Par10">We are the first group to develop a novel pharmaco-exosomal immunotherapy for united airway diseases. We successfully fabricated PLGA-exo-PIO as an excellent nanoscale drug delivery vehicle with good biocompatibility, longer retention, potent cellular uptake, and targeted therapy to locally deliver the exosomes and PIO for effective treatment of AR and asthma. The results of in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that PLGA-exo-PIO exhibits excellent therapeutic capability to attenuate the UADs symptoms by enhancing the anti-inflammatory responses. Further mechanistic exploration of PLGA-exo-PIO treatment revealed multiple signaling pathways such as the Notch cascade and NF-kB cascade.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture and mice</title><p id="Par11">We purchased six to eight-week-old male Balb/c mice from Vital River Animal Technology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China), and the mice were housed in specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions and quarantined for one week under standard laboratory conditions (24&#160;&#176;C room temperature, 45%-55% air humidity, and a 12:12&#160;h light/dark cycle).

These data highlighted intranasal administration of PLGA-exo-PIO mediates safe, highly efficient cargo delivery and achieves targeted immunotherapy in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Bioinformatic trend analysis revealed consistent functional changes during RNA sequencing of nasal tissue and lung tissue</title><p id="Par57">After collecting nasal and lung tissues from the NC, PC, and PLGA-exo-PIO groups, we performed bulk-RNA sequencing and detected similar trends in RNA transcription (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A <bold>&amp; B</bold>). Upon comparing nasal and lung tissue, our sequencing results showed upregulation of leukocyte migration, response to chemokine, and oxidative stress-related GO terms genes in AR and asthma mice before treatment. After treatment, the genes of GO terms related to neurotransmitter transport were universally upregulated in the PLGA-exo-PIO group, partially elucidating PLGA-exo-PIO&#8217;s therapeutic effects on AR and asthma. Venn diagrams showed that after treatment, several genes were consistently upregulated in cilium organization and microtubule bundle formation in the nasal and lung tissues (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C), while genes in immunoglobulin-mediated immune response and cytokine-mediated signaling pathway were down-regulated in NT and LT of treatment groups (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D). These up- and down-regulated GO-enriched nodes were further analyzed (Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>A-F) demonstrating specific therapeutic effect of PLGA-exo-PIO in aspects such as functional enhancement of respiratory epithelium and suppression of inflammation.</p><p id="Par58">Focusing on up-regulated enrichment nodes in PLGA-exo-PIO group, bar graphs showed GO enrichment secondary functions of up-regulated genes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E). Enrichment circle plots and network diagrams showed upregulated genes focusing on cilium organization, cilium assembly, microtubule bundle formation entries (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>G). Hierarchical clustering of enriched terms performed by treeplot dendrograms revealed that PLGA-exo-PIO improved the function of cilium assembly basal body and postsynaptic active membrane zone (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>G). In contrast, up-regulated genes in the PC group were enriched for biological functions such as immunoglobulin-mediated immune response, lymphocyte-mediated immunity, tumor necrosis factor superfamily cytokine production function, and clustered in complement chemokine activation biotic, tumor necrosis factor cytokine, and adaptive mediated immunity immunoglobulin (Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>H-J). Together, the data from RNA sequencing of NT and LT showed consistent alterations in biological functions, thereby exploring the molecular mechanism of the therapeutic potential of PLGA-exo-PIO for united airway diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Bioinformatic enrichment analysis focused on the effector signaling pathways of PLGA-exo-PIO treatment of AR and asthma</title><p id="Par59">The volcano plots showed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pre-treatment (AR&#8201;+&#8201;asthma mice) and post-treatment (PLGA-exo-PIO) in the nasal tissue and lung tissue (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A <bold>&amp; B</bold>). KEGG enrichment analysis was performed to reveal the potential mechanism of PLGA-exo-PIO treatment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C and D). We found that fatty acid metabolism, axon guidance, and the PPAR signaling pathway were upregulated in the nasal tissue, and the leukocyte migration, TNF signaling pathway, and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway were downregulated (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>A &amp; <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>B). In the lung tissue, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, asthma-related pathway, and phospholipase D signaling pathway were upregulated, while the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway were downregulated (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>C &amp; <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>D). Collectively, these results suggested that PLGA-exo-PIO treatment shares common signaling pathway characteristics in AR and asthma. Further in-depth verification using GSEA (Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>E &amp; <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>F) revealed few positive regulatory pathways, such as olfactory transduction, the Notch signaling pathway, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, may play a potent role in the PLGA-exo-PIO treatment (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E, F, I <bold>&amp; J</bold>). In addition, several negative regulatory pathways, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, oxidative phosphorylation, and complement and coagulation cascades (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>G, H, K <bold>&amp; L</bold>), may explain the changes in immune cell and cytokine profiles after PLGA-exo-PIO treatment. <italic toggle="yes">TNFAIP3</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> PTGS2</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> IL-6</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">CXCL2</italic> genes were significantly upregulated in the NF-&#954;B pathway, whereas <italic toggle="yes">CDKN1A</italic> gene was downregulated, and <italic toggle="yes">GATA3</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> Notch 4</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MFNG</italic> genes were upregulated in the Notch pathway.

Firstly, stem cell-derived exosome therapy might be superior to stem cell therapy, as it avoids inevitable limitations such as infusion toxicity, immunogenicity, tumorigenic potentials, and ethical issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Exosomes have been regarded as miniature versions of their parental cells, partially because exosomes from a certain cell type carry cell-specific or unique sets of biomolecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. For example, the MSC-derived exosomes used in our study, irrespective of the modality of their delivery, have successfully demonstrated anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in a preclinical model without exhibiting the disadvantages their cellular counterparts present. Secondly, although MSC-exo has been preclinically used in the treatment of respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], much less evidence is available in airway inflammatory disorders such as AR or asthma. Yu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and Tan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] used human adipose tissue and umbilical cord as tissue source for MSC-exo treatment of AR, respectively. Du et al. demonstrated a similar immunosuppressive effect on Tregs in asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, these studies were all single disease-oriented and none of them focused on AR and asthma as UADs. Lastly, in our very recent study in stem cell-derived exosomal therapy for rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], multiomic analysis identified the PPAR pathway as a major molecular mechanism. PPARs, including PPAR-&#945;, PPAR-&#946;/&#948;, and PPAR-&#947;, are a family of ligand-activated transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]<sup>,</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The therapeutic potential of PPAR-&#947; agonists for negative regulation of mast cell maturation, attenuation of inflammation in allergic airway disease, and remodeling of mucus hypersecretion have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Future research could adopt other exosome-based drug delivery and tissue targeting as novel strategies to strengthen the therapeutic effects of MSC-exo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par61">Our findings support that PLGA nanoparticles could not only efficiently encapsulate exosomes but also sustainably deliver them in the nasal cavities and lungs. Firstly, compared to systemic venous administration, local delivery of exosomes might provide a prolonged therapeutic effect. In terms of MSC-exo treatment of AR, Yu&#8217;s team delivered exosomes through tail vein injection which might face rapid clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], whereas Tan&#8217;s team did so using PLGA encapsulation which facilitated intranasal retention longer than 96&#160;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Based on our last project, current work extended PLGA-facilitated local exosome delivery from nasal cavity to lungs, thereby covering almost the entire respiratory tract. Another potential advantage of PLGA over venous delivery is that it might reduce the number of exosomes needed to reach the same degree of therapeutic effect. Secondly, the choice of biomaterials used for local delivery of exosomes depends on the pathological context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In terms of airway delivery, several crucial properties support PLGA particles as an ideal platform for immunotherapy, such as FDA and EMA approval for mucosal and parental administrations, complete degradation, minimal toxicity, high bioavailability, and controlled release of loaded cargo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. As a result, PLGA-based micro/nanoparticles have been exploited as promising delivery vehicles for the treatment of respiratory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, we are the first to use PLGA nanoparticles in multiple airway diseases simultaneously. Lastly, as one of the key advantages of PLGA system, drug loadability and modifiability make them suitable for the delivery of various drugs such as corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone), neurotrophins (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and anti-cancer medications (e.g., oxaliplatin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In addition, Andr&#233; et al. adopted a combined approach using cell and drug delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. For the first time, we used PLGA nanoparticles to load both medication and cell-derived exosomes. Future work could focus on optimizing the synthesis method for cargo-loaded PLGA micro/nanoparticles toward an improved delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p id="Par62">Our findings support that both upper and lower airway diseases in the same individual could be managed using PIO-supplemented MSC-exo. Firstly, conventional therapies for UADs possess inevitable limitations. Although corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists could provide symptomatic relief, their administration might be complicated (e.g., intranasal spray for AR and inhalation for asthma) and thus laborious for the patients. On the other hand, although allergen immunotherapy might be more radical than pharmacotherapy, it is time-consuming and might elicit life-threatening anaphylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Our single-modality approach proved to be simplified, rapid, and safe for anatomical units at two different locations. Secondly, PLGA-exo-PIO treatment could regulate the Th1/Th2 balance while affecting both Tregs and Bregs. Both types of regulatory cells secrete IL-10, reduce Th2 cells, and inhibit IgE production, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of and treatment response in allergic asthma and rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, most previous studies focused on the role of Tregs while under-investigating that of Bregs. Our pharmaco-exosomal therapy could significantly boost the numbers of Tregs and Bregs, which might have a deeper impact on the mechanistic exploration of UADs. Lastly, PLGA-exo-PIO treatment could suppress the production of both eosinophils and basophils. The contemporary concept of allergy is a group of IgE-mediated diseases. However, recent theory support activated mast cells and/or basophils, other than IgE, also as mediators in sensitive patients of AR and asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This might help explain why newer therapy such as Omalizumab, a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, infrequently proves ineffective in severe patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The current study is the first to investigate the change of basophils in murine peripheral blood after exosomal treatment, which helps elucidate its cellular mechanism.</p><p id="Par63">Our bioinformatic analyses revealed overlapping molecular changes in both nasal and lung tissues after the pharmaco-exosomal therapy. Firstly, the molecular profile after sequencing appeared to be treatment-specific and disease-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. For example, KEGG enrichment analysis in our recent study of MSC-exo treatment of rhinitis revealed few potentially crucial signaling pathways such as the PPAR pathway, glycolysis pathway and AMPK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In comparison, our current study of MSC-exo-PIO treatment of AR and asthma discovered several signaling cascades that are simultaneously affected in both nasal and lung tissues, such as the downregulated NF-&#954;B pathway and TNF pathway. Secondly, the Notch pathway, as discovered in GSEA analysis, is worth further discussion and verification. The Notch cascade is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that coordinates juxtracrine cellular signaling by which a wide range of cell fate decisions in cardiac, neuronal, and immune systems are determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. More importantly, the Notch pathway is implicated in both acute allergic airway inflammation and chronic airway remodeling. For example, antigen-presenting cells used the Notch pathway to instruct T cell differentiation with Notch ligand-specific fates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], whereas Tregs inhibit sprouting angiogenesis of the airway remodeling by the Notch signaling, thereby leading to improved lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Therefore, manipulating the Notch pathway might be one of the crucial molecular mechanisms of our novel pharmaco-exosomal therapy of UADs. Future work in exosome-based airway therapy could focus on the engineering of the exosomes using Notch agonists.</p><p id="Par64">These improvements enable the PLGA-based drug delivery system with promising therapeutic effects on allergic airway diseases; however, its implications for humans still have some limitations. Additionally, before clinical trials, the donor of MSCs should be investigated for infectious or genetic diseases. In our study, we intranasally administered exosomes at a dose of 3.2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>8</sup> particles/mL, which was effective and safe in mice. Recent human clinical trials have proved that the concentration from 1.7&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>8</sup> to 4.2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>15</sup> particles/mL per kg of administered exosomes through different routes was therapeutically effective and safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The concentration of exosomes in humans needs to be calculated using the human-equivalent dose (HED), a standard allometric scaling method. This also theoretically suggests that our exosomes are safe for treatment in the human body. The heterogenicity of MSC-derived exosomes is a great challenge. A rigorous quality control system of exosomes is critical to reduce batch-to-batch variation. To tackle these challenges, recently, GMP grade MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] derived from pluripotent stem cells have been proposed as an alternative source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] for EVs products. Additionally, the acquisition of exosomes requires a large amount of cellular secretion for extraction, which might increase the treatment cost of exosomal therapy. Further studies are needed to explore the exact signaling pathways, the potential immunogenicity of repeated intranasal nanoparticle/exosome administration in humans, and the dosage of exosomes for clinical use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par65">We are the first group to develop a novel pharmaco-exosomal immunotherapy for united airway diseases. Firstly, MSC-derived exosomes supplemented by PPAR-&#947; agonist could exert anti-inflammatory effect for both allergic rhinitis and asthma in the same individual. Secondly, PLGA nanoparticles could act as a suitable vehicle for local and sustained delivery of exosomes for upper and lower airways. Thirdly, mechanistic exploration of PLGA-exo-PIO treatment revealed multiple signaling pathways such as the Notch cascade and NF-&#954;B cascade.
