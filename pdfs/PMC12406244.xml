formulation
strategies for improving the solubility and release of poorly water-soluble,
small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However,
high drug loads (DLs) in ASDs can lead to phase-separation phenomena,
resulting in eventually incomplete/collapsed API release, classically
referred to as loss of release. This study investigates the role of
the surfactant <sc>d</sc>-&#945;-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate
(Vitamin E TPGS) in mitigating this phenomenon in ASDs composed of
ritonavir and poly&#173;(vinylpyrrolidone-co-vinyl acetate) (PVPVA). As
part of the investigations, we developed an improved sampling protocol
to differentiate between ASD components molecularly dissolved and
those released as nano droplets into the aqueous medium. The results
showed that the addition of 3 wt % Vitamin E TPGS enhances release
ability up to 30 wt % DL, compared to 25 wt % for the surfactant-free
ASD. This enhancement is attributed to Vitamin E TPGS&#8217;s ability
to stabilize discrete RIT-rich domains in the ASD during phase separation.
However, at 40 wt % DL, even high Vitamin E TPGS concentrations (up
to 10 wt %) did not lead to full release of the API. This indicates
that the aforementioned stabilization mechanism failed and could be
traced back to a change in the phase separation behavior above an
upper limit of Vitamin E TPGS concentrations. This study thus provides
insights into the complex release mechanisms of high-DL ritonavir
ASDs and the critical role of surfactants such as Vitamin E TPGS.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><graphic position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="mp5c00620_0012.jpg"/></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc-graphic"><graphic id="tgr1" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="mp5c00620_0010.jpg"/></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>amorphous solid dispersion</kwd><kwd>vitamin E TPGS</kwd><kwd>release</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fnd-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AbbVie Deutschland</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry" vocab-identifier="10.13039/open_funder_registry">10.13039/100006484</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NA</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>mp5c00620</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>mp5c00620</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>production-flag-MathML-config-version</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>production-flag-journal-citation-display-style</meta-name><meta-value>acs-titles</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>production-flag-journal-date-display-style</meta-name><meta-value>dates-used-rcd-rvd-acc</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>production-flag-si-avail</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-alt-64</meta-name><meta-value>8f4286faf2653a8f440cd95e3a3eaee2b8b2f43d6e1f5ea590a9e23ad5ad496f</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Amorphous solid dispersions
(ASDs) are one of the premier pharmaceutical
formulation strategies for small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients
(APIs) with low aqueous solubility.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"/> It
is well-known that the amorphous API has a higher apparent aqueous
solubility compared to the crystalline form but tends to recrystallize
due to its thermodynamic instability. To preserve the advantages of
the amorphous state in terms of solubility, the amorphous API is dissolved
in an amorphous polymer matrix, forming an ASD. If selected correctly,
the polymer delays/hinders recrystallization of the amorphous API.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> In addition, using an ASD as a formulation technique often enhances
the release behavior compared to that of the crystalline or pure amorphous
API (if at all physically stable). For example, ASDs with the polymer
poly&#173;(vinylpyrrolidone-co-vinyl acetate) (PVPVA) showed an increased
release of the APIs ritonavir (RIT)<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> and felodipine<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"/> compared to the pure amorphous API. From a formulation
perspective, two important aspects need to be considered: (1) In terms
of bioavailability, the API should release completely (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref> A). (2) Formulations with
high drug load (DL) are desirable, as this decreases tablet size and/or
the number of tablets to achieve the required dose of the API.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>1</label><caption><p>Schematic release

the applicable DL
has an upper limit that is specific to a particular system.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" specific-use="suppress-in-print"/>
<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> Exceeding this upper DL limit leads to a loss of release (LoR) of
the API (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>B,C), meaning API release drops significantly (with only minimal
release remaining) or even collapses completely. As a subset of the
LoR, Taylor et al. introduced the term Limit of Congruency to describe
the DL at which API and Polymer no longer release congruently (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref> B).<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> For example, ASDs containing RIT and PVPVA still showed complete
release of the API in phosphate buffer (pH = 6.8, 37 &#176;C) at a
DL of 25 wt %, while at 30 wt %, DL incomplete release behavior (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>B) was observed.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"/> At even higher DLs (up to 40 wt %), the API release
collapses significantly, resulting in minimal release of both the
polymer and the API (see schematically in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>C).<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p><p>Previous
studies by other researchers and by our group showed that
LoR can be primarily attributed to two different mechanisms: (1) Rapid
crystallization of the supersaturated API from the amorphous state
or (2) liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) at the ASD&#8211;water
interface.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

gap is reached, LLPS occurs, resulting in a hydrophobic API-rich phase

</named-content> The polymer-rich
phase, having a high aqueous solubility, dissolves quickly into the
aqueous bulk phase. The dispersed API-rich phase (having a low aqueous
solubility) is only partially dissolved but is mostly released as
API-rich &#8220;fragments&#8221; into the aqueous bulk phase. These
released API-rich fragments strive for thermodynamic equilibrium with
the aqueous bulk phase. They continuously dissolve until the amorphous
solubility of the API in the aqueous bulk phase is reached ([ABP]
in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>). Once
the amorphous solubility is exceeded, LLPS occurs, resulting in API-rich
droplets ([AD] in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>) that are in thermodynamic equilibrium with the aqueous bulk
phase ([ABP] in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>

during the course of their partial dissolution into the state of API-rich

release
enhancer in RIT/PVPVA ASDs. We investigated whether increasing concentrations
of Vitamin E TPGS lead to enhanced API release in ASDs with high DL.
To achieve this, we conducted release experiments on ASD films in
water at 37 &#176;C with varying DL and polymer/surfactant ratios.
Our results demonstrate that beyond a certain concentration threshold,
increasing the amount of Vitamin E TPGS did not increase the release
of RIT from ASDs with high DLs. Additionally, we developed an improved
sampling protocol to gain further insights into the Vitamin E TPGS-assisted
release of ASDs consisting of RIT and PVPVA. Previous studies (also

pseudo ternary phase diagram for the system of RIT/PVPVA at the fixed
ratio of RIT to PVPVA 40:60 (ASD40), Vitamin E TPGS, and water. For
the first time, this diagram provides insight into the phase separation
of the quaternary system based on the phase separation observed in
binary systems. It is known that ASD40 and water exhibit an LLPS at
37 &#176;C<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"/> (see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"/>

recent investigations suggest phase separation in binary mixtures
of PVPVA and Vitamin E TPGS at Vitamin E TPGS contents higher than
7 wt %.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> As ASD40 is rich in PVPVA, we thus also
assume an LLPS in the Vitamin E TPGS/ASD40 system (see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"/>

E TPGS and water does not show an LLPS at 37 &#176;C. However, LLPS
starts occurring at 78 &#176;C.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"/> Taking
these considerations for the three binary subsystems into account,
it is plausible that the concentration regions of binary LLPS overlap/intersect
in the quaternary system, thus creating a huge concentration range
where three liquid phases exist in equilibrium (LLLPS) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"/>

and a Vitamin E TPGS-rich phase (path II in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>). As a result, the previous mechanism fails,
as the coalescence of the RIT-rich phase can no longer be inhibited
by Vitamin E TPGS (due to the formation of a Vitamin E TPGS-rich phase).
This also could explain the observation that, although PVPVA is released
at 100%, only 80% of Vitamin E TPGS is released (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>C) for the 40 wt % DL ASD containing
10 wt % Vitamin E TPGS. Thus, 20% of the Vitamin E TPGS remains in
the ASD as Vitamin E TPGS-rich phase. The phase diagram also indicates
that further increasing the TPGS content beyond this threshold (e.g.,
10 wt % Vitamin E TPGS) does not change the phase composition until
nearly the entire formulation consists of Vitamin E TPGS.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><label>4.5</label><title>Mechanism of Vitamin E TPGS-Assisted Release</title><p>Based on our release experiments and the discussions above, our

TPGS that exceeds the upper threshold.</p></caption><graphic id="gr9" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="mp5c00620_0009.jpg"/></fig><p>In Case I, the addition of an insufficient amount
of Vitamin E
TPGS cannot prevent incomplete or even collapsed RIT release. Although
Vitamin E TPGS can adsorb at the RIT-PVPVA interface during LLPS in
the ASD, the amount of Vitamin E TPGS molecules is insufficient to
stabilize discrete RIT-rich domains. Thus, the initial RIT-rich domains
coalesce almost instantaneously during LLPS in the ASD, forming a
continuous RIT-rich phase and a discrete PVPVA-rich phase. Like for
surfactant-free ASDs (see &#8242;LoR&#8242; in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Section <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec"/>
</xref>), PVPVA dissolves into the
aqueous bulk phase, while the RIT-rich phase remains as a porous layer
of the ASD. This hinders further dissolution of all components, resulting
in LoR (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>A, ASD with 3 wt % Vitamin E TPGS and 40 wt % DL).</p><p>In Case
II, the increased amount of Vitamin E TPGS molecules now
enables the stabilization of discrete RIT-rich domains during LLPS
in the ASD, hindering their coalescence. The PVPVA-rich phase dissolves
completely, and the RIT-rich phase dissolves until the amorphous solubility
of RIT in the aqueous bulk phase is reached (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>B, ASD with 3 wt % Vitamin
E TPGS and 30 wt % DL). After that, the RIT-rich phase is released
into the aqueous bulk phase in the form of RIT-rich fragments (see
&#8220;Desired release behavior&#8221; in surfactant-free ASDs, <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Section <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec"/>
</xref>). These fragments
then quickly transform into RIT-rich droplets in the aqueous bulk
phase (see <xref rid="sec3.3" ref-type="sec">Section <xref rid="sec3.3" ref-type="sec"/>
</xref> and Figure SI1, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.5c00620/suppl_file/mp5c00620_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Supporting Information</ext-link>). Thus, the addition of sufficient Vitamin E TPGS leads to the desired
complete RIT release over time.</p><p>In Case III, the amount of Vitamin
E TPGS in the ASD exceeds the
upper threshold (<xref rid="sec4.4" ref-type="sec">Section <xref rid="sec4.4" ref-type="sec"/>
</xref>). Instead of being present in one/or both of the two LLPS
phases and thus being able to adsorb at the RIT&#8211;PVPVA interface,
Vitamin E TPGS now forms a distinct third phase rich in Vitamin E
TPGS. This phase does not participate in the aforementioned stabilization
mechanism. Due to the presence of the third phase, the amount of Vitamin
E TPGS in the RIT-rich and the PVPVA-rich phases is reduced significantly
(to values that now follow Case I). This leads to an incomplete RIT
release (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>C, ASD with 10 wt % Vitamin E TPGS and 40 wt % DL). However, as the
continuous network of the RIT-rich phase is now more porous (both
the PVPVA-rich phase and Vitamin E TPGS-rich phase dissolve faster),
more RIT is released compared to the LoR observed in the Vitamin E
TPGS-free system (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>). We assume that this release behavior could also be observed
in biological systems with higher shear rates, as increased rotation
speed might accelerate the release<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"/> but
would not affect the thermodynamic equilibrium.</p><p>Summing up,
the release experiments reveal three distinct cases
for Vitamin E TPGS-assisted release in RIT/PVPVA ASDs. In a certain
concentration range, Vitamin E TPGS (Case II) stabilizes RIT-rich
domains, enabling their controlled dissolution and leading to the
desired release. In contrast, an insufficient amount of Vitamin E
TPGS (Case I) fails to stabilize discrete RIT-rich domains, leading
to their coalescence and formation of a continuous RIT-rich phase,
which hinders complete release. However, adding excessive amounts
of Vitamin E TPGS induced the formation of the third phase (Case III),
reducing its stabilizing potential within the other phases and resulting
in incomplete RIT release. The schematic phase diagram suggests that
even if further increasing the TPGS content, the phase composition
remains unchanged until nearly the entire formulation consists of
Vitamin E TPGS. Therefore, &#8220;the more Vitamin E TPGS, the better&#8221;
does not apply.</p><p>We suggest that these results can be extrapolated
to release experiments
conducted in intestinal fluids at pH 6.8, as our results are consistent
with previous investigations performed in phosphate buffer (pH = 6.8).<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"/> The presence of additional substances such as
salts in biological fluids can affect phase separation in the ASD,
which was not considered in this work. We furthermore hypothesize
that the proposed release mechanisms may also be applicable to ASDs
formulated with other APIs (e.g., the acid API indomethacin) as well
as alternative surfactants, provided that the binary systems of API/water,
polymer/surfactant, and water/surfactant exhibit phase separation,
and the API does not undergo rapid recrystallization in the ASD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this work, we developed
an easy-to-use sampling protocol to
gain detailed insight into the release behavior of ASDs to distinguish
between the released and molecularly dissolved amounts of the ASD
components. We were able to confirm the previous investigation on
the Vitamin E TPGS-assisted release behavior for RIT/PVPVA ASDs with
DLs up to 30 and 3 wt % Vitamin E TPGS. Our results suggest that Vitamin
E TPGS acts as a surface-active agent at the RIT-PVPVA interface during
LLPS. It stabilizes distinct RIT-rich phase domains, hindering their
coalescence and enabling their simultaneous release with the continuous
PVPVA-rich phase.</p><p>However, our results also reveal the limitations
of this stabilization
mechanism, as at elevated concentrations of Vitamin E TPGS (about
10 wt %), congruent release of all three components could not be achieved
for ASDs with DLs higher than 40 wt %. This suggests that beyond an
upper threshold, the surfactant is no longer able to stabilize RIT-rich
domains. As a probable reason for that, we hypothesize the formation
of a third phase rich in Vitamin E TPGS during phase separation in
the ASD. This phase behavior disrupts the stabilization mechanism
that was effective until then, leading again to incongruent and incomplete
release of RIT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
of a three-phase demixing in ASDs. Further insights into the three-phase
demixing using Raman spectroscopy will be presented in a future publication.</p><p>This study thus underscores the critical role of surfactants like
Vitamin E TPGS in optimizing ASD formulations while also highlighting
the challenges that arise at high surfactant concentrations. We showed
that for Vitamin E TPGS in Ritonavir/PVPVA ASDs, &#8220;the more
the better&#8221; does not apply and provided a mechanistic understanding
of surfactant-assisted release behavior. These insights are valuable
for the development of formulations in which optimizing API release
must be balanced with other critical factors, such as long-term stability
or manufacturability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sifile1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="mp5c00620_si_001.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><p>The authors thank Lukas Lebert for
