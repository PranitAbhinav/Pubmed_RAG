Patients commonly exhibit either progressive lymphadenopathy, extranodal disease, or both conditions, necessitating treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. DLBCL exhibits significant clinical and biological heterogeneity, with distinct genetic and molecular subtypes influencing its behavior and prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy (R-CHOP) has substantially improved survival rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], approximately 40&#8211;50% of DLBCL patients remain incurable after undergoing first-line treatment with R-CHOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These relapsed or refractory cases often have poor long-term prognoses, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="Par6">Natural compounds have gained attention in recent years for their low toxicity and broad biological activities, making them promising candidates for cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Among these, apigenin, a naturally occurring flavonoid found in various fruits, vegetables, and herbs, has demonstrated potent anti-cancer properties, including anti-proliferative, anti-migratory, and pro-apoptotic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This compound induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis in various types of tumors through the modulation of several signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Further research has revealed that apigenin can target various signaling pathways crucial for cancer development and progression, including PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK/ERK, JAK/STAT, NF-&#954;B, and Wnt/&#946;-catenin pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Notably, apigenin has demonstrated significant anticancer effects in multiple cancer types, such as lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additionally, in the treatment of breast cancer, apigenin has exhibited its unique anticancer mechanism by acting on tumor cells in a complex manner, directly inhibiting PI3K activity and simultaneously indirectly inhibiting Akt kinase activity, thereby effectively suppressing Akt function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, apigenin&#8217;s specific roles and mechanisms in DLBCL remain insufficiently explored.</p><p id="Par7">DLBCL poses unique therapeutic challenges due to its rapid proliferation, high invasive potential, and resistance to apoptotic signals. Targeting these features is critical for improving therapeutic outcomes. Apigenin&#8217;s low toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], natural origin, and multi-targeted actions provide a compelling case for its investigation as an alternative or adjunct therapy. It is worth noting that OCI-LY3 possesses highly aggressive, tumorigenic, and clinically drug-resistant characteristics and has been widely used in DLBCL research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par25">Although there is now a deeper understanding of DLBCL pathological subtypes and rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy has proven effective, many patients experience reduced treatment efficacy due to the rapid development of drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Consequently, the search for new drugs that can inhibit DLBCL continues. For instance, geniposide, an active compound derived from the traditional Chinese medicine &#8220;Zhizi,&#8221; has proven its ability to restrain DLBCL cell proliferation and promote apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Apigenin is gaining growing recognition as an agent for cancer chemoprevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This study systematically explored the anti-tumor effects of apigenin on DLBCL OCI-LY3 cells both in vitro and in vivo, revealing its potential as a novel curative agent.</p><p id="Par26">A key finding of this study was the concentration-dependent inhibition of OCI-LY3 cell proliferation by apigenin. The MTT assay revealed noticeable reductions in cell viability at concentrations of 40 &#181;mol/L and 80 &#181;mol/L. These results align with previous studies on apigenin in solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], suggesting its ability to interfere with cell cycle progression by modulating cyclin-dependent kinases and other regulatory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the context of DLBCL, where rapid proliferation is a hallmark of disease progression, apigenin&#8217;s anti-proliferative effects are particularly relevant. In addition to inhibiting proliferation, apigenin markedly impaired the migration and invasion abilities of OCI-LY3 cells. Transwell assays revealed dose-dependent reductions in both migration and invasion, highlighting apigenin&#8217;s potential to interfere with metastatic processes. This effect has been demonstrated in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These effects may be mediated through the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-2 and MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which are critical for extracellular matrix degradation and tumor cell dissemination. Given that DLBCL frequently involves extranodal metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], the ability of apigenin to suppress metastatic behavior represents a promising avenue for future therapeutic development.</p><p id="Par27">Apigenin&#8217;s pro-apoptotic activity was another critical finding. Flow cytometry showed notable increases in apoptosis rates in OCI-LY3 cells following apigenin treatment, with the strongest effects observed at 80 &#181;mol/L. Western blot analysis further confirmed the upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved Caspase-3, along with the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. These results suggest that apigenin promotes apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, consistent with its reported mechanisms in other relative research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. As resistance to apoptosis is a major obstacle in DLBCL treatment, apigenin&#8217;s ability to overcome this resistance provides a compelling rationale for its inclusion in therapeutic regimens. What&#8217;s more, the in vivo experiments further validated the anti-tumor efficacy of apigenin, which has been demonstrated in a prior study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Mice treated with apigenin exhibited significantly reduced tumor volumes and weights. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreased Ki-67 expression, indicating reduced proliferative activity within the tumor tissues. These findings reinforce the translational potential of apigenin from in vitro observations to in vivo models, suggesting that it may serve as an effective therapeutic agent for DLBCL.</p><p id="Par28">In conclusion, this study highlights the remarkable anti-tumor activity of apigenin in DLBCL, demonstrating its ability to inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion while inducing apoptosis of OCI-LY3 cells and suppressing tumor growth. These findings provide strong evidence supporting apigenin&#8217;s capacity as a curative option for DLBCL and offer valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying apigenin&#8217;s anti-lymphoma effects and its potential clinical applications. Future studies with larger sample sizes are essential to validate these findings and to establish the clinical relevance of apigenin in lymphoma therapy. By addressing these gaps, apigenin could become a valuable addition to the therapeutic arsenal against DLBCL.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to give our sincere gratitude to the reviewers for their constructive comments.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>P.
