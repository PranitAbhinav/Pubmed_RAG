Yet in 2022, TB was the second leading cause of death from a single infectious agent worldwide, with 7.5&#8201;million people newly diagnosed with TB, making it the highest number since the mid-1990s.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> China is one of 30 high TB burden countries, with TB cases accounting for 7.1% of the world.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> TB remains a major global health problem, especially in countries with a low Socio-demographic Index.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>Health promotion is &#8216;the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve their health&#8217;.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Health promoting behaviours (HPB) are crucial for maintaining and improving health.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> They ultimately aim to achieve positive health outcomes for the individual and, when integrated into a healthy lifestyle, lead to improved functioning and quality of life.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Based on Pender&#8217;s Health Promotion Model, HPB is conceptualised in six dimensions: health responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, interpersonal relations, spiritual growth and stress management.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> TB is a disease that is closely related to behavioural and environmental factors, such as smoking, alcohol abuse and dependency, malnutrition, crowding and indoor air pollution.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Engaging in HPB, such as adhering to medication regimens, eating a balanced diet, avoiding alcohol and tobacco and practicing good hygiene, can greatly improve treatment outcomes and prevent the development of drug-resistant TB strains.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> By prioritising HPB, patients with TB can recover more effectively and enhance their overall well-being. However, little is known about the underlying patterns of interactions behind HPB in patients with TB and the most effective ways to intervene.</p><p>Patients with TB usually suffer not only from fatigue, weight loss and night sweats,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> but also from depression, anxiety, isolation and a sense of hopelessness.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> In addition, they encounter challenges such as medication side effects, adherence to treatment and risk of drug resistance.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> All of these create a wide range of unmet supportive care needs (SCN).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> SCN refer to the various assistance and services required by an individual to cope with the impacts of disease diagnosis, treatment, relief and deterioration, encompassing physical, emotional, social, psychological, spiritual, informational and practical needs.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Moreover, patient-centred care, which is the first pillar of the WHO&#8217;s End TB Strategy, calls for the diverse and unique needs of each patient.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The initial step in implementing health promotion is to assess the patient&#8217;s needs for health promoting activities. Understanding patients&#8217; needs, especially their SCN, enables better health promotion interventions, which in turn lead to a higher quality of life.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p>Health locus of control (HLC) refers to people&#8217; beliefs that their health is or is not determined by their behaviours.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> People attribute their health outcomes to either internal or external sources. People with a higher internal HLC believe that their behaviour determines their health, whereas people with a stronger external HLC believe that their health is controlled by chance, or other people. These differences arise from people&#8217;s belief about the causes and consequences of the events they have experienced. HLC is significantly related to patients&#8217; needs. A higher level of internal HLC and a lower level of external HLC were associated with fewer unmet needs.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Researchers also identified that patients with cancer with a higher level of external HLC were more likely to use information sources and have additional information needs. In contrast, no association was found between internal HLC and information needs.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref></p><p>HLC also plays a crucial role to understand or predict patients&#8217; HPB. There are generally three types of HLC: internal (IHLC), chance (CHLC) and powerful others (PHLC).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> IHLC refers to the belief that health outcomes are primarily determined by one&#8217;s own behaviours. In the context of TB, patients with high IHLC are more likely to take responsibility for disease management, adhere to medication and adopt infection control measures. CHLC represents the belief that health is largely governed by fate, luck or other uncontrollable forces. Among patients with TB, a strong CHLC may lead to fatalism and reduced engagement in treatment, potentially compromising outcomes. PHLC reflects the belief that health is significantly influenced by powerful others, particularly healthcare professionals or family members. Patients with TB who have high PHLC may rely heavily on doctors or nurses for guidance and may demonstrate good adherence when strong support from healthcare providers is present.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Previous research has found that HPB was positively associated with IHLC and PHLC, while CHLC had negative or no relationship with HPB.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21 22</sup></xref> In addition, perceived control of health is also considered as a cognitive-perceptual factor to predict health behaviours in the original Health Promotion Model.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>To date, there have been limited studies examining the mediating factors between needs of patients with TB and HPB. Even though the HLC has been investigated and found to be associated with both HPB and patient needs, the role of HLC in the relationship remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between HLC, SCN and HPB, especially to determine whether HLC and SCN are associated with HPB and whether HLC mediates the relationship between SCN and HPB. The proposed parallel mediation model for hypothesis testing was presented in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>.

We first chose three TB-designated hospitals in Xi&#8217;an, which were willing to collaborate and had the operational capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic. They were located in different administrative districts of Xi&#8217;an, and were considered representative of the 17 TB-designated hospitals in the city. Then, eligible patients were consecutively recruited from these participating hospitals from March to May 2020. They were approached during their clinical visits or inpatient treatment. Patients were included if they were: (1) diagnosed with pulmonary TB; (2) aged 18 years or above; (3) currently receiving anti-TB treatment; (4) able to read, write and communicate.

The trained nurses approached the potential participants face-to-face and explained the aim, method and procedure of this study. After obtaining verbal consent from the patients, the trained nurses asked the patients to scan the QR code and carefully read the instructions about the detailed information of this survey. Then, if the patients agreed to proceed, they would give digital informed consent and complete the questionnaire on site.

Both IHLC and CHLC acted as mediators between SCN and HPB, while PHLC did not.</p><p>The current findings showed that patients with TB who had high levels of SCN performed more poorly on the HPB. High levels of SCN suggested that patients lacked sufficient resource and support to cope with and adapt to their current disease situation. Such unmet needs are often accompanied by psychological distress, including depression and anxiety, which can undermine patients&#8217; self-efficacy in managing their condition and reduce their motivation to engage in HPB.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In addition, patients with high levels of SCN often experience inadequate support from family, friends or healthcare providers.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Social support is a critical facilitator of healthy behaviours&#8212;for example, through shared physical activity or medication reminders&#8212;and its absence can further hinder patients&#8217; adherence to HPB.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Moreover, higher SCN levels are commonly linked to poorer quality of life,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> which can serve as a significant barrier to initiating and maintaining HPB.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p>Patients with TB who had lower SCN levels were more likely to have stronger IHLC, weaker PHLC and CHLC, which was consistent with a previous study of patients with asthma.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> However, the unmet needs of patients with Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) were positively related to IHLC, as well as PHLC which included doctor HLC and other people HLC.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> As PD progresses, the patients gradually lose independence in daily activities and control over the disease, which undermines their IHLC. When patients with PD report more unmet needs, it means that they are actively coping with their disease and regaining a sense of control, an indication of an increase in IHLC. In comparison, patients with TB or asthma who had higher IHLC would improve their health status through their own actions and efforts, resulting in lower needs. This finding indicated that patients&#8217; health beliefs may be influenced and shaped by their experience of illness. Moreover, these beliefs about health subsequently influenced their needs. For patients with strong IHLC, adequate information and support should be provided to guide their health behaviours. Conversely, for patients with strong external HLC, healthcare professionals should be more involved in the disease management and help to build their confidence in controlling the disease.</p><p>Moreover, HPB was positively related to IHLC and negatively associated with CHLC. PHLC had a positive but not significant correlation with HPB.

Another multicentre study showed both PHLC and IHLC positively predicted the health behaviours of organ transplant recipients, while CHLC had a positive but not significant relationship with health behaviours.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> Therefore, IHLC were believed to be a positive predictor of health outcomes, which was also consistent with theoretical assumption.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> As to external HLC, it may have either positive or negative effects. In our study, patients with TB had a higher CHLC, which may be related to the complex process and unpredictable prognosis of the disease. This led to a strong negative stress response in the patients, resulting in a low level of their HPB.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> Additionally, the fact that PHLC was not significantly correlated with HPB may be due to insufficient mobilisation of individual initiative. Further research could explore the conditions under which external HLC has a positive effect, and use this information to guide the development of HLC-related interventions.</p><p>The results showed that IHLC and CHLC partially mediated the relationship between SCN and HPB of patients with TB. HLC is a personality trait that can be changed through life experience, education and therapy.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> A randomized controlled trial found that an educational intervention reduced CHLC and improved IHLC, leading to improved mental health and prevention of postpartum depression in mothers in Iran.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Also, the behavioural therapy was found to reduce PHLC, and increase IHLC among patients with panic disorder and/or agoraphobia.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> Therefore, healthcare providers should pay more attention to health beliefs of patients with TB and select appropriate methods to provide support and guidance, ultimately facilitating the implementation of HPB. Finally, although the mediating effect of PHLC was not significant in this study, the sign reversal phenomenon suggested that PHLC may have a suppression effect on the relationship between SCN and HPB. Future studies should thoroughly explore the role of healthcare professionals in the formation of patients&#8217; health behaviours and identify the optimal intervention timing in doctor/nurse&#8211;patient interactions.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>The findings suggested SCN had a negative influence on HPB through IHLC and CHLC. Therefore, the following recommendations are proposed to improve HPB. First, a high level of SCN was associated with poor HPB among patients with TB. Healthcare providers should identify patients&#8217; unmet needs in a timely manner and provide support and guidance to create conditions for the implementation of HPB. Second, HLC is a modifiable psychological trait and a predictor of HPB in patients with TB. On the one hand, interventions targeting HLC could improve IHLC and other health-related outcomes.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> On the other hand, adopting appropriate strategies for patients with different types of HLC may promote the progress in the implementation of HPB. Finally, whether PHLC has a positive relationship with health-related outcomes is still unknown and controversial. Further research is needed to find out the underlying mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, participants were recruited from three TB-designated hospitals in Xi&#8217;an, using a convenience sample. Although the current sample size met the requirements for statistical analysis, the representativeness of the sample was limited, which affects the generalisability of our findings. In the future, multicentre studies should be conducted to validate these results. Second, we cannot determine causal relationships between variables due to the nature of a cross-sectional study. Cohort studies should be considered for future research. Third, due to the anonymous design and lack of follow-up mechanisms, we were unable to collect reasons for questionnaire non-completion. This limited our ability to assess potential barriers to participation. Future studies should consider capturing this information.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated that HLC mediated the relationship between SCN and HPB among patients with TB. IHLC and CHLC acted as mediators between SCN and HPB, while PHLC did not. This study offered a new insight into understanding the relationship between needs and health behaviours by introducing the concept of HLC. Considering that HLC was a modifiable variable, future interventions targeting HLC could be implemented to fulfil the unmet needs and promote health behaviours of patients with TB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-092267</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s001.docx" id="d67e1005" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all the participants for their kind support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Prepub:</bold> Prepublication history and additional supplemental material for this paper are available online.
