The direction of phloem transport is determined by the positional relationship between sources and sinks and by vascular connections. Although aspects of phloem transport have been studied, a comprehensive understanding remains lacking. Here, we used soybean as a model system to investigate the translocation pathways and destinations of photosynthates using autoradiography with &#185;&#8308;C-labeled sucrose and fluorescent imaging with carboxyfluorescein (CF), a known phloem tracer. Soybean exhibits simple phyllotaxy, with alternate trifoliate leaves arranged oppositely along the stem. Applying &#185;&#8308;C-sucrose to mature leaves revealed that young developing leaves received photosynthates from source leaves on both sides of the stem. To visualize pathways, &#185;&#8308;C-sucrose and carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) were applied to sequential source leaves. Signals from &#185;&#8308;C and CF in the stem's vascular bundles showed no overlap, indicating distinct transport pathways. Additionally, when &#185;&#8308;C-sucrose was applied separately to the left and right halves of a single mature leaf, it was followed corresponding sides to the sink leaves. These findings demonstrate that photosynthates are delivered to sink tissues via multiple, well-compartmentalized phloem pathways, providing new insight into the spatial organization of phloem transport.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Autoradiography</kwd><kwd>soybean</kwd><kwd>photosynthate</kwd><kwd>phloem</kwd><kwd>translocation</kwd></kwd-group><support-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="open-funder-registry">10.13039/501100001691</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP24H00499</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>F-REI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPFR25040101</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP24H00499, and F-REI (JPFR25040101).</funding-statement></funding-group></support-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="22"/><page-count count="0"/><word-count count="5865"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" disp-level="1" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vascular tissues are essential for the transport of water and nutrients in plants. The primary components of vascular tissues are xylem and phloem. Xylem is responsible for the unidirectional transport of water and dissolved minerals from roots to leaves. In contrast, phloem transports metabolic products, amino acids, hormones, ions, mRNAs, and various other substances. Among these, the most studied are the photosynthates, which are translocated from mature source leaves to developing sink organs. Mature leaves, which produce more photosynthates than their require, act as sources, exporting the surplus to nutrient-demanding sinks for growth and maturation. Unlike xylem transport, phloem transport is bidirectional and depends on the relative positions of source and sink organs. Downward transport occurs from upper sources to lower sinks, and upward transport occurs from lower sources to upper sinks. In addition, the distance between source and sink influences allocation patterns: lower sources preferentially supply nearby lower sinks, and upper sources preferentially supply nearby upper sinks.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><p>The arrangement of leaves on the stem, known as phyllotaxis, is closely related to vascular connections and determines the destinations of photosynthates.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The relationship between phyllotaxis and source-sink translocation patterns has been reported in model plants such as Arabidopsis<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and tobacco,<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> as well as in non-model plants such as sour cherry.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In tomato, detailed studies have been reported on phyllotaxis, vascular connections, and their relationship to photosynthate translocation to fruits.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> These studies have shown that photosynthates translocated from a given source leaf are preferentially delivered to sink organs located on the same side of the stem. However, these analyses have mostly focused on unidirectional, upward translocation from a single lower source leaf to upper sinks. The mechanism underlying bidirectional translocation, and how multiple source leaves contribute to or coordinate this process, remains largely unresolved. In addition, although translocation pathways have been inferred from phyllotaxis, the actual pathways have not been clearly identified in most species.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to improve our understanding of comprehensive phloem transport by investigating the translocation pathways, directions and destinations of photosynthates using soybean plants. Soybean (<italic toggle="yes">Glycine max</italic>, Fabaceae family), an annual dicotyledonous plant, exhibits simple phyllotaxy. In the initial stages of development, the soybean plant forms a pair of cotyledons, followed by a pair of primary leaves (PL) arranged at right angles to the cotyledons. Subsequently, trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three leaflets, develop in sequence, alternating and positioned perpendicularly to the PL, each opening at an angle of 180&#176;.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> These trifoliate leaves are numbered sequentially in the order in which they emerge, and are referred to as L1, L2, L3, and so on. Leaves at positions <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>, n&#8201;+&#8201;2, and n&#8201;+&#8201;4 are arranged on the opposite side of the stem relative to those at positions n&#8201;+&#8201;1, n&#8201;+&#8201;3, and n&#8201;+&#8201;5. To examine phloem translocation, <sup>14</sup>C-sucrose and 5&#8242;(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) were applied to source leaves at different positions in the same plant, and their distribution in the stem was visually analyzed. CFDA is widely used as a phloem-mobile tracer, as its fluorescent product, carboxyfluorescein (CF), moves symplastically and remains confined to the phloem region.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Notably, we uncovered distinct and compartmentalized phloem transport pathways depending on whether the source leaves were positioned on opposite sides of the stem or whether the left or right half of a single leaf was used. Based on these findings, we propose a more refined model of phloem transport and unloading than those inferred from previous observations.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="s0002-s2001"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Seeds of soybean (Glycine max. cv. Kosuzu) (Sato Masayuki Seed Company, Iwate, Japan) were sown on moist vermiculite and germinated in the dark at 27&#176;C. The germinated seedlings were then transferred to 1/2 Hoagland hydroponic solution. The plants were grown under a 16&#8201;h light/8&#8201;h dark cycle (280&#8201;&#956;mol m<sup>&#8722;2</sup> s <sup>&#8722;1</sup>) at 27&#176;C. The hydroponic solution was refreshed every week, and the plants were hydroponically cultivated for 8 to 14&#8201;d. To maintain experimental consistency, plant samples were selected based on their growth stage rather than the number of days of culture. To investigate the destination of photosynthate, we focused on sink leaves. In cases where L2 was expanding, the developmental state of L3 was used as an indicator. We distinguished between the folded and unfolding states of L3, and referred to the conditions as &#8220;L2-expanding&#8221; and &#8220;L3-unfolding&#8221;.

The sections were cleaned of exudates and wrapped between a 1.2&#8201;&#956;m thick polyphenylene sulphide film and cryofilm (Cryofilm Type 2C, Leica) to prevent drying and radioisotope contamination. These sections were then exposed to a high-sensitive imaging plate (BAS-TR2040, FUJIFILLM) within a cassette at &#8722;80&#176;C for 9 to 14&#8201;d, depending on the <sup>14</sup>C activity.

To support the understanding of signal distributions, each image in the main stem section was set with the L1 petiole connecting to the left, and the signal around the cambium was captured in a 360&#176; clockwise direction starting from the 12:00 position. The signal intensities of <sup>14</sup>C and CF are expressed as relative values ranging from 0 to 1. Signal differences represent the CF intensity minus the <sup>14</sup>C intensity, ranging from &#8722;1 to 1. The signal differences will be close to 0 throughout if the distributions of the <sup>14</sup>C and CF intensities match.

Radioisotope tracing has a long history in the analysis of phloem translocation. Biddulph and Cory investigated the translocation pathways from different leaf positions in red kidney bean seedlings by supplying <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> to L1 and NaH<sub>2</sub><sup>32</sup>PO<sub>4</sub> to L2, detecting radioisotope activity at the internode between L1 and L2.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> However, in their experiments, the signals from <sup>14</sup>C and <sup>32</sup><italic toggle="yes">P</italic> could not be clearly distinguished. Later, using separate applications of <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> to either L1 or L2, they found that different sets of vascular bundles were involved in translocation from each leaf.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> In the present study, we successfully extended these findings by directly visualizing the dual-labeled pathways in cross-sections of the same sample (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note, however, that CF was found to be unsuitable for analyzing long-distance translocation in well-developed plants. When soybean had reached a stage where L3 was more than 80% expanded, CF signals from L3 and <sup>14</sup>C signals from L1 could not be clearly observed in the same section. Because CF is mainly transported via simple diffusion, its movement is limited to nearby tissues and becomes significantly diluted as the plant grows and internodes elongate, making it increasingly difficult to detect in distal tissues. On the other hand, at this developmental stage, <sup>14</sup>C-sucrose applied to L1 was predominantly translocated downwards rather than upward. This is because the lower sink organs, such as the roots, are spatially closer to L1 than the upper sinks like the shoot apex or young leaves. As a result of both the limited transport range of CF and the downward bias in <sup>14</sup>C translocation, it was not possible to obtain a section in which both CF and <sup>14</sup>C signals were clearly detected. This detailed comparing analysis was possible because the experiments were conducted during the early stage of vegetative growth.</p><p>Near the shoot apex, CF signals were restricted to the phloem, whereas <sup>14</sup>C signals were also detected in the xylem, and epidermis in addition to phloem. Since CF moves symplastically through plasmodesmata,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> whereas <sup>14</sup>C can be unloaded through additional pathways beyond plasmodesmata. Similar <sup>14</sup>C distribution in the xylem of young stems has been reported following <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> application to source leaves.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203; In contrast, in the internodes between mature leaves, <sup>14</sup>C was primarily observed in the regions corresponding to phloem and/or cambium (<xref rid="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005" ref-type="fig">Figures 2&#8211;5</xref>). Occasionally, <sup>14</sup>C signals were also detected in the phloem fibers (<xref rid="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005" ref-type="fig">Figures 2&#8211;5</xref>), which are structural support tissues. These results suggest that, while the phloem serves as the main conduit for long-distance translocation, the stem may also unload photosynthates for its own growth and structural maintenance. Notably, the <sup>14</sup>C signal peaks were slightly broader than those of CF (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c-ii</xref> and <xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">v</xref>), indicating lateral movement of photosynthates after unloading.</p><p>To understand where photosynthates are distributed throughout the plant, the destination of photosynthates from source leaves located on opposite sides of the stem was investigated (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We found that both L1 and L2 applied photosynthates to the same sink leaves, L3 and L4. Interestingly, weak <sup>14</sup>C activity was detected in the roots only when <sup>14</sup>C-sucrose was added to L1. This is likely because the roots acts as weak sinks compared to young immature leaves, and L1 is anatomically closer to the roots than L2. Among the sinks, L4 exhibited higher <sup>14</sup>C activity than L3, indicating greater sink strength.</p><p>Cross-section imaging revealed that photosynthates from source leaves on opposite sides of the stem were translocated through distinct phloem pathways, utilizing alternating sectors among the six divided vascular regions in the stem (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>, <xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This is likely due to the anatomical structure in which each vascular bundle from the petiole splits into three, which then connect to vascular bundle in the stem (<xref rid="f0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Thaine et al. also reported that the leaf vasculature in soybean connect to three wide bundles that enter the stem.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Thus, leaves positioned along the same orthostichy share the same vascular bundle regions, whereas the leaves on opposite side utilize different phloem pathways (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). These results are consistent with commonly accepted model (<xref rid="f0009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9a</xref>). However, in our experimental results, L3 and L4 received photosynthates from both L1 and L2. This may be due to immaturity of vascular tissues in the upper stem where these sink leaves are located, as evidenced by broad and overlapping tracers' peaks in these regions (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figures 2 c-ii</xref>, <xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">4b-i</xref> and <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">5b-i</xref>). In young growing leaves, plasmodesmata in the major veins are gradually lost or narrowed, which hinders unloading.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> A similar process may occur in the stem, where plasmodesmata-mediated transport prominates in the younger stem. Furthermore, by organizing the vascular bundles into three distinct sectors that alternate around the stem, rather than a simple splitting them into two halves, it may be possible to share translocation pathways partially between leaves on opposite sides. Such an arrangement could enable sink leaves to receive phloem-transported materials from multiple source leaves, as indicated by the observed partial overlap in transport pathways.</p><p>Imaging analysis of stem cross sections was conducted both above and below the tracer-applied leaves. The sections above the application site revealed upward translocation toward apical sinks, while the sections below showed downward translocation toward basal sinks (e.g., roots). In both directions, the tracer signals were distributed similarly, showing three distinct intensity peaks, regardless of the translocation direction (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figures 2c-iv</xref> and <xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">v</xref>, <xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">4b-ii</xref> and <xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">iii</xref> of <sup>14</sup>C, and <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">5b-ii</xref> and <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">iii</xref> of CF). These results suggest that the same vascular bundle regions were utilized for translocation in both directions. A summary of the translocation pathways is shown in <xref rid="f0009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9b</xref>. So far, it remains unclear whether bidirectional movement occurs within the same vascular bundle via separate sieve tube or temporally alternating use of the same sieve tubes. To resolve the mechanisms, further high-resolution analyses capable of distinguishing individual sieve tubes are needed. The mechanism underlying long-distance translocation in phloem is explained by the pressure flow hypothesis, proposed by M&#252;nch,<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> where the translocation of substances is driven by osmotic pressure gradients between sources and sinks. Knoblauch et al. provide strong support for this hypothesis by measuring several parameters of sieve tube transport in morning glory, but their study focused on unidirectional flow after pruning sink tissues.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Further investigation is needed to determine how bidirectional translocation is regulated within the same vascular region, and whether distinct sieve tubes or temporal alternation are involved in accommodating flow in both directions.</p><p>A unique finding of our study is the consistent detection of left&#8211;right asymmetry in <sup>14</sup>C activity within individual leaves. Although uneven <sup>14</sup>C distribution has been reported in some species (e.g., Cucurbita pepo, sugar beet and tobacco), these studies generally described base-tip differences that were attributed to developmental gradients.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate a consistent pattern of left-right asymmetric translocation from leaves and to trace the corresponding translocation pathways. Our data so that each lateral leaflet utilizes two of the three distinct vascular regions in the stem with partial sharing between regions (<xref rid="f0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Even in the terminal leaflet, translocation from the left and right sides results in different distribution patterns within the sink leaves (<xref rid="f0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Based on these findings, we propose a model in which each leaf is functionally divided into left and right halves, each utilizing a separate vascular pathway (<xref rid="f0009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9c</xref>). This functional compartmentalization of phloem loading sites may help limit the spread of local damage or infection, thereby providing physiological robustness.</p><p>The destination of photosynthates, revealed by our experiments, is summarized in <xref rid="f0009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9d</xref>. This model is consistent with previous reports showing that specific leaves supply pods at the same and alternate nodes,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> as the stems connected to pods are already mature. However, further studies are needed to experimentally verify this pattern under the present conditions.</p><p>In Summary, our study provides deeper insights into the destinations and translocation pathways of photosynthates in soybean. Despite its simple phyllotaxy, soybean sink organs receive photosynthates from multiple sources through well-separated vascular pathways. Since phloem translocation includes not only sugars but also metabolites, amino acids, hormones, ions, and mRNAs, this work contributes to a broader understanding of plant physiology and may ultimately help improve nutrient allocation and crop productivity.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="COI-statement" disp-level="1" id="s0005"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0006"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to Masako Katsuno for assistance.
