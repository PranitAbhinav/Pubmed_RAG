An important book outlines the mental health problems that they face.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> For example, approximately, 16%&#8211;31% of college athletes experience moderate-to-severe symptoms related to depression.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Moreover, 25%&#8211;48% have moderate-to-severe anxiety-related symptoms.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 5</sup></xref> They experience depression- and anxiety-related symptoms, eating disorders,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7 8</sup></xref> obsessive&#8211;compulsive disorder,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 9</sup></xref> alcohol and substance abuse<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10 11</sup></xref> and serious mental health issues, such as suicidal ideation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Consequently, understanding these conditions and implementing management and treatment strategies to address college athletes&#8217; mental health issues is imperative.</p><p>To solve these mental health problems, it is necessary to seek appropriate help when they arise. To effectively do this, it is important to develop mental health literacy, which is defined as follows: understanding how to obtain and maintain positive mental health, understanding mental disorders and their treatments, decreasing stigma related to mental disorders and enhancing help-seeking efficacy (knowing when and where to seek help and developing competencies designed to improve one&#8217;s mental healthcare and self-management capabilities).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> A previous review focused on athletes suggested that low mental health literacy hinders the pursuit of mental health treatment.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> This includes uncertainty about whom to ask for help and difficulties in accessing support services.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Additionally, college athletes lack awareness of the available psychological support resources.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><p>Educational interventions can improve mental health knowledge and understanding,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> as well as help-seeking attitudes, as a measure for addressing this problem.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> A recent systematic review focused on sports settings suggested the importance and efficacy of introducing knowledge-based mental health programmes.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Notably, research focusing on student athletes reported that a 4-week intervention, comprising 1-hour sessions incorporating psychoeducation, group discussions and video-based education (session contents: mental health literacy, empathy towards individuals with mental health concerns, counterstereotyping and a documentary about athletes who have experienced mental illness), led to improvements in mental health literacy, attitudes towards seeking help and intentions to seek counselling.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Additionally, this study has revealed that the effects continue after a 1-month follow-up.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> A study of adolescent boys and their parents or coaches who belong to a sports club reported that the Ahead of the Game programme (the adolescents programmes: face-to-face mental health literacy workshop &#8216;Help Out a Mate&#8217; and an internet-supported resilience intervention &#8216;Your Path to Success in Sport&#8217;; the parent programme: mental health literacy regarding adolescent mental health via a 1&#8201;hour and face-to-face workshop and the coach education programme: a blended delivery model of coaches&#8217; strategies to support their players&#8217; basic psychological needs) improved their confidence to seek mental health information and their intentions to seek help from formal sources (eg, psychiatric doctor).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> The recruitment engagement approach (which both provides information about the effectiveness of mental health treatment and encourages the disclosure of problematic behaviours and motivation for intervention) may promote student athletes&#8217; willingness to participate in clinical trials more than standard recruitment (which only provides information about treatment efficacy).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Such educational interventions related to mental health have been suggested to promote the intention to seek help, behavioural intentions and actual help-seeking behaviour. For example, a study implementing the Optimum Performance Programme in Sports for college athletes showed that participants sought support more frequently than those in a general counselling service programme.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Further, the study examining the impact of structured interviews focused on mental health among collegiate athletes suggested that interventions incorporating both information about mental health and athlete-relevant themes (eg, personal goals and sport culture) tended to increase the use of psychological support services.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> These findings suggest that educational and motivational interventions for mental health may promote help-seeking behaviours among athletes. However, other studies showed no effect. One study that examined a 2-week internet-based mental health help-seeking intervention programme for young elite athletes reported no changes in attitudes, intentions or behaviours related to seeking help.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Moreover, a study of adolescent athletes showed that interventions, such as workshops, discussions and role plays, on mental health literacy had no effect on intention.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> These findings suggest that educational interventions on mental health in research targeting athletes can enhance help-seeking attitudes and intentions, although some studies have reported no significant effects or a lack of long-term impact. To ensure that student athletes struggling with mental health issues receive adequate support, it is necessary to develop tailored approaches to maximise the educational effectiveness of mental health literacy interventions.</p><p>In developing individually tailored approaches, it is essential to base them on behaviour change theories and models related to health behaviours that correspond to an individual&#8217;s ability level. Many theories and models of behaviour change related to health exist.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> The rational model may be particularly useful for developing approaches to increase mental health support seeking that are tailored to the individual. The rational model is based on &#8216;increasing a person&#8217;s knowledge will prompt a behaviour change&#8217;. Specifically, this model suggests that changes in knowledge lead to changes in attitudes, intentions and beliefs, ultimately resulting in behavioural changes.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Based on this model, the lack of accurate knowledge about mental health among college athletes may be addressed, which can facilitate the seeking of support. However, in supporting college athletes, it is also essential to consider the decisional balance construct within behaviour change theories and models. Decisional balance is a subjective assessment of the benefits and burdens associated with practising a behaviour.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Individuals actively engaged in a behaviour are more likely to evaluate its pros as outweighing its cons.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Numerous studies have reported that athletes have a stigma towards seeking help.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">1529</xref><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Further, previous literature has reported that athletes experience stronger feelings of shame (stigma) related to seeking support compared with the general population.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> For example, college athletes feel embarrassed to talk about themselves in support facilities and have concerns about prying eyes when visiting counselling services.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Accordingly, even if college athletes are knowledgeable about mental health, stigma may diminish their intention to seek help, potentially preventing them from taking action. Previous reviews have reported that even when athletes are provided with knowledge about mental health, the effects on their attitudes and intentions to seek help are small to moderate.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Further, Ojio <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>&#8217;s<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> study of rugby players reported no relationship between mental health knowledge and attitudes towards counselling behaviour for mental health problems. These findings suggest that college athletes&#8217; support-seeking behaviour may not necessarily lead to intentions to behave through knowledge acquisition. To prevent mental health issues among college athletes, it is necessary to identify the prevalence of such behavioural patterns, understand the characteristics of college athletes and develop strategies to facilitate their access to psychiatric treatment. Moreover, instead of focusing solely on knowledge, combining an individual&#8217;s knowledge with behavioural intentions to categorise their state enables a multidimensional perspective on the phenomenon of not seeking help. This study is expected to function as a foundation for future research and theoretical development on mental health support for college athletes while also facilitating a shared understanding of this issue among researchers and practitioners.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Purpose</title><p>This study focuses on psychiatric treatment that is directly linked to mental healthcare, aiming to prevent mental health problems in college athletes. We established three aims to clarify college athletes&#8217; mental illness knowledge and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment: (1) to investigate the state of mental illness knowledge (Purpose 1&#8211;1) and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment (Purpose 1&#8211;2); (2) to examine the relationship between mental illness knowledge and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment (Purpose 2) and (3) to determine the percentage of college athletes with mental illness knowledge but no intention to seek psychiatric treatment (Purpose 3).</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>Our study had two hypotheses for Purpose 1 (Purpose 1&#8211;1 and Purpose 1&#8211;2) based on a previous study. Hypothesis 1&#8211;1: college athletes have limited knowledge about mental illness. Hypothesis 1&#8211;2: many college athletes have a lesser intention to seek psychiatric treatment.</p><p>Next, our hypothesis for Purpose 2 was based on a previous study indicating that even with knowledge about mental health, individuals may not intend to seek support and counselling.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Hypothesis 2: there is a weak relationship between mental illness knowledge and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment.</p><p>Finally, our hypothesis for Purpose 3 was formulated from the perspective of the decisional balance framework in behaviour change theory. Student athletes experience stigma when seeking help, and a study of athletes reported no relationship between mental health knowledge and attitudes towards counselling for mental health issues.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Thus, Hypothesis 3 states that college athletes have a high level of knowledge about mental illness but passive intentions to seek psychiatric treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>This study targeted college students from two universities in Japan, specifically from the faculties of Health and Sports Science and the School of Health Sciences, as these students are more likely to engage in competitive sports, which may influence their awareness and attitudes towards mental health support. After their classes ended, we informed them about the study and conducted a web-based survey. A total of 516 students participated in the survey. First, we excluded participants who did not consent to this study, had extremely short response times (10&#8201;min or less) and made a mistake in their response regarding years of competitive experience. Consequently, 479 Japanese college students (92.83%; 339 men and 140&#8201;women) enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria were college students who were members of university athletic teams or members of club teams, whether affiliated with a university or not. The exclusion criteria included respondents who did not participate in sports activities, did not belong to sports clubs or societies as a hobby, had not answered the question about sports activity affiliation and were not active athletes (eg, trainers, student coaches and student managers).

This scale has been used in research involving Japanese university students.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36 37</sup></xref> The MIDUS scale comprises three factors: &#8216;treatability of illness&#8217;, &#8216;efficacy of medication&#8217; and &#8216;social recognition of illness&#8217;. This scale comprises 15 items, and items were assessed using a five-point Likert scale (0=<italic toggle="yes">strongly agree</italic>, 1=<italic toggle="yes">tend&#8201;to agree</italic>, 2=<italic toggle="yes">neither agree nor disagree</italic>, 3=<italic toggle="yes">tend&#8201;to disagree</italic> and 4=<italic toggle="yes">strongly disagree</italic>). The total MIDUS score ranged from 0 to 60. This scale demonstrated reliability and validity in a previous study: the &#8216;treatability of illness&#8217; factor &#945;=0.74; the &#8216;efficacy of medication&#8217; factor &#945;=0.73 and the &#8216;social recognition of illness&#8217; factor &#945;=0.62.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> We also examined the internal consistency of the MIDUS by calculating Cronbach&#8217;s &#945; and McDonald&#8217;s &#969; coefficients.

These findings indicate that while the &#8216;treatability of illness&#8217; and &#8216;social recognition of illness&#8217; factors exceeded the standard values, the &#8216;efficacy of medication&#8217; factor demonstrated relatively low reliability.

Participants were contacted via email. The survey required participants to load a URL or scan a QR code to access and answer questions, which took approximately 20&#8211;25&#8201;min. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the First Author&#8217;s Affiliated Organisation (No. 65, 2022).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>First, we summarised the demographic information. Second, to examine Purposes 1&#8211;1 and 1&#8211;2, we clarified the method for calculating each item&#8217;s percentage and item scores regarding mental illness knowledge (MIDUS) and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment. Third, we examined potential confounding factors among the demographic characteristics (sex, age, years of experience in the current sport, role in the respective sport and competitive level) that may influence knowledge about mental health problems and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment. The confounding factors were examined using t-tests and one-way analysis of variance. Subsequently, we used partial correlation analysis to examine the relationship between mental illness knowledge (MIDUS) and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment (Purpose 2). Finally, to determine the characteristics of college athletes, the total MIDUS scores and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment scores were used to categorise them based on two criteria (Purpose 3). First, we separated the total MIDUS scores (range: 0&#8211;60) into four groups based on equal quartile intervals: <italic toggle="yes">sufficient knowledge</italic> (46&#8211;60), <italic toggle="yes">some sufficient knowledge</italic> (31&#8211;45), <italic toggle="yes">some insufficient knowledge</italic> (16&#8211;30) and <italic toggle="yes">insufficient knowledge</italic> (0&#8211;15). The possible score ranges and classifications for each factor are provided in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental Appendix 1</xref>. Next, the scores for mental illness knowledge (MIDUS)&#8212;divided into four categories&#8212;were classified into two groups (sufficient knowledge=sufficient knowledge and some sufficient knowledge and insufficient knowledge=some insufficient knowledge and insufficient knowledge). Intention to seek psychiatric treatment (0&#8211;4 points) was categorised into two broad categories: passive behaviour (<italic toggle="yes">strongly disagree</italic> (0 point), <italic toggle="yes">tend to disagree</italic> (1 point) and <italic toggle="yes">neither agree nor disagree</italic> (2 points)) and active behaviour (<italic toggle="yes">tend to agree</italic> (3 points) and <italic toggle="yes">strongly agree</italic> (4 points)), based on the median point (2 points).</p><p>Four categorised groups were formed based on the knowledge axes of mental illness and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment: &#8216;sufficient knowledge/active behaviour (This group is knowledgeable about mental illness and active in intention to seek psychiatric treatment)&#8217;, &#8216;sufficient knowledge/passive behaviour (This group is knowledgeable about mental illness, but inactive in intention to seek psychiatric treatment)&#8217;, &#8216;insufficient knowledge/active behaviour (This group is lacking knowledge about mental illness, but active in intention to seek psychiatric treatment)&#8217; and &#8216;insufficient knowledge/passive behaviour (This group is lacking knowledge about mental illness and inactive in intention to seek psychiatric treatment)&#8217; (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2a,b</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>(a) Categories based on MIDUS and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment scores.

College athletes&#8217; knowledge did not necessarily increase their intention to seek support. A previous study on rugby players reported that mental health knowledge did not influence counselling behaviour related to mental illness.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Further, individuals with a higher tendency for depression are more likely to avoid consulting others.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Several reasons may explain this. Past studies indicate that athletes tend to worry about what others think, deny the problem and want to avoid affecting their playing or training time.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Therefore, it is necessary to explore why college athletes&#8217; knowledge of mental illness does not lead to the intention to seek psychiatric treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Categorisation based on mental illness knowledge and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment</title><p>Hypothesis 3 was supported. This study found that, among the four categories, approximately 50% of college athletes, even those with sufficient knowledge of mental illness, had passive intentions towards psychiatric treatment. The first reason for the increased knowledge of mental illness (mental health) among student athletes (eg, college student athletes) may be the heightened focus on mental health support and actions to address these issues.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Similarly, mental health issues and severe mental health problems in college athletes have been reported in various studies.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> As a measure, Canada,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> the UK,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> Australia<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> and other countries have investigated the mental health of athletes and established mental health support facilities specifically for them. Further, there are international policy approaches to mental health awareness programmes in sports,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> and the International Olympic Committee has developed mental health assessments and toolkits.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45 46</sup></xref> Moreover, athletes have recently conducted mental health awareness activities through social media, mass media and other channels. There has been an increase in evaluation tools, assessments, facilities and other opportunities for disseminating information to the public. This factor made it easier for college athletes to access mental health resources.</p><p>Moreover, regarding passivity towards the intention to seek psychiatric treatment, Nakamura <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> noted privacy concerns and high resistance. College athletes have passive intentions to seek psychiatric treatment. Further, individualised approaches to promote mental health support-seeking behaviour may be overlooked.</p><p>Moreover, possessing a certain level of mental illness knowledge did not lead to an intention to seek psychiatric treatment, with approximately 50% of college athletes categorised as &#8216;sufficient knowledge/passive behaviour&#8217;. This phenomenon may be explained by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB)<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> and the Theory of Decisional Balance (a subjective estimate of the benefits and burdens associated with practising a behaviour)<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28 48</sup></xref> in the Transtheoretical Model.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> First, from the perspective of the TPB, several key mechanisms can be considered. According to the TPB, behavioural intentions are determined by attitudes towards the behaviour, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control. These intentions are considered the most direct predictors of actual behaviour. Therefore, whether behavioural intentions lead to actual behaviour may depend on various factors such as perceived feasibility, fear of being judged by others and stigma. There are several barriers to using mental health support services, such as feeling hesitant to seek help and worrying about being seen by others when entering such facilities.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15 16</sup></xref> Even among student athletes with sufficient knowledge about mental health, factors such as reluctance to seek psychiatric help and concerns about how others may perceive them can reduce their perceived behavioural control. This may contribute to a gap between their intention to seek help and their behaviour. Next, from the perspective of the Theory of Decisional Balance (a subjective estimate of the benefits and burdens associated with practising a behaviour)<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28 48</sup></xref> in the Transtheoretical Model, several key mechanisms can be considered. Athletes experience a stronger sense of shame (stigma) about seeking support than the general population<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> and often do not seek support owing to busy schedules.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Moreover, they worry that seeking support will affect their performance and training,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> revealing that their &#8216;weaknesses&#8217; may affect playtime. This sense of burden often outweighs the benefits of mental health support resources. Thus, the results may indicate that about half of the college athletes were not favourable towards seeking support. However, this can be considered from another perspective. In our study, we focused on &#8216;psychiatric treatment&#8217; in terms of intentions to seek support. Consequently, the current results may reveal data specific to psychiatric treatment. The sources of support are not limited to hospitals (eg, psychiatric treatment) but also include other options, such as consulting psychological professionals, family, friends or significant others (eg, partners). If college athletes can accurately assess their mental state, they may choose the most suitable option, whether it be psychiatric treatment, consulting a psychological professional, seeking support from family or friends or talking to a significant other. In some cases, avoiding psychiatric treatment may be more appropriate. Moreover, psychiatric treatment may involve factors that carry a stronger stigma than other options (such as a prescription for medication). Considering that athletes experience a stronger feeling of shame (stigma) about seeking support than the general population,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> they may prioritise alternative options over seeking psychiatric care. Therefore, approximately, half (about 50%) of the college athletes may have been reluctant to seek psychiatric treatment, despite their knowledge about mental illness.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Research and policy implications</title><p>Finally, we identified trends in strategies for each group by classifying them into four types based on their mental illness knowledge and their intention to seek psychiatric treatment. This classification addresses the issues noted above and highlights the potential for developing future qualitative research focused on each group.</p><p>Individuals categorised as having &#8216;sufficient knowledge/active behaviour&#8217; are aware of mental illness and have the proactive intention to seek psychiatric treatment. This could lead to the early detection and prevention of mental health problems. Additionally, mental health literacy protects athletes from mental health issues.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> Therefore, in this group, it is necessary to maintain both knowledge of mental illness and a proactive behavioural intention to seek help. To develop appropriate future interventions for this group, qualitative research is needed to clarify the methods and environments that support the maintenance of mental health knowledge. Additionally, by exploring the reasons why individuals in this group think, &#8216;If I feel mental distress, I will visit a psychiatric facility&#8217;, it may be possible to identify the thoughts and means that sustain such intentions. This could inform interventions aimed at maintaining help-seeking intentions. Further, conducting interview-based investigations to identify how knowledge was acquired and what factors led individuals to recognise the need for support may contribute to improving knowledge and promoting proactive behaviour in other groups.</p><p>Among those with &#8216;insufficient knowledge/active behaviour&#8217;, psychiatric treatment is actively sought, which may benefit the early detection and intervention of mental health problems. However, this group lacks adequate knowledge about mental illness, making it essential to provide them with optimal methods for seeking support, including where and from whom to seek assistance. To develop effective future interventions for this group, it is necessary to clarify the background that led to their thoughts and behaviour in seeking support and to examine the accuracy of their understanding regarding how to access psychiatric services and support facilities. This may contribute to strategies aimed at reducing misconceptions about seeking support for mental health. Further, by clarifying the reasons why individuals were motivated to seek psychiatric support despite lacking knowledge, it may be possible to identify novel factors that promote the intention to seek help.</p><p>Those categorised as having &#8216;sufficient knowledge/passive behaviour&#8217; had mental illness knowledge but were reluctant to seek psychiatric treatment support. Athletes have a negative impression of seeking support for mental health issues<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15 16 51</sup></xref> and, consequently, do not intend to seek it. Therefore, it is essential to develop educational content targeted at this group aimed at destigmatising mental health support. For example, research on health literacy has shown that incorporating gamification into educational interventions can enhance health literacy.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> Further, game-based school education programmes for depression may reduce the stigma associated with the condition.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref> The construction of educational content that incorporates these game elements and innovations may be beneficial for college athletes. Moreover, to develop appropriate interventions for this group, it is essential to investigate the reasons and underlying factors that contribute to the reluctance to seek psychiatric support, even among individuals with sufficient knowledge. These factors should be examined from both structural and psychological perspectives, as well as from individual and environmental viewpoints.</p><p>Those with &#8216;insufficient knowledge/passive behaviour&#8217; lack knowledge about mental illness and are reluctant to seek support proactively. To foster early detection and proactive behaviour in seeking support, it is necessary to empower individuals. To develop appropriate interventions for this group, it is necessary to understand their individual characteristics (eg, sex, educational background and positionality). Further, it is necessary to qualitatively examine the psychological and social backgrounds underlying how individuals perceive and assign meaning to acquiring mental health knowledge and seeking support, as well as why they may be reluctant to actively engage in obtaining such knowledge.</p><p>Consequently, conducting qualitative research with each of the categorised groups, beyond the specific framework employed in this study, may help identify useful information for developing interventions that are appropriate to the characteristics of each group.</p><p>Finally, the categorisation of MIDUS factors revealed the following phenomena and approaches. The distribution of &#8216;treatability of illness&#8217; and &#8216;social recognition of illness&#8217; was similar to the total MIDUS score. Contrastingly, for the &#8216;efficacy of medication&#8217; factor, only approximately 50% of college athletes possessed this knowledge. These results suggest that, among the various types of mental illness knowledge, fewer college athletes recognise the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for mental disorders compared with other factors. Further, the correlation analysis indicated that the association between &#8216;efficacy of medication&#8217; and &#8216;intention to seek psychiatric treatment&#8217; was stronger than that of other factors. Considering the categorisation results, understanding the effectiveness of medication treatment may contribute to an increased intention to seek psychiatric care.</p><p>Each group requires targeted support interventions. Therefore, it will be necessary to gather qualitative insights from each group regarding factors that promote or inhibit behavioural actions towards seeking support, such as the sources and timing of their mental health education, and to develop appropriate interventions. Nevertheless, some caution is necessary when interpreting the current results and considering future developments. The categorisation used in this study is not designed to screen individuals with mental health issues to identify those who genuinely require psychiatric treatment. Moreover, misunderstandings related to mental health issues may lead to overmedicalisation in psychiatric treatment. The overmedicalisation of mental health issues can lead to serious problems, such as the overburdening of medical institutions and rising healthcare costs. Therefore, future research should consider these factors and examine the intention to seek psychiatric treatment, the implementation of self-care, the receipt of professional help (eg, psychologist and social worker) and the intention to seek support from others (eg, family, friends and partners). These approaches are necessary to prevent overmedicalisation. Through advancements in research in this field, a personalised mental health programme for college athletes can be developed in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Limitations and future research</title><p>Our study had some limitations. First, it did not consider using facilities related to psychiatric and mental health. Facilities related to psychiatric and mental health may influence help-seeking behaviours.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Therefore, future studies should incorporate the assessments of participants&#8217; experiences and frequencies of using psychiatric and mental health facilities.</p><p>Second, the scale measuring mental illness knowledge was not in a test format; it was based on a self-report measure. Therefore, this limits our ability to assess mental illness knowledge objectively. In addition, the scale lacks theoretical and clinical cut-off scores. Thus, the classification method employed in this study may be useful for exploratory analysis. However, it is important to acknowledge its limitations concerning classification validity and the generalisability of interpretation.</p><p>Third, the word &#8216;psychiatry&#8217; was used in a questionnaire to investigate the intention to seek psychiatric treatment. In Japan, the terms &#8216;psychiatry&#8217; and &#8216;mental disorder&#8217; carry negative connotations related to the terminology itself.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54 55</sup></xref> For example, since psychiatric diagnoses in Japan are expressed using kanji characters, misunderstandings and stigma may be exacerbated owing to people inferring meaning directly from these characters.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56</sup></xref> Additionally, media portrayals and crime reports may create negative associations between mental illness and criminal behaviour, contributing to feelings of fear and anxiety. Moreover, social stereotypes persist, characterising individuals with mental illnesses as &#8216;mentally weak&#8217; or &#8216;lacking mental strength&#8217;. Consequently, various alternative terms have recently been adopted, including &#8216;Department of Psychiatry (in Japanese, Seishin-ka)&#8217;, &#8216;Department of Psychiatry and Neurology (in Japanese, Seishin-Shinkei-ka)&#8217;, &#8216;Mental Clinic (in Japanese, Mentaru-Kurinikku)&#8217; and &#8216;psychosomatic medicine (in Japanese, Shinryo-Nai-ka),&#8217; since the term &#8216;psychiatry&#8217; is considered more stigmatising than other words (eg, mental health clinic).<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54 55</sup></xref> However, in this study, the term &#8216;psychiatric treatment&#8217; was specifically used, which may have led to culturally specific connotations associated with the Japanese language influencing participants&#8217; responses regarding their intention to seek psychiatric treatment.</p><p>Fourth, this study has a restricted scope of participants. Participants in this study were Japanese, and the number of universities surveyed was limited. Future research should expand the range of participants and consider ethnic and cultural differences.</p><p>Finally, the internal consistency of the &#8216;efficacy of medication&#8217; factor of MIDUS is insufficient. The internal consistency of the intention to seek psychiatric treatment has not been confirmed. Both the MIDUS and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment were based on self-report assessments. Self-report assessments may reflect social desirability. Therefore, future research should develop and use a scale that ensures internal consistency and objectively evaluates student athletes&#8217; understanding of mental problems, illnesses, disorders and help-seeking behaviour.</p><p>This study examined the knowledge of mental illness and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment among college athletes. However, this study focused on seeking psychiatric support. Since support seeking is not limited to psychiatry, future research should conduct a broader investigation. Further, it is necessary to qualitatively understand the characteristics of each group and measure the variables related to mental state to explore intervention methods. Clarifying these aspects will help identify key points for individually optimised interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study categorised college athletes based on their mental illness knowledge and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment, and it clarified the forms of the latter. We concluded that college athletes possessed a certain level of knowledge about mental illness. However, over 60% of college athletes were reluctant to seek psychiatric treatment. Further, mental illness knowledge and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment were weakly correlated, suggesting that mental illness knowledge did not necessarily lead to the intention to seek psychiatric treatment. Finally, in the sufficient knowledge/passive behaviour group, approximately 50% of college athletes were aware of mental illness but were uninclined to seek support.</p><p>Several mental health issues arise during childhood or adolescence, making early intervention a crucial factor, especially for college athletes. Further studies should clarify the discrepancy observed between knowledge of mental illness and the intention to seek psychiatric treatment among this population. This can help develop individualised optimisation approaches tailored to the characteristics of college athletes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-091919</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s001.docx" id="d67e1905" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are especially grateful to the college athletes who took part in this study.
