Research indicates that CAFs in various tumors exhibit robust lactate metabolism, ultimately becoming the primary source of lactate in the tumor microenvironment. Emerging evidence has established that CAFs could orchestrate gastric cancer (GC) immune evasion. However, the potential role of CAFs-derived lactate in immunotherapy remains elusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In our research, CUT&amp;Tag and transcriptome sequencing were employed to detect the target gene of histone lactylation. Co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry analysis, and molecular docking, were utilized to explore the interactions between proteins. We performed cellular, animal, and organoid experiments to verify the mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">We found that lactate secreted by CAFs was elevated, facilitating the lactylation of H3K18 in GC cells. As a target of H3K18la, ASPM played crucial roles in regulating the GC progression by promoting resistance to anti-PD-1. Mechanistically, ASPM promoted the transport of NCAPG from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by directly binding to it and then enhanced the deubiquitination of NCAPG mediated by BUB3, thereby increasing the expression of NCAPG. Furthermore, NCAPG targeted the SRC/STAT3 pathway and elevated PD-L1 expression. In addition, Daturilin has been preliminarily identified as a small-molecule inhibitor targeting NCAPG.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">In conclusion, we have identified that CAFs-derived lactate promoted GC progression and clarified its mechanism, proposing the H3K18la-ASPM-NCAPG axis. Daturilin could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment. This offers innovative perspectives on the complex role of CAFs in the TME and the influence of lactate on tumor progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12967-025-07013-0.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Gastric cancer</kwd><kwd>Lactate</kwd><kwd>Cancer-associated fibroblasts</kwd><kwd>Ubiquitination</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Medical and Health Science and Technology Project of Zhejiang Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>2024KY1535; 2025KY240</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par27">According to the latest GLOBOCAN report, gastric cancer (GC) stands as the fifth most common cancer globally and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Notwithstanding the decrease in the incidence and mortality rates of GC worldwide attributed to the progress in medical technology, enhanced health concepts, and improved hygiene conditions, GC still constitutes one of the principal threats to human health in the East Asian region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. At present, radical gastrectomy-based comprehensive treatment, combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, has been the primary strategy for humans to confront GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, the majority of patients are diagnosed at the middle or advanced stages.</p><p id="Par28">The development of IHC and next-generation sequencing for tumor mutational burden quantification has enabled precision immunotherapy stratification. The integration of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy with platinum-based chemotherapy has been established as the first-line standard of care for gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, pivotal findings from the KEYNOTE-059 clinical trial revealed divergent objective response rates (ORR) of 11.2% (anti-PD-1 monotherapy) versus 60.0% (anti-PD-1/chemotherapy combination) in patients with advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This striking contrast underscores the critical clinical realities: while chemotherapy synergistically potentiates PD-1 blockade efficacy, a substantial patient subset exhibits persistent therapeutic resistance. Anti-PD-1 resistance is closely associated with energy metabolism, the tumor microenvironment (TME), and classical oncogenic pathways such as the P53 pathway. Nevertheless, mechanistic dissection of anti-PD-1 resistance pathways and the development of molecularly targeted countermeasures now constitute urgent priorities in precision immuno-oncology.</p><p id="Par29">The TME plays a crucial role in sustaining proliferation signals, resisting cellular apoptosis, promoting angiogenesis, activating invasion and metastasis, facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, triggering pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, and enabling immune evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In GC, it has been observed that the TME can facilitate tumor progression by suppressing the immune response, which is to a large extent attributed to the inhibition of T cell activation by the stromal components of the TME and the crosstalk with GC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. GC patients developing acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade therapy are predominantly classified into the fibrotic-enriched (F-type) subgroup within contemporary immune/stromal stratification systems. Histopathological quantification reveals marked enrichment of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the TME of these F-type tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. CAFs constitute approximately 70% of the cells in tumor tissues and are the major components of the TME, where they execute multiple pro-cancerous functions in the tumor tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. CAFs interact with tumor cells and other components of the TME through remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM), exosomes, cytokines, etc., creating a supportive niche for cancer stem cells, diminishing the tumor immune microenvironment, and reprogramming cancer cell metabolism, contributing to the promotion of tumor metastasis and immune evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Additionally, metabolomics has also disclosed that the lipids generated by CAF metabolism can stimulate peritoneal metastasis of colon cancer, which further provides a basis for investigating the regulatory effects of CAF metabolites on tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">As a byproduct of the Warburg effect, lactate often exerts significant functions in the TME. It can acidify the local milieu and act as a signaling molecule to activate related receptors on cancer cells, facilitating angiogenesis, immune escape, and chemotherapy resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Additionally, the augmented lactate in the TME intensifies the metabolic reprogramming of both tumor cells and immune cells, shaping a TME conducive to invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. CAFs are regarded as one of the principal suppliers of lactic acid in the TME. A study published recently has unveiled a novel lactate-mediated immunosuppressive axis in GC. The research demonstrates that lactate metabolites in GC cells selectively promote nuclear translocation of the transcriptional regulator NTAT1 in tumor-infiltrating CD8&#8201;+&#8201;T lymphocytes. This metabolic reprogramming event suppresses PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Nevertheless, no studies have reported on the effects exerted by lactic acid derived from CAFs on tumor cells as of now [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">In our research, we verified the role of CAFs in tumor progression in GC and probed into the influence of lactate produced by CAFs on the TME. Subsequently, we identified the crucial target protein assembly factor for spindle microtubules (ASPM) in GC cells through transcriptomics sequencing and CUT&amp;Tag and discovered that it could facilitate GC progression and diminish the efficacy of anti-PD-1. Then, we carried out a proteomics analysis to delineate the molecular mechanism of ASPM&#8217;s function in GC and proposed the H3K18la-ASPM-NCAPG regulatory axis for the first time. Additionally, we found that BUB3 promotes the deubiquitination of NCAPG by binding to it. The above discoveries have unveiled a novel mechanism by which lactate derived from CAFs regulates tumor cells, enabling us to delve deeper into the resistance mechanisms associated with anti-PD-1. Furthermore, this research suggests that NCAPG may serve as a potential molecular target for developing novel molecule inhibitors aimed at improving immunotherapy efficacy in GC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tissue samples</title><p id="Par32">This retrospective study enrolled patients meeting all the following criteria: aged 18&#8211;80&#160;years, diagnosed with GC at our institution between January 2018 and December 2023, absence of other malignancies, and no prior blood transfusions.

The cDNA synthesis was then performed with the Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific, K1641, USA), and adapter ligation was completed using the VAHTS DNA Adapters Set 8 for MGI (Vazyme, NM108-01/02, China). After performing quality control with a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Personalbio, Shanghai, China), we temporarily stored the total RNA at -80&#160;&#176;C and conducted high-throughput mRNA sequencing on the BGIseq 500 platform using a paired-end configuration with a read length of 100&#160;bp per end. For the post-sequencing bioinformatics analysis, the core RNA-seq analysis pipeline consisted of trimming, quality filtering, gene quantification, and different expression analysis of the transcriptome sequencing data. The trimming process aimed to remove adapter sequences, low-quality bases, and reads containing excessive N bases. Adapter removal required at least 3&#160;bp of adapter sequence matched at read ends, with a quality threshold&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;Q20 and an error rate&#8201;&lt;&#8201;1%; reads containing&#8201;&gt;&#8201;3 N bases were discarded. Quality assessment reports generated by FastQC were used for initial evaluation. Low-quality reads (where&#8201;&gt;&#8201;40% of bases had Q&#8201;&lt;&#8201;20) were removed, and the filtered data needed to achieve an error rate&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.1%. FeatureCounts was used for gene quantification, and differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis</title><p id="Par41">All plasmids used in this study were provided by Miaoling Biotechnology (China).

Firstly, the analysis of pan-lactylation and site-specific histone lactylation patterns was conducted in GC tissues from anti-PD-1 therapy responders versus non-responders. IHC analysis demonstrated markedly elevated pan-lactylation (Pan Kla) levels and histone H3K18 lactylation (H3K18la) modification density in non-responder tumors compared to responder counterparts, suggesting lactate-mediated chromatin remodeling as a potential resistance mechanism to immune checkpoint blockade (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Then we examined the expression levels of histone pan-lactylation and H3K18la in gastric cancer tissues and the corresponding normal tissues. Western blot demonstrated that Pan Kla and H3K18la were significantly upregulated in GC tissues (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Validation at the cellular level also indicated that the lactate contents and the expression levels of Pan Kla and H3K18la in several common GC cell lines were significantly elevated compared to those in the normal gastric glandular epithelial cell line GES-1 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C&#8211;D). To clarify the association of CAFs with lactate levels in GC cells, we measured lactate concentrations in the supernatants of CAFs and NFs culture media, as well as in various gastric cancer cell lines after culturing them in different conditioned media.

Co-IP assays demonstrated that exogenous and endogenous ASPM were capable of interacting with NCAPG in HEK-293&#160;T cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E). Interestingly, western blot reveals that ASPM promotes the expression of NCAPG in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F). Research has demonstrated that NCAPG mediates trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer by upregulating the SRC/STAT3 pathway, a critical upstream regulator of PD-L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

Furthermore, the immunofluorescence assay was employed to investigate whether ASPM promotes PD-L1 expression via the NCAPG-dependent SRC/STAT3 pathway. Results showed that CAFs-CM markedly activated the SRC/STAT3/PD-L1 signaling axis. This activation was suppressed by NCAPG knockdown but restored through ASPM overexpression, which effectively reversed the inhibitory effects of sh NCAPG (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6I</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>J).<fig id="Fig6" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;6</label><caption><p>ASPM interacts with NCAPG to promote NCAPG expression and upregulates the SRC/STAT3/PD-L1 axis. <bold>A</bold> Prediction of potential ASPM-interacting proteins using the Mania database. <bold>B</bold> Silver staining assay following co-IP to detect specific protein bands associated with ASPM. <bold>C</bold> Secondary mass spectrometry spectrum of NCAPG identified through proteomic analysis. <bold>D</bold> Molecular correlation analysis between NCAPG and ASPM based on TCGA-STAD database. <bold>E</bold> Exogenous interaction validation between ASPM and NCAPG via co-IP and Western blot in HEK-293&#160;T cells transfected with tagged plasmids. <bold>F</bold> Western blot analysis of NCAPG expression in HEK-293&#160;T cells co-transfected with 1&#160;&#956;g NCAPG plasmid and escalating doses of ASPM plasmid (0.125&#160;&#956;g, 0.25&#160;&#956;g, 0.5&#160;&#956;g, 0.75&#160;&#956;g, and 1&#160;&#956;g). <bold>G</bold> qRT-PCR validation of PD-L1 expression modulation by NCAPG knockdown or overexpression. <bold>H</bold> Western blot confirmation of PD-L1 expression changes induced by NCAPG modulation. <bold>I</bold> If analysis of SRC/STAT3/PD-L1 axis activation under NCAPG-modulated conditions</p></caption><graphic id="d33e915" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="12967_2025_7013_Fig6_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par60">To delineate specific interaction domains between ASPM and NCAPG, molecular docking simulations were performed.

Then we performed co-IP assays separately in cells under various culture conditions. The results indicated that tumor cells cultured with CAFs-CM exhibited lower ubiquitination levels of NCAPG (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>M). In contrast, tumor cells cultured in NFs-CM displayed elevated levels of NCAPG ubiquitination. Notably, the addition of sintilimab alone was also capable of increasing the ubiquitination level of NCAPG (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>N). Furthermore, we investigated the effects of lactate and ASPM on the ubiquitination level of NCAPG and verified that lactate could inhibit the ubiquitination of NCAPG via ASPM (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>O). Two major forms of polyubiquitin chains constituted by Lys48 (K48) or Lys63 (K63) linkages have been depicted. We employed a group of ubiquitin mutants, which retain only one Lys residue and have the remaining residues substituted by Arg residues, to investigate which type of polyubiquitin modification on NCAPG is influenced by BUB3. We observed that the expression of BUB3 suppressed the K48-linked but not the K63-linked ubiquitination of NCAPG (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>P). Additionally, the expression of NCAPG was attenuated by the enforced expression of Lys48-resistant (K48R) ubiquitin (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>Q). To determine the specific ubiquitination sites, we predicted three lysine sites of NCAPG based on GPS-Uber (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>R). We constructed three lysine-to-arginine substitution mutants of NCAPG. In the absence of BUB3 overexpression, all three mutants exhibited relatively high levels of ubiquitination; however, these levels were not as pronounced as those observed in wild-type NCAPG. By comparing the ubiquitination levels across different mutants, we determined that BUB3 specifically targeted the K11R mutant for deubiquitination (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>S). Moreover, downregulation of His-NCAPG due to BUB3 depletion was mitigated by the K11R mutation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>T).</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Discovery of a small-molecule inhibitor targeting the NCAPG active site</title><p id="Par63">Emerging evidence suggests that combinatorial chemotherapy significantly enhances anti-PD-1 efficacy, prompting further exploration of synergistic agents to optimize immunotherapy outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].
