Dynamic birth positions, which enable women to adopt various positions during labor and delivery, are associated with improved obstetric outcomes. However, the extent of knowledge and practice regarding dynamic birth positions among Ethiopian midwives remains poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p id="Par2">To assess midwives&#8217; awareness and practice of dynamic birth positions and explore their perspectives and experiences.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par3">A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was employed to evaluate midwives&#8217; knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding dynamic birth positions. Quantitative data were analyzed using stepwise backward elimination logistic regression to identify key predictors, while qualitative data were examined through thematic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">The study included 483 midwives, with 473 participating in the quantitative survey and 10 in the qualitative interviews. Fewer than half of the midwives demonstrated good levels of knowledge (45%) and attitude (49.5%), while only 22.6% reported regular practice of dynamic birth positions. Participation in training emerged as the strongest predictor of knowledge, attitude, and practice. Thematic analysis revealed six key themes: routine practices, awareness, clinical implementation, barriers, facilitators, and user needs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par5">Awareness and practice of dynamic birth positions among Ethiopian midwives are notably low. Key barriers include limited awareness and suboptimal working conditions, whereas targeted training significantly enhances all assessed domains. To promote the adoption of dynamic birth positions, efforts should focus on increasing awareness, modifying delivery equipment, and improving the clinical environment.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12884-025-08051-8.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dynamic birth position</kwd><kwd>Knowledge</kwd><kwd>Practice</kwd><kwd>Barriers</kwd><kwd>Midwives</kwd><kwd>Mixed method study</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">In Ethiopia, only about 48% of births occur in health facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Several barriers contribute to this low utilization, including a lack of respectful maternity care particularly the inability to choose birthing positions poor quality of care, limited involvement in care planning, restricted mobility during labor, and shortages of skilled healthcare providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Promoting maternal mobility and allowing women to adopt birthing positions of their choice such as standing, squatting, sitting, side-lying, kneeling, or being on all fours is associated with improved obstetric outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Dynamic birth position refers to an individualized, fluid progression through different laboring and birthing postures, guided by the woman&#8217;s instinctive responses to her body&#8217;s needs for comfort and ease. It integrates periods of movement and rest and supports a natural, self-directed birthing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This approach encompasses any non-supine position that facilitates pelvic mobility, including standing, kneeling, squatting, lateral positions, use of a birth seat, or the all-fours position each chosen freely by the woman throughout labor and delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Using dynamic birth positions has been proven to have many benefits. Women who assume a non-supine position for birth have fewer perineal tears, less vulvar oedema, less blood loss, shorter second stages, fewer abnormal fetal heart rates, lower caesarean section rates, and a higher rate of spontaneous vaginal birth (SVB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This is due to the upright birthing position significantly expanding women&#8217;s pelvic dimensions and facilitating the descent of the baby&#8217;s head [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, upright and other flexible sacrum positions significantly reduce women&#8217;s pain and increase their satisfaction, positively impacting the birth experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Despite the evidence, in Ethiopia and most other low-income countries, almost all women giving birth in health facilities are in a supine or lithotomy position during the second stage of labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Giving women the option to assume different birth positions and respecting their choice is part of respectful maternity care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Several studies have been conducted to assess the advantages and disadvantages of different birthing positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Women&#8217;s health conditions during pregnancy, the relationship with care providers, fetal heart rate monitoring, the use of continuous cardiotocography, amniotomy, the use of episiotomy, the use of operative vaginal delivery, epidural anaesthesia, and disagreement with co-workers are barriers to the utilisation of dynamic birth positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. There is shortage of evidences from Sub-Saharan Africa and only two studies from Ethiopia and Uganda reported similar findings on the benefit of dynamic birth position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Factors including knowledge of health professionals, job satisfaction, years of experience, and institutional policies are reported to be facilitators for the use of different birth positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Knowledge and attitude are key determinants of professional behavior and practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the context of maternity care, midwives with sound knowledge and positive attitudes toward evidence-based practices are more likely to implement those practices in clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Despite growing global advocacy for respectful maternity care including the use of dynamic birth positions there remains a lack of evidence on how well midwives understand, value, and apply these practices in their day-to-day work.</p><p id="Par11">In Ethiopia, where health system challenges already limit women&#8217;s autonomy during childbirth, little is known about midwives&#8217; awareness, attitudes, and actual use of dynamic birth positions. Understanding these factors is essential for designing effective interventions to promote women-centered care and improve birth outcomes.</p><p id="Par12">Therefore, this study aimed to assess midwives&#8217; knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to dynamic birth positions and to explore their experiences and perspectives to inform future training and policy strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par13">An institution-based mixed-method study (a concurrent cross-sectional and qualitative descriptive) was conducted in North Shoa, Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia, from October to November 2024. North Shoa zone comprises 24 Woredas and 3 city administrations. There are around 11 hospitals and 91 health centres in the study area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study participants</title><p id="Par14">All midwives working in public health facilities in the study area were included if they had more than one year of work experience. A total of 473 midwives participated in the quantitative survey, and 10 midwives participated in the in-depth interviews for the qualitative part of the study. The department heads were approached to identify qualitative interviewees who have diverse experience and exposure in their profession and delivery-related routine activities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par15">Quantitative data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire. There was no existing suitable assessment tool. Therefore, a tool for the assessment of knowledge and attitude was developed using the three-step modified Delphi method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Knowledge about dynamic birth positions was assessed using a 12-item tool with a Cronbach&#8217;s alpha of 0.89, and the attitude was assessed using a 10-item question with a Cronbach&#8217;s alpha of 0.77. The knowledge section had three response alternatives (yes, no, and I do not know) scored as 3, 2, and 1 point respectively. The correct response for all items except for items 3 and 5 was &#8220;Yes&#8221;; however, for items 3 and 5, the correct response was &#8220;No&#8221; and thus those were reversed during analysis. One point was scored for items answered correctly and zero for items with wrong answers for the final scaling of the correct response. The total scores were summed and scored against the 12 total scores. Individuals who scored 50% and above out of the 12 expected points were considered to have good knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">The attitude section was scaled using a five-level Likert scale with 1 being strongly disagree and 5 being strongly agree. The scores for negatively scored items (3, 4, 9, and 10) were reversed during the analysis stage to ensure uniform scoring. The total score was summed and categorised based on the mean score. Individuals were considered to have a favourable attitude if they scored more than the mean score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Eight positions, six non-supine (standing, squatting, side-lying, sitting on the birth seat, standing on all fours, and kneeling), and two supine positions (lying on the back or lithotomy, and semi-sitting), were included to assess the level of practice. Midwives were asked to mark a position if they had ever practised it. Midwives who practised three or more non-supine birth positions were considered to have a good practice level, while midwives who used two or fewer non-supine positions were considered to have a poor practice level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">A pilot test was conducted on 5% of the study participants in a different area. Six BSc midwives were trained for one day on data collection using the tool, and two MSc midwives were assigned to supervise the data collection. Supervisors checked the completeness of the data on a daily basis and addressed issues in a timely manner. An open-ended interview guide was developed in English and translated into Amharic for the qualitative data collection. The interview was conducted for an average duration of 30&#160;min with each interviewee. The principal investigator conducted all the interviews. All interviews were audio recorded and field notes were taken with the help of an assistant. Sustained researcher engagement, iterative questioning, and maximum variation sampling techniques were used to maintain trustworthiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par19">The survey data were entered into Epidata version 4.6 and exported to STATA 17 for statistical analysis. Summary statistics (Proportion, Mean, SD, and Ranges) were used to report the descriptive summary of the data. A stepwise backward elimination logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with the knowledge, attitude, and practice of midwives on GBP, and statistical significance was declared at a p-value of less than 0.05. Regarding the qualitative data, the interviews were transcribed verbatim and translated into English. The six-step thematic analysis was used for data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Accordingly, codes were developed inductively by the main researcher and shared with the co-authors. Confirmatory feedback was received from all authors on the developed codes, and slight modifications were made based on comments from one researcher after a thorough discussion. Then, the codes were categorised into themes, which were named and defined. Quotes were extracted and presented along with the summary of the themes to support the evidence.</p><p id="Par20">The principal investigator (OY) was a midwife tutor and PhD student with more than 17 years of academic, research, and leadership experience. He is also familiar with the subject of DBP from the capacity building training and involved in the provision of training on DBP. However, he has minimal engagement in clinical practice setting. Other member of research team have PhD degree. Two of the members (HL &amp; KE) were experienced in qualitative study and in the subject of DBP; and they are the one who introduced it in the form of capacity building training for midwives in the study area. The principal investigator had the capacity building training on DBP, and participated in different activities in the subject matter. I, the principal investigator, have a relativist ontological view which consider reality of DBP as relative to each midwife apart aspects that can be measured objectively. Therefore, the principal investigator took a constructivist research paradigm by which the reality needs to be interpreted. The development of code and interpretation would be affected by my experience. However, every coding and interpretation was presented for the research team and adequate feedback was taken to avoid bias.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Quantitative findings</title><p id="Par21">This study recruited a total of 473 participants: 252 (53.3%) female and 221 (46.7%) male midwives.

The level of knowledge measured is further elaborated by the conceptualization of DBP by midwives. Attitude estimated quantitatively but also its role in making the practice was explored qualitatively.</p><p id="Par88">&#8206;The knowledge, attitude and practice were very much affected by capacity building training. The qualitative data explained how midwives come to know about DBP from the training, the MIDWIZE project specifically. Low practice level was explained by the factors stated under barriers while having capacity building training was seen as a positive predictor from the quantitative data. Potential solutions were explored under facilitators and users requirement. Generally the use of the mixed method help to see the different aspects of dynamic birth position, and enable us make a more complete view of the subject.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par89">This concurrent mixed-methods study assessed midwives&#8217; knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to dynamic birth positions (DBPs), along with associated factors. The findings revealed that fewer than half of the participants demonstrated good knowledge, held favorable attitudes, or regularly practiced DBPs. The study identified the source of knowledge as a significant factor associated with knowledge levels. Additionally, both facility type and source of knowledge were significantly linked to attitudes toward DBPs, while gender, source of knowledge, and level of knowledge were significantly associated with the practice of DBPs.</p><p id="Par90">About 45% of the midwives have good knowledge of dynamic birth positions. Side-lying, squatting, and kneeling are the most frequently identified dynamic birth positions. This is almost similar to a study in Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, it is lower compared to a study in Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This may be due to the differences in the working environment and resources between developed and Sub-Saharan African countries.</p><p id="Par91">Midwives describe dynamic birth positions as positions based on maternal choice and comfort; it is also described as not being in one position and giving birth in non-supine positions. This understanding aligns with the WHO labour care user&#8217;s guide and the hybrid concept analysis on the understanding of dynamic birth positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par92">Reducing labour duration, providing pain relief, and decreasing episiotomies and tears are among the benefits reported by midwives. This view matches the findings of several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on different birthing positions in Turkey, Egypt, and Spain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This may be due to the fact that non-supine positions open up the pelvis and facilitate labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par93">Midwives who reported having learned about dynamic birth positions from training are more likely to have good knowledge. This might be due to the effect of in-service training in improving professionals&#8217; knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Midwives who have learned from school and co-workers also demonstrate good knowledge. This might be due to the positive influence of peers on staff members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par94">A positive attitude is reported as a reason for good practice, and about 49.5% of midwives have a good attitude towards dynamic birth positions. About 54.1% of midwives strongly agree that midwives need training, and more than 60% of midwives agree that dynamic birth positions enhance spontaneous vaginal delivery. This aligns with findings established by several RCT studies in Turkey, Egypt, and Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par95">Lying on the back or in the lithotomy position is the most frequently used position. The practice of dynamic birth positions is very limited, with only 22.65% of midwives reporting having ever used three or more non-supine positions during delivery. Side-lying was the most used dynamic birth position apart from lithotomy. This is similar to studies in Nigeria and Kenya but lower than a study in Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This may be due to differences in the quality of care between developed and developing Sub-Saharan African countries. Midwives also reported in the in-depth interviews that side-lying is what they frequently use when they assist in labour outside of the couch. This may be due to the ease of using the side-lying position on the bed.</p><p id="Par96">The use of the supine position on the delivery couch was reported to interfere with the frequency and intensity of uterine contractions, prolonging the duration of labour. This may be due to a reduction in blood flow to the uterus, which also reduces the amount of oxytocin that has to reach the organ and diminishes the Ferguson reflex or utero-pituitary reflex, which becomes very active when there is pressure on the cervix while women assume a non-supine position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Taking the dynamic solution to keep women on the bed until the baby&#8217;s head crowns and becomes visible might serve a purpose in such situations.</p><p id="Par97">Non-supportive work environment, staff shortages, lack of decision-making power, the need to be in awkward positions to assist, poor attitudes, lack of knowledge, and lack of skill were among the reasons mentioned as barriers to the practice of dynamic birth positions. A study from South Africa reported similar barriers, including lack of knowledge, skill, and non-supportive setup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A similar study from Australia reported that midwives&#8217; practices are significantly affected by the condition of the delivery room [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This may be due to the similar requirements for providing care globally. Hence, modifying the delivery couch and the setup, providing training, increasing staff numbers, and legal enforcement with guidelines and policies are reported as necessary to enhance the practice of dynamic birth positions.</p><p id="Par98">One of the key strengths of this study is the development of a new survey tool to assess midwives&#8217; knowledge and attitudes toward dynamic birth positions, guided by the modified Delphi method. The study&#8217;s trustworthiness was further enhanced through prolonged researcher engagement as the principal researcher work all the way from interview guide development, conducting the interview, transcribing, translating to coding and writing the final report; iterative questioning was used by adjusting the questions based on the responses obtained, and maximum variation sampling was used by recruiting midwives from maintaining the gender balance, work experience and types of health facility, which strengthened the credibility and depth of the qualitative findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The use of a mixed-methods design allowed for a comprehensive exploration of both measurable trends and nuanced insights. Additionally, conducting a census of all midwives in the study area improved the representativeness of the sample and increased the statistical power of the findings.</p><p id="Par99">However, the study did not include the perspectives of other key stakeholders such as physicians, nurses, or facility administrators, which may have limited the understanding of broader institutional or interdisciplinary factors affecting the use of dynamic birth positions. Midwives in this study were from health facilities in 24 districts and two city administration; and the representativeness may be limited. Therefore, the generalizability and the interpretation needs to take this fact in consideration. Additionally, the birth positions investigated in this study were only those which can be used in the study setting, and we would like to inform our reader the list might be different for a resourceful work environment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par100">The Knowledge and practice of dynamic birth positions among midwives were very low. Training was found to be the common predictor for midwives&#8217; knowledge, attitudes, and practices. The knowledge level was a key determinant of practice.</p><p id="Par101">Pain relief, shortened labor duration, reduced episiotomy and perineal trauma, improved maternal and fetal outcomes, and increased maternal satisfaction were reported to be benefits of dynamic birth positions. However, lack of supportive infrastructure, staffing shortages, limited decision-making autonomy, insufficient knowledge and skills, and unfavorable attitudes among midwives identified as barriers for the practice.</p><p id="Par102">Therefore, it is commendable to expand training opportunities, encourage peer learning, and develop clear guidelines supported by legal and institutional frameworks. In addition, modifying delivery rooms including redesigning birth couches and increasing the workforce could enhance the uptake and consistent practice of dynamic birth positions in health facilities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
