While improvements in protein labeling techniques have enabled the measurement of proteomes with increased sensitivity, measuring cell type-specific proteomes in vivo remains challenging. One of the most useful pipelines is bio-orthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) with the MetRS* system, consisting of a transgenic mouse line expressing a mutant methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS*) controlled by Cre recombinase expression. This system allows cell type-specific labeling of proteins with a noncanonical amino acid (azidonorleucine, ANL), which can be subsequently conjugated to affinity or fluorescent tags using click chemistry. Click-modified proteins can then be visualized, purified and identified. The reduction in sample complexity enables the detection of small changes in protein composition. Here, we describe a multicopy MetRS* mouse line (3xMetRS* mouse line) that exhibits markedly enhanced ANL protein labeling, boosting the sensitivity and temporal resolution of the system and eliminating the need for working under methionine depletion conditions. Cell type-specific in vivo labeling is possible even in heterozygous animals, thus offering an enormous advantage for crossing the line into mutation and disease-specific backgrounds. Using the 3xMetRS* line, we identified the in vivo proteome of a sparse cell population&#8212;the dopaminergic neurons of the olfactory bulb&#8212;and furthermore determined newly synthesized proteins after short labeling durations following a single intraperitoneal ANL injection.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The authors describe the second generation of the mutant methionyl tRNA synthetase mouse line, designed to increase mutant enzyme expression, enhance the labeling of nascent proteins and facilitate cell type-specific proteome identification.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Protein-protein interaction networks</kwd><kwd>Neurotransmitters</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>MICINN/ PID2020-113270RA-I00</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature America, Inc. 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Main</title><p id="Par3">Cellular protein composition and how it is modified in response to physiological and pathological signals and events is key to understanding how cells function. It is clear that the same extra- or intracellular signals can lead to distinct proteomic responses in different cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Indeed, bulk analyses of proteomes can &#8216;average out&#8217; intrinsic cellular differences as well as cell type-specific differences in responses. One way to obtain cell type-specific proteomes exploits cell type-specific markers and fluorescent labeling, followed by enrichment using fluorescence-activated cell sorting for subsequent mass spectrometry (MS) studies. A drawback of this approach, however, is the loss of processes and compartments, such as dendrites or axons, during sample processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. By contrast, BioID- and TurboID-based methods are explicitly designed to identify proteins from targeted subcellular regions. Because protein populations are labeled in a proximity-dependent manner at a specific time point, this method includes spatial and temporal information but does not distinguish between newly synthesized and preexisting proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Bio-orthogonal methods based on the use of artificial amino acid analogs as baits for protein visualization and purification are particularly amenable to the study of cell type-specific proteomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The incorporation of artificial amino acids into proteins can be genetically controlled to enable cell type-specific labeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For instance, the expression of a mutant methionyl-tRNA synthetase with an enlarged methionine recognition pocket (L274G point mutation; hereafter referred to as MetRS*) allows the charging of the methionine analog azidonorleucine (ANL) to the corresponding methionine tRNA. ANL has a slightly larger structure compared with methionine. This size difference is sufficient to exclude ANL recognition by the endogenous MetRS; thus, ANL is not incorporated into proteins in cells where MetRS* is not present<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. When MetRS* expression is driven by cell type-specific promoters, it enables specific labeling of proteomes with ANL and, after tissue lysis or fixation, derivatization of the azide group present in ANL with an alkyne by click chemistry. The alkyne can be used to visualize cell type-specific proteomes by immunofluorescence (FUNCAT) or western blot (BONCAT) and to purify these proteomes. The MetRS* system overcomes the above-mentioned challenges: it is possible to obtain cell type-specific proteomes without losing proteins located in dendrites or axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In addition, the time window of protein synthesis is determined by the exposure time of ANL, and protein degradation or subcellular location of ANL-labeled proteins is not altered; using this method, it is even possible to measure protein half-lives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Based on this system, we originally created a mouse model carrying a knock-in of the MetRS* gene fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) by a P2A peptide under an enhanced actin promoter. Expression of the cassette is switched on by Cre-dependent excision of a transcriptional stop. Crossing this mouse line with cell type-specific Cre drivers enables cell type-specific protein labeling and its subsequent visualization, purification and identification. Given the considerable number of Cre drivers, the described system can be used to study cell type-specific proteins from almost any tissue in any field. Proteins can be labeled with ANL in live animals or in vitro. Using this first generation of mice, we demonstrated that it is possible to purify and identify cell type-specific proteomes allowing the identification of the respective cell type of origin. Furthermore, we identified proteins whose expression in the excitatory hippocampal neurons is modified in response to an enriched environment, a well-established paradigm for synaptic plasticity enhancement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. It is also possible to identify changes in protein expression in models of prion diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, we observed limitations when we aimed to obtain proteomes from relatively low-abundance cell types. Similarly, the identification of proteins labeled for short periods was not possible in brain tissue using this mouse model. Furthermore, given that the line expresses a single copy of the MetRS*, we probably observed substantial competition with methionine incorporation by the endogenous MetRS. Indeed, to obtain good in vivo labeling, a low-methionine diet and homozygous MetRS* alleles were required. The need for homozygosity complicates the crossing of this mouse line into a disease or any other background of interest. To overcome these limitations, we describe here a second generation of the MetRS* mouse tool designed to increase the expression of the mutant enzyme. The new design of the line boosts ANL incorporation into proteins, allowing the isolation and identification of low-number neuronal populations, such as the dopaminergic (DA) neurons, and proteins synthesized in the excitatory neurons of the cortex after just 3&#8201;h of a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ANL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The 3xMetRS* mouse line</title><p id="Par6">To achieve more efficient ANL labeling to purify proteomes from sparse cell populations or from proteomes after short ANL labeling times, we focused on improving the expression of MetRS*. We therefore modified and optimized the allele design of the previous MetRS* mouse line (termed 1xMetRS* here). We maintained the overall strategy of a Cre-dependent excision of a floxed transcriptional stop to switch on transcription of a cassette with MetRS* and GFP in the ROSA26 locus (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Whereas the 1xMetRS* line carried a GFP sequence fused to the MetRS* coding region, separated by the self-cleaving 2A peptide sequence (P2A) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), the new MetRS* mouse line described here (hereafter referred to as 3xMetRS*) expresses a cassette carrying three copies of MetRS* coding sequences and one copy of GFP per allele, with all four parts separated by sequences coding for different self-cleaving 2A peptides (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). As this expression cassette codes for a very large mRNA (and protein before separation of the single units by self-cleavage), we added an mRNA stabilization element (WPRE) to boost expression of the exogenous mRNA. In addition, we shifted the GFP to the C-terminus of the encoded protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). As such, we ensured that, if GFP is detected, MetRS* is also translated. Mice carrying the 3xMetRS* allele and the Cre::3xMetRS* lines used in this work were viable and fertile, and both heterozygous and homozygous mice showed no obvious behavioral differences compared with wild-type mice. We use the MetRS* copy numbers to refer to the genotype: 1xMetRS* and 2xMetRS* when studying heterozygous or homozygous animals, respectively, in the previously described mouse line; and 3xMetRS* or 6xMetRS* when using heterozygous or homozygous animals of the new line (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Comparison of the two mouse lines for ANL cell type-specific protein labeling.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Insertion of the MetRS* cassette in the ROSA26 locus of wild-type mice (WT). <bold>b</bold>, Scheme of the cassette introduced in the first generation of the floxed-STOP-MetRS* mouse line.

First, we evaluated whether there was increased ANL labeling in the 3xMetRS* line compared with the 1xMetRS* line in vitro. We crossed animals carrying the respective alleles to the Nex-Cre driver line, driving Cre expression to excitatory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and performed experiments on cultured cortical neurons derived from the offspring. Experiments in culture have the advantage that ANL labeling is direct and circumvents any variability arising from ANL administration or uptake into the brain. Comparison of 2-h ANL labeling in either 1xMetRS* or 3xMetRS* excitatory neurons (Nex-Cre::1xMetRS* and Nex-Cre::3xMetRS*) evaluated by FUNCAT showed that ANL labeling was approximately three times higher in neurons expressing 3xMetRS* (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. FUNCAT experiments in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) confirmed that the observed fluorescent signal was due to ANL incorporation into newly synthesized proteins and not due to detection of free ANL or ANL-charged tRNAs. Interestingly, we observed that the increased ANL labeling in the Nex-Cre::3xMetRS* line compared with Nex-Cre::1xMetRS* was accompanied by higher GFP expression&#8212;even though both lines carry one copy of GFP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Similarly, western blot comparisons of ANL labeling in 1xMetRS* or 3xMetRS* cultured neurons by BONCAT also showed an increase in ANL labeling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e,f</xref>). To examine whether the observed increase in labeling with the 3xMetRS* line was also evident in tissue, we prepared acute slices from brain tissue of adult Nex-Cre::1xMetRS* or 3xMetRS* mice and performed in vitro slice metabolic ANL (2&#8201;h) labeling experiments. As was observed in the cultured neurons, FUNCAT labeling was substantially elevated in slices expressing the 3xMetRS* transgene (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>).<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>MetRS* copy number influences ANL labeling.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Representative confocal images showing ANL labeling by FUNCAT after 2&#8201;h of incubation, in primary cortical neurons from Nex-Cre::1xMetRS* or Nex-Cre::3xMetRS* mice with (+) or without (&#8722;) ANL, showing an increase in labeling in the 3xMetRS* mouse line.

We observed only a slight increase in ANL labeling in 6xMetRS* versus 3xMetRS* in cultured neurons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>), suggesting that the maximal labeling may plateau under our conditions. In contrast to the copy number dependence of the ANL labeling, we found, as expected, that total protein synthesis levels, as assessed by puromycylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, were not different between heterozygous or homozygous 1xMetRS* and 3xMetRS* (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>). Thus, ANL incorporation depends, as expected, on Cre expression and the rank order of ANL incorporation scales depending on MetRS* expression. The scaling between ANL incorporation and encoded MetRS* copy number, however, was not linear and could be influenced by additional factors. For example, there could be a difference in the mRNA abundance of the transcripts transcribed from the 1xMetRS* and 3xMetRS* alleles. As the large expression cassette in the 3xMetRS* line (3.6&#8201;kb for 1xMetRS* versus 8.6&#8201;kb for 3xMetRS*) was expected to be transcribed and translated poorly, we added a WPRE stabilization element to this construct to ensure expression. As a result, the 3xMetRS* cassette expression may be higher. To understand whether mRNA abundance contributes to the superior performance of the 3xMetRS* line and the difference in GFP protein expression, we conducted fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments using probes to detect <italic toggle="yes">gfp</italic> mRNA, cell-type marker mRNAs (<italic toggle="yes">Gad2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Camk2a</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Bdnf</italic>) and the MetRS mRNA <italic toggle="yes">Mars1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

Indeed, ANL incorporation in Nex-Cre::3xMetRS* neurons was not only more pronounced than in Nex-Cre::1xMetRS* cultures; it was also not significantly inhibited by the presence of methionine in the growth medium, as observed in Nex-Cre::1xMetRS* neurons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

Furthermore, as expected, there was pronounced overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms related to neurons and synapses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g</xref>).

Complex organisms comprise hundreds of distinct cell types, each responding differently to identical physiological or pathological challenges owing to their specialization. The method described here uses the expression of a mutant MetRS*, which allows the incorporation of a bio-orthogonal analog of methionine (ANL) into proteins, enabling protein purification and increasing detection sensitivity by MS. In the present work, we compared a first-generation mouse line expressing one copy of the MetRS* enzyme per allele (1xMetRS*) with a second-generation line expressing three copies of MetRS* (3xMetRS*) per allele. In both mouse lines, MetRS* expression is Cre recombinase dependent. With the 3xMetRS* line, we increased the ANL labeling efficiency, reduced the time of labeling to study protein synthesis over a shorter time frame, and identified a cellular proteome in a very small population of DA neurons.</p><p id="Par17">One drawback of metabolic labeling with amino acid analogs is competition with the corresponding natural amino acid. To achieve effective labeling, experiments with the first-generation MetRS* line&#8212;both in vitro and in vivo&#8212;were necessarily conducted under methionine-free or methionine-reduced conditions to prevent competition between methionine and ANL. Here, we obtained strong labeling without altering physiological methionine concentrations. We demonstrated that cell type-specific protein identification is robust just 3&#8201;h after a single ANL IP injection. In addition, when comparing the proteins identified after 3&#8201;h with those identified after 6&#8201;hours, we identified protein pools with different half-lives, highlighting the potential of the 3xMetRS* system to study newly synthesized proteins that are missed with the 1xMetRS* system.</p><p id="Par18">The growing interest in the study of proteins and their behavior has led to the continuous development of methods and various techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Despite this progress, BONCAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, particularly ANL labeling, remains the most versatile method for studying protein homeostasis in vivo. The strength of this system lies in its cell type specificity, allowing in situ visualization of proteins, and its reliance on metabolic labeling. Depending on the labeling duration, ANL can be utilized to investigate different aspects of protein homeostasis: (1) studying protein synthesis by identifying proteins after brief labeling periods; (2) examining protein steady state or proteomes by identifying proteins after longer labeling periods that exceed the average half-lives of the proteins in the studied tissue or cell type; and (3) analyzing protein degradation by ceasing ANL administration after an initial labeling (<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0) and tracking the decrease of labeled proteins over time. Moreover, the possibility to identify the cell type-specific proteomes from one single animal opens the door to grouping mice on the basis of their behavior, for instance, opening a new dimension for functional studies. Other methods, such as puromycylation, are extensively used for studying protein synthesis owing to their high sensitivity. Puromycin is incorporated at any location within the translating protein. This method allows the investigation of protein synthesis after short labeling periods (for example, 5&#8211;10&#8201;min). However, prolonged labeling with puromycin can lead to cellular toxicity, and the method is not cell type specific. However, recent developments have enabled puromycin resistance or activation in identified cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Another useful approach is TurboID and its variations. This method relies on biotin binding to proteins in close proximity through an enzymatic reaction. Like puromycylation, BioID is highly efficient, allowing brief labeling periods. However, it is primarily used to study local proteomes or protein&#8211;protein interactions and is not suitable for studying protein synthesis, as it does not involve metabolic labeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, the BONCAT system is being expanded to include additional noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) such as AzY and AzF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, although so far no systematic comparison of their catalytic efficiency relative to MetRS*/ANL has been performed. BONCAT efficiency depends on many biological factors, including ncAA uptake, enzyme expression, codon usage and translational activity. The choice of the best BONCAT variant will depend on tissue, cell type, the exact experimental purpose and timing. For instance, the hydrophobicity of Phe and Tyr may reduce the accessibility of their ncAA analogs in folded proteins for applications such as live-cell labeling or FUNCAT, making ANL a more suitable choice for these applications; however, this might not be as important for BONCAT, which is performed under denaturing conditions. The combination of different BONCAT variants, either simultaneously or sequentially (for example, with the development of alkyne analogs of the ncAAs to allow pulse-chase experiments), will enrich the toolbox for studying protein dynamics and sensitivity.</p><p id="Par19">The 3xMetRS* line also enables the identification of proteomes from low-abundance neuronal populations, such as OB-DA neurons (representing just 6% of the cells in the bulb). Regrettably, we were for now unable to purify and identify the proteome from the DA neurons of the SN using a similar number of neurons as starting material. This may indicate that the protein synthesis rate of DA neurons in the bulb is higher, probably influenced by the retained capacity of the OB-DA neurons for postnatal proliferation. Indeed, this feature positions the OB-DA neurons as potential instruments for restorative treatments for PD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Transgenic animals</title><p id="Par20">For the new mouse line, the cassette&#8212;STOPFLOX-3x(MetRS*-2A)-GFP&#8212;is expressed under the CAG actin-derived promoter.

N-terminal methionine excision, methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications, with cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification. The maximum number of variable modifications per peptide was limited to 3. According to most of DIA-NN&#8217;s default settings, MS1 and MS2 mass accuracies, as well as scan windows, were set to 0; isotopologs and match-between-runs were enabled, while shared spectra were disabled. Protein inference was performed using genes with the heuristic protein inference option enabled. The neural network classifier was set to single-pass mode, and the quantification strategy was selected as &#8216;QuantUMS (high precision)&#8217;.

First, a comparison was performed based on valid protein quantifications in both conditions (&#8216;exclusivity approach&#8217;), and second, relative enrichment over control was examined (&#8216;enrichment approach&#8217;). For differential abundance analysis, a peptide-centric linear mixed-effect model as implemented in the msqRob algorithm in the MSDAP pipeline was used. Multiple testing correction was performed according to the Benjamini&#8211;Hochberg method. For the DA proteome, proteins were counted as exclusively quantified in the labeled samples (and thus part of the DA proteome) if four of seven DA samples and none of the negative control samples had valid protein quantifications. Significantly enriched proteins had to be quantified in at least four of seven labeled and one of five control samples, have a <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> value &lt;0.01 and show at least 1.5-fold enrichment over control (log<sub>2</sub> fold change ~0.58). For the excitatory proteome, proteins were exclusively quantified in the labeled samples (and thus part of the excitatory proteome) if five of six excitatory samples and none in the negative control samples had valid values. Significantly enriched proteins had to be quantified in at least five of six labeled and one of two control samples, have a <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> value &lt;0.01 and show at least threefold enrichment over the control (log<sub>2</sub> fold change ~1.58).

To compare the DA and excitatory neuronal proteomes with previously published studies, a gene-level approach was used to integrate the different datasets. Before merging, any information on protein isoforms (for example, protein half-life) was aggregated to gene IDs by their mean value.
