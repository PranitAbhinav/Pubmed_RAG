But traditional diagnostic techniques, like biopsies and mammograms, can require invasive procedures and lack accuracy. The non-invasive, quick, and accurate nature of machine learning (ML) and Raman spectroscopy (RS) in breast cancer diagnoses are examined in this review. Combining machine learning&#8217;s capacity to analyse intricate spectrum datasets with Raman spectroscopy&#8217;s ability to produce molecular fingerprints of biochemical alterations linked to cancer improves diagnostic precision. Using the PRISMA methodology, studies published from 2017 to 2024 were examined, with an emphasis on those that reported sensitivity and specificity values greater than 80%. With sensitivity and specificity frequently over 90%, the nine included studies show that Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning methods such as support vector machines, convolutional neural networks, and linear discriminant analysis yields good diagnostic metrics. The investigation highlights Raman spectroscopy&#8217;s adaptability in analysing biological material, such as tissues and serum, with prospective uses extending to intraoperative, real-time evaluations. Although encouraging, there are still issues that need to be resolved, like the requirement for common frameworks, multi-centre validation, and affordable technology. A thorough assessment of RS-ML applications is given by this study, which also offers insights into its therapeutic potential and directs future studies in breast cancer detection.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical trial number</title><p id="Par2">Not applicable</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10103-025-04597-3.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Systematic review</kwd><kwd>Raman spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>Machine learning</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">With around 2.3&#160;million new cases diagnosed each year, breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women and a major cause of cancer-related mortality, thereby making it one of the biggest worldwide health concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The likelihood of surviving for people with breast cancer is primarily determined by the stage of diagnosis, even with advancements in treatment methods. Early detection is essential for better survival rates. Advanced-stage disease and mortality may increase as a result of delayed diagnosis and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The use of conventional diagnostic techniques including MRI, ultrasound, and mammography has proved to be crucial for early detection. To validate diagnoses, these techniques rely on invasive procedures like biopsies, but they frequently lack sensitivity and specificity, especially in women who are younger with dense breast tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Conventional diagnostic techniques usually lack precision, which could postpone an accurate diagnosis. The gold standard for identifying a range of tumours is still conventional pathology examination, but clinical practice requires a precise, rapid, and non-invasive diagnostic tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Every biological sample possesses a distinct chemical makeup, resulting in unique vibrational patterns when examined through Raman spectroscopy. These spectral signatures reveal comprehensive molecular details about proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids within tissues and cells. By identifying these biochemical differences, Raman spectroscopy can accurately distinguish between cancerous and healthy cells and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Because it is non-invasive, requires a little sample preparation, and can analyse a wide range of biological samples, including tissues, serum, and saliva, Raman spectroscopy is a versatile technique for diagnosing breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The diagnostic capabilities of Raman spectroscopy have been greatly improved by the incorporation of machine learning methods. Large, complicated spectrum datasets can be handled well with machine learning, which makes it possible to recognize patterns and classify them with high sensitivity and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Based on unique molecular signals, Raman spectroscopy has proven to be able to differentiate between different cancerous and non-cancerous cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Notwithstanding these positive developments, a number of challenges remain until Raman spectroscopy&#8217;s clinical use for cancer diagnosis becomes widely accepted. The need for consistent analytical frameworks, differences in spectrum collection techniques, and sample preparation heterogeneity are some of the main obstacles. Furthermore, to validate the diagnostic accuracy and repeatability of Raman spectroscopy across a variety of patient populations, comprehensive, multicentre research is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The goal of this review is to thoroughly examine research on the use of Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with machine learning approaches for breast cancer diagnosis that was between 2017 and 2024. We want to assess the diagnostic accuracy of Raman spectroscopy, investigate its possible clinical uses, and pinpoint knowledge gaps by combining data from various investigations. By conducting this analysis, we want to offer insights that will direct future investigations and make it easier to include Raman spectroscopy and machine learning into standard clinical procedures for the diagnosis of breast cancer.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Raman spectroscopy</title><p id="Par6">Named after C.V. Raman, Raman spectroscopy is an analytical method that uses light scattering to quantify the vibrational modes of molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The dispersed light, which is a feature of molecular bonding, gives information about the structure of the sample This procedure makes it possible to identify rotational, vibrational and other molecule states, which makes it an effective way to examine chemical compositions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">There are two types of Raman scattering: inelastic and elastic. There is no change in the light&#8217;s wavelength in elastic scattering, like Rayleigh scattering. Depending on the molecular vibrational levels, the scattered light in inelastic scattering, sometimes referred to as Raman scattering, shows a wavelength change. Anti-Stokes Raman scattering (blueshift) occurs when the scattered photon gains energy, while Stokes Raman scattering (redshift) occurs when the photon loses energy (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The difference between incident and scattered light wavelengths is known as the Raman shift, and it is a crucial parameter in Raman spectroscopy. It makes it possible to compare spectra from various lasers in a meaningful way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Illustration of Raman scattering showing how molecules interact with excitation light to produce Rayleigh, Stokes, and Anti-Stokes scattering&#8217;s effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]</p></caption><graphic id="MO1" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="10103_2025_4597_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Types of Raman spectroscopy</title><p id="Par8">More than 25 specialized methods have been developed using Raman spectroscopy. The incoherent process of spontaneous Raman Scattering causes scattered photons to show changes in energy levels based on molecular interactions. Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) amplifies Raman signals by utilizing nanostructured metallic surfaces, enabling highly sensitive detection of low-concentration biomarkers. Nevertheless, inconsistencies in nanoparticle synthesis pose reproducibility challenges, limiting its reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) combines scanning probe microscopy with Raman spectroscopy, achieving nanoscale spatial resolution ideal for subcellular imaging. Although it offers high sensitivity, its complex instrumentation and lengthy scanning times hinder its practicality in clinical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) is a nonlinear Raman method that facilitates label-free, rapid imaging of biological tissues with excellent molecular specificity. However, despite, its fast data acquisition, CARS is affected by background noise, which can cause spectral distortions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Because of its excellent specificity and sensitivity, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is one of the most commonly employed method in the detection of early-stage cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

The workflow typically involves several steps: first, acquiring spectral data from biological samples; second, performing pre-processing procedures such as baseline correction, smoothing, normalization, and removal of cosmic rays; third, extracting relevant spectral features; and finally, applying statistical and machine learning models for classification and interpretation. These steps ensure that spectral data is interpreted accurately and consistently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Machine learning</title><p id="Par10">Machine learning is increasingly used in Raman spectrum analysis, particularly for cancer detection. It involves training algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions from spectral data, enhancing the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of Raman spectroscopy. Machine learning techniques are broadly categorized into supervised learning, which relies on labeled data for classification and regression tasks, and unsupervised learning, which is used to discover hidden structures in unlabelled data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. All the included studies employed supervised learning techniques. The following models were most frequently applied, demonstrating robust diagnostic performance in classifying Raman spectra for breast cancer diagnosis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the commonly used models. It finds the best boundary that separates different classes, making it effective for distinguishing between two groups, like cancerous and non-cancerous cells. SVM performs well even with small data sets and is good at avoiding overfitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are another powerful tool, particularly for pattern recognition. They have multiple layers that automatically learn complex features from spectral data, helping to identify intricate patterns and improving classification accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is often used to reduce the number of variables by projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space while keeping different classes separate. This makes the classification process more efficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and uses the majority vote or average prediction for the final result. It is highly accurate, reduces overfitting, and works well with imbalanced datasets, making it suitable for complex spectral data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Neural Network Language Model (NNLM) is designed for sequence prediction tasks and is effective in learning spectral patterns. It predicts subsequent data points by understanding the contextual relationship within spectral sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].<fig id="Fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Supervised machine learning classification models applied for breast cancer diagnosis using raman spectroscopy</p></caption><graphic id="MO3" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="10103_2025_4597_Fig3_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Meta analysis and PRISMA chart</title><p id="Par11">A statistical method for combining data from several research to produce solid results is called meta-analysis.

High sensitivity reduces false negatives, which is critical for early diagnosis, whereas high specificity minimizes false positives, improving overall diagnostic precision. Funnel plots were constructed using the ggplot2 package in R to visualize the relationship between effect size (sensitivity/specificity) on the x-axis and standard error on the y-axis. Additionally, forest plots were created to summarize the diagnostic performance of Raman spectroscopy across studies. These plots present the individual sensitivity and specificity estimates from each study, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and include the pooled estimates derived from meta-analysis. In cases where CIs were not reported, they were calculated using the available sensitivity, specificity, and sample size data. A narrow CI indicates greater precision and consistency, while a wider CI suggests higher variability across studies. Forest plots enhance visual interpretation by allowing comparisons of effect sizes and precision across studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Result and discussion</title><p id="Par18">The methods, effectiveness, and therapeutic implications of the combination of Raman spectroscopy and machine learning for breast cancer diagnosis are examined in this review, which extracts its data from nine investigations. With a varied number of sample sizes, the investigations used a variety of sample types, such as serum, breast tissue specimens, blood and cell cultures. Serum&#8217;s sensitivity to biochemical changes in cancer patients and simplicity of collection has made it the most useful medium. One of the included studies investigated the application of serum Raman spectroscopy combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for rapid breast cancer screening. A total of 333 serum samples were analysed, achieving a sensitivity of 93.2% and specificity of 95.1%. These metrics demonstrated the robustness of SVM in classifying spectral patterns associated with cancer biomarkers, highlighting its potential as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for early cancer detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In another investigation, serum SERS technology using thermally annealed silver nanoparticle composite substrates was integrated with SVM to detect breast cancer. Despite, a relatively small sample size of 28 serum samples, this approach achieved perfect sensitivity and specificity (100%). The enhanced signal clarity provided by the SERS substrates was attributed to the amplification of cancer-related spectral features, demonstrating the high diagnostic accuracy achievable with optimized sample preparation techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. To profile tumour heterogeneity and classify breast cancer subtypes, Random Forest was employed with SERS data. Analysing 124 serum samples, the model achieved a sensitivity of 97.8% and specificity of 92.2%. Random Forest&#8217;s robustness to overfitting and ability to handle complex spectral variations were evident in its accurate classification of cancer subtypes, underlining its potential for personalized cancer treatment approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Another study utilized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to diagnose ductal carcinoma in situ and breast cancer from serum samples. This model was tested on a large dataset of 804 serum samples and achieved a sensitivity of 98.5% and specificity of 97.2%, demonstrating high scalability and reliability for population-wide screening. The CNN&#8217;s layered architecture enabled effective pattern recognition, ensuring high diagnostic precision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The combination of SERS with a two-dimensional CNN and Gramian Angular Field transformation was evaluated for breast cancer screening using 128 serum samples. This model demonstrated a sensitivity of 98.65% and specificity of 97.67%. The 2D CNN&#8217;s capability to capture complex spatial features significantly enhanced classification accuracy, highlighting the advantages of deep learning in spectral image analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Finally, transformer based language models was applied for rapid breast cancer diagnosis using 271 serum samples, achieving perfect sensitivity and specificity (100%). The model&#8217;s sequence prediction capability effectively captured spectral patterns, showcasing its potential for real-time cancer diagnostics and emphasizing the growing relevance of neural networks in spectral data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Breast tissue samples were primarily used to differentiate malignant tissues from normal tissues while cultured breast cancer and normal mammary epithelial cells were studied to identify biochemical differences. The classification of breast cancer tissue samples was explored using a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). This model was tested on 40 tissue samples and achieved a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 86%. The high sensitivity reflected the model&#8217;s capability to accurately detect cancerous tissues, though the lower specificity suggested some misclassification of non-cancerous samples. This highlights the importance of further optimization to reduce false-positive rates in tissue diagnostics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Similarly, another study involving tissue samples combined Raman spectroscopy with Support Vector Machine and reported 93% and 95% sensitivity and specificity respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Raman micro-spectroscopy combined with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was utilized to distinguish breast cancer cells from normal mammary epithelial cells. After analyzing 60 cell line samples, this model achieved a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 100%. The high classification accuracy illustrated LDA&#8217;s strength in dimensionality reduction and enhanced class separability, particularly effective in handling high-dimensional spectral data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Many investigations used surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which improves signal clarity by using substrates based on silver or gold nanoparticles. The spectrum sensitivity and reproducibility were further enhanced by sophisticated substrates designs, such as AgNPs/PSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Across the reviewed studies, a range of preprocessing methods were applied to enhance Raman spectral data prior to machine learning analysis. For baseline correction, common techniques included asymmetric least squares (ALS) and polynomial fitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Noise reduction methods included Savitzky-Golay smoothing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For normalization max-min scaling, and area normalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] were employed. To extract important features from the spectral data, more sophisticated approaches like GAF (Gramian Angular Field) transformation, dimensionality reduction strategies like PCA and multivariate curve resolution (MCR-ALS) were also used.</p><p id="Par23">While many studies report high diagnostic performance of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), it is important to interpret such findings with caution. Some works, including [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], report high sensitivity and specificity without addressing potential variability, overfitting, or lack of validation. Recent evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] have highlighted concerns regarding exaggerated diagnostic claims in SERS-based liquid biopsy studies. These findings underline the need for rigorous standardization, reproducible protocols, and large-scale, blinded validation cohorts to truly establish the clinical utility of SERS in early cancer detection.</p><p id="Par24">The wide range of machine learning models included Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as well as more conventional models like support vector machine (SVM) and PCA-Linear Discriminant Analysis (PCA-LDA). With excellent metrics, the CNN models achieved high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. In classification accuracy, SVM and 1D-CNN showcased strong performance with augmented datasets, but generally trailed 2D-CNN, which demonstrated robust performance with datasets that are not augmented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The potential of these methods for accurate cancer detection was demonstrated by the fact that accuracy varied from 92 to 100% across trials, with sensitivity and specificity scores often exceeding 90%.</p><p id="Par25">While SVM and CNN models have demonstrated high classification performance in Raman-based breast cancer diagnosis, it is important to acknowledge their limitations. Recent studies have shown that ML models, especially SVM and Random Forest, can produce inflated accuracy metrics when applied to small or non-representative datasets without robust validation (L. A. Bratchenko &amp; Bratchenko [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This underscores the necessity of using independent test sets, rigorous cross-validation, and transparency in reporting model training processes to ensure reproducibility and generalizability of results.</p><p id="Par26">Additionally, a review of the studies included revealed consistent trends in the experimental design and analytical targets. The most frequently employed Raman excitation wavelength was 785&#160;nm, due to its optimal balance between penetration depth, signal intensity, and minimized fluorescence background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Serum was the most commonly analyzed biological matrix, offering a non-invasive, easily obtainable, and biochemically informative medium for detecting cancer-associated metabolic alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Important Raman spectral features crucial for differentiating malignant from healthy samples included peaks associated with phenylalanine (~&#8201;1002&#8211;1004&#160;cm&#8315;&#185;), amide III bands (~&#8201;1246&#8211;1285&#160;cm&#8315;&#185;), amide I bands (~&#8201;1576&#8211;1600&#160;cm&#8315;&#185;), lipid and phospholipid-related vibrations (~&#8201;1437&#8211;1445&#160;cm&#8315;&#185;), and DNA/RNA backbone signals (~&#8201;784&#8211;785&#160;cm&#8315;&#185;), highlighting their vital roles in cancer detection.

These approaches are a promising addition to conventional diagnostic procedures such as imaging and histology because of their high sensitivity and specificity. Translation into clinical practice is hampered by constraints like small sample size, single-centre datasets, reliance on pre-processing, augmentation, and the requirement for specialized technology. Furthermore, even while experimental results are encouraging, large-scale, multi-centre trials are necessary to validate these approaches and guarantee their generalizability and dependability in clinical settings. Widespread use is also hampered by the requirement for specific substrates and Raman spectrometers, especially in environments with limited resources. Additionally, the review&#8217;s inclusion criteria prioritized studies reporting sensitivity and specificity values above 80%, which, while intended to focus on high-performance diagnostic models, may have excluded potentially valuable studies with lower diagnostic metrics or smaller datasets. Future reviews could benefit from incorporating a broader range of studies, including those with modest diagnostic performance, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the field&#8217;s progression.</p><p id="Par28">Despite, all the drawbacks, this analysis highlights how Raman spectroscopy and machine learning have the potential to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics by providing a non-invasive, effective, and scalable solution that may enhance early detection and supplement conventional techniques.</p><p id="Par29">The details of each individual study have been listed and tabulated in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of studies included in the analysis evaluating Raman spectroscopy for breast cancer detection and diagnosis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Sl.
