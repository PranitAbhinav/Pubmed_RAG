If uncontrolled, it leads to unfavourable maternal and foetal outcomes. Preconception care offers healthcare providers and women with diabetes an opportunity to minimise risk factors before pregnancy. However, the utilisation of this service in the public health clinics remains limited. This study aimed to explore the challenges experienced by healthcare providers in implementing preconception care for women with diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This was a qualitative study that employed a single case study approach. Participants were purposely recruited for focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. An interview guide, developed based on the Theoretical Domain Framework, was used. All interviews were conducted at four public health clinics in a state with a high prevalence of diabetes in Malaysia. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were then analysed through thematic analysis, using a reflexive approach with an inductive strategy. Ethical approval was obtained from the Medical Research Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health Malaysia.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Fifty-three healthcare providers involved in preconception care were interviewed. Three major themes affecting the provision and delivery of preconception care for women with diabetes were identified: (1) Systemic and organisational barriers which create foundational barriers, (2) Healthcare provider factors which affect frontline implementation, and (3) Patient-related factors which influence the engagement of women with diabetes in utilising preconception care. This study identifies gaps within healthcare systems and providers, as well as factors influencing women with diabetes that need to be addressed for effective implementation of preconception care.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">This study offers insights into the challenges of implementing preconception care effectively. Within the healthcare system, instead of segregating management within similar healthcare facilities, consolidating resources could address manpower and infrastructure challenges. Providing comprehensive training for healthcare providers is crucial to improve care quality and health literacy among women with diabetes. Successful implementation relies on effective engagement between healthcare providers and the women. In this way, preconception care can be recognised as an essential component of the diabetes management pathway within the healthcare system in the country.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12875-025-02991-y.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Diabetes</kwd><kwd>Diabetes in pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Healthcare providers</kwd><kwd>Healthcare system</kwd><kwd>Preconception care</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universiti Malaya</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">In Malaysia, diabetes presents a significant public health challenge due to its high prevalence and increasing trend. It adversely impacts the quality of life, placing a considerable burden on healthcare systems and contributing to economic challenges. The National Health and Morbidity Survey 2023 reported that 15.6%, or one in six adults, in Malaysia has diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The incidence of diabetes in pregnancy (DIP) is also alarming, exhibiting a consistent upward trend, increasing from 14.8% in 2018 to 18.1% in 2019 and reaching 21.9% in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. DIP poses risks to both the mother and the developing foetus, significantly affecting pregnancy outcomes. In Malaysia, the prevalence of DIP-related stillbirth rose from 7.55 in 2013 to 19.6 in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and approximately 10% of DIP cases result in congenital malformations, particularly when glucose levels remain uncontrolled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In comparison to normal pregnancy, DIP also resulted in a higher rate of instrumental and caesarean deliveries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Gestational diabetes (GDM) accounts for the most significant proportion of DIP, reported at approximately 22% of diabetes in Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Pregestational diabetes (PGD) constitutes a smaller proportion, yet it has a considerable impact. It is documented that the pregnancy rates among women with PGD have increased from 0.30% in 2019 to 0.34% in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Obstetricians strongly recommend that mothers with PGD carefully plan their pregnancies. Women with diabetes should attain optimal diabetes management before conceiving to secure favourable outcomes. It is essential for them to obtain preconception care (PCC), more importantly, to manage their blood glucose and weight effectively before beginning their pregnancy journey.</p><p id="Par6">PCC aims to improve maternal and child health outcomes by enhancing the health status of both parents. It offers biomedical, behavioural and social health interventions from before conception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. An important strategy to reduce adverse health outcomes from DIP is adequate pregnancy planning. Although PCC provides family doctors and their patients with an opportunity to discuss and mitigate risk factors before pregnancy, more than 60% of deceased mothers did not utilise family planning intended to optimise their blood glucose levels before conceiving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Given the high diabetes burden in the country, PCC in Malaysia has largely targeted mothers or women with chronic medical illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In Malaysia, women of reproductive age with diabetes who do not intend to conceive or have not achieved an optimal metabolic environment to conceive are usually offered family planning by the PCC clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Even though women with high-risk pregnancies who use family planning are expected to be more likely to undergo PCC, the overall utilisation of this service remains low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The prevalence of family planning use among women with diabetes varied, ranging from 4.8 to 89.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Women with diabetes were reported to be less likely to utilise any family planning methods compared to women without diabetes mellitus (8). These are individuals who are most in need of PCC but are often the least likely to receive counselling in PCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Healthcare providers (HCPs) have also observed that this service is suboptimally delivered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The uptake of pre-pregnancy care clinics was reported to be low among women with high-risk pregnancies, including those with diabetes, a state located north of Peninsular Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The low use of family planning services and pre-pregnancy care clinics among these women brings up important questions about how well PCC is being implemented in Malaysia. The increasing prevalence of DIP in Malaysia represents a significant concern that necessitates a multifaceted approach to both prevention and management. In this context, addressing this issue through preconception care as a preparatory measure before pregnancy is of utmost importance.</p><p id="Par7">Many studies have identified the factors influencing the utilisation of PCC among women, but limited studies have evaluated this service from the perspectives of HCPs, especially in Malaysia, where the sociocultural, religious, and demographic backgrounds of women with diabetes and HCPs vary. This study aimed to explore the challenges experienced by HCPs in implementing PCC for women with diabetes in public health clinics in Malaysia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participant recruitment</title><p id="Par8">This was a qualitative study that employed a single case study approach using an embedded single case design. A case study allows in-depth, multi-faceted empirical explorations of the phenomena of interest in their natural real-life settings and is particularly applicable to answer research questions pertaining to &#8220;how&#8221;, and &#8220;why&#8221; a program runs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This design helps to explore the challenges faced by key stakeholders that are involved in the implementation of PCC for women with diabetes, and in this context, are the healthcare providers (HCPs). The case study focuses on the PCC program in NS, Malaysia, one of the states with a high prevalence of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Before the interviews began, the main author met with the clinic&#8217;s manager to ensure transparency, align mutual expectations, and identify potential participants.</p><p id="Par9">Participants were purposely sampled to capture diverse perspectives. The nurses, assistant medical officers (AMOs), medical officers (MOs), diabetes educators (DEs) and Family Medicine Specialists (FMS) who were directly involved in the management of women with diabetes were invited for the study. They were from two urban and two rural public health clinics located in the state of southwest Peninsular Malaysia to explore whether locality would give a different view. All participants were assigned pseudonyms and provided with a brief overview of the study protocol via an information sheet. Verbal and written informed consent for the interview, audio recording, and observation were obtained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par10">Most interviews involving nurses, AMOs, MOs, and DEs were conducted via focus group discussions (FGDs). FGDs allow interactive discussions among participants with mixed levels of knowledge and experience on the topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Each FGD consists of two to four participants. The sessions were arranged according to the availability of HCPs, resulting in fewer participants than the ideal number recommended for a focus group discussion (FGD) session. Conversely, in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with the FMSs, who serve as key informants. These key informant interviews were important because in Malaysia, FMSs lead and oversee clinical care and develop the standard operating procedures for PCC in clinics. Moreover, conducting IDIs with the key informants helps mitigate the power imbalances that might influence the interviews with their subordinates, which could occur during focus group discussions (FGDs). A total of 28 MOs and FMSs were interviewed via eight FGDs and five IDIs, while 25 nurses, AMOs and DEs were interviewed via nine FGDs and one IDI. The FGDs and IDIs lasted on average 90&#160;min and 60&#160;min, respectively. Each participant was interviewed only once. All interviews took place over an eight-month period, from January to August 2018. The FGDs and IDIs were guided by an interview guide (Appendix A) developed based on the construct of the Theoretical Domain Framework (TDF) that was used to explain the behaviours of HCPs during various clinical practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The TDF framework specifies barriers and enablers at multiple levels, explaining the influences on implementation outcomes and the relationships between the determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The interviews were conducted by the primary author, who was trained as a qualitative researcher. Other authors who were also qualitative researchers assisted with the analysis. To ensure the credibility of the study, the transcripts were returned to seven participants for member checks, and all participants agreed with the interpretation of their views. Interviewer bias was minimized by using a reflexivity journal and peer debriefing with the research team, ensuring data collection and analysis were not influenced by the researchers&#8217; personal identities, background or interests. The reflexivity journal documented the interviewer&#8217;s thoughts, assumptions, and emotional reactions experienced during the interviews. The dependability of data was ensured through triangulation, involving observation field notes and relevant archival materials, such as the PCC registry, perinatal care manual, and patients&#8217; records, to add contextual meaning to the participants&#8217; interviews.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par11">The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the detailed transcriptions were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis (RTA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] with an inductive strategy. The three phases were as follows: Phase 1: Familiarisation. The team members repeatedly listened to the first three recordings reviewed, reflected on the transcripts, and subsequently helped synthesise insights from the data. Field notes were also used to provide context for the data. Phase 2: Coding. An iterative process was employed, starting with descriptive coding and followed by discussions among the research team to develop shared definitions of the codes. The team used NVivo version 10 (QSR International, Burlington, Massachusetts, USA) to assist with the coding. Phase 3: Generating themes. The codes were later collated into broader themes based on similar meanings and concepts that reflected the experiences of HCPs managing women with diabetes. The codes were constantly compared across different interviews over several meetings to ascertain meanings and prevent duplication of codes and themes. Disagreements on certain codes were resolved by re-examining the meaning of the codes and referring to the objectives. Finally, the team arrived at the final themes. The COREQ checklist (Appendix B) was used to ensure the quality of reporting for this article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ethical consideration</title><p id="Par12">Ethical approval was obtained from the Medical Research Ethics Committee [NMRR-17-1613-36439].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><p id="Par13">A total of 53 participants (28 were FMSs and MOs and 25 were nurses, AMOs and diabetes educators) were interviewed.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>1. Theme 1: systemic and organisational barriers</title><p id="Par17">Participants revealed that, systemic and organisational barriers to implementing PCC in primary care clinics include issues related to integration deficit such as poor integration of PCC into current diabetes care models, fragmented or segregated services, inadequate medical record systems to include PCC, and a lack of emphasis on PCC in key performance indicators. These challenges are compounded by resource and infrastructure gaps, including the lack of dedicated spaces and inadequate guidance for PCC implementation. Additionally, the lack of gender-personalised care services does not fully address the needs of women with diabetes for PCC.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Integration deficits</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>PCC not embedded in existing diabetes programs</title><p id="Par18">The existing diabetes programs did not embed PCC in the workflow. In addition, the participants revealed that the lack of priority setting by policymakers is also evident in the limited publicity or health promotion regarding PCC, both in the community and within clinics. Many educational programmes for women with diabetes are commonly centred on pregnancy and seldom include pre-pregnancy care.<disp-quote><p id="Par19">&#8220;<italic toggle="yes">Our health education in the public clinic is more towards diabetes&#8230; Only when they are pregnant will we start telling about diabetes in pregnancy&#8230;it is quite rare that we gather patients</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> educate them about this.&#8221;</italic> [Dr C, FMS, rural clinic].</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Segregation of the service</title><p id="Par20">The specialist trainees felt that the separation of physical space, workforce and delivery systems in some clinics, compared with conventional healthcare systems, contributes to the effective transfer of information regarding the reproductive backgrounds of patients. They felt that the healthcare delivery is not well integrated. The care of women with diabetes focuses mainly on managing their diabetes at the diabetes clinic while pregnancy and pre-pregnancy planning are handled at the maternal and child health clinic.<disp-quote><p id="Par21">&#8220;<italic toggle="yes">We have it (PCC) in MCH (maternal child health) but not in OPD (out-patient department). No reproductive part there</italic>&#8221;. [Dr H, urban clinic]</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par22">The doctors realised that the lack of continuity of care resulted when care shifts from one unit (e.g. diabetes outpatient unit) to another (e.g. maternal and child health unit) even within the same clinic facility.<disp-quote><p id="Par23">&#8220;<italic toggle="yes">There is no continuity of care because we divide our clinics into MCH and OPD.

[Dr I, urban clinic]</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Not prioritised in key performance metrics</title><p id="Par24">While PCC should ideally complement the diabetes care, participants perceived PCC is given less emphasis within the diabetes programme. Thus, there is a lack of motivation to offer and promote PCC to women with diabetes, since these activities would not benefit them. Many healthcare personnel do not see PCC as an important healthcare intervention with significant implications.<disp-quote><p id="Par25"><italic toggle="yes">"&#8230;it (PCC) is not a KPI (key performance indicator).

However, the participants mentioned that the existing system does not seem to capture information on PCC comprehensively. The current manual documentation (referred to as the green book) for the care of women with diabetes includes dedicated columns for most indicators of diabetes quality, but none for reproductive indicators such as menstrual date, contraception use or family planning. Nurse A, a diabetic educator whose role is to screen these women for pregnancy risks, expressed;<disp-quote><p id="Par28">&#8220;<italic toggle="yes">&#8230;.no space to ask on family planning in the green book.

Even in clinics with a computerised medical record system, reproductive issues were not clearly documented in the system.<disp-quote><p id="Par30">&#8220;<italic toggle="yes">Because there&#8217;s no such template to do such a thing in the computerised system.

They inferred that the differences in practices stem from insufficient training among doctors and support staff. The lack of standard guidelines worsens this issue.<disp-quote><p id="Par34"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;For me</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I have not had any training in PCC and my knowledge about all these contraception is very poor</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> so I&#8217;m not very comfortable doing this kind of counselling&#8221;</italic> [Dr M, urban clinic].</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par35">They also noted that diabetes training assigns less focus to PCC, and diabetic educators, who play a crucial role in the diabetes programme, do not receive targeted training in PCC during their advanced specialty education training. Nurse F, a diabetic educator emphasised the need for PCC training in diabetes.<disp-quote><p id="Par36">&#8220;.,<italic toggle="yes">. we are not really trained. There isn&#8217;t any input (on PCC) during the 6 months of DE (diabetic educator) training. It&#8217;s more of a general input. I think we really ought to have training on PCC because we need to know the flow of delivery&#8221;.</italic> [Nurse F, urban clinic]</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par37">Some participants shared that inadequate structured supervision by higher health authorities also contributes to the challenges in PCC training. Dr K highlighted that the continuous medical education in PCC ceases when the higher administrative office stops monitoring the training schedule. This is in contrast with the diabetes programme, where the quality improvement process is structured and continuously monitored.<disp-quote><p id="Par38">&#8220;<italic toggle="yes">No more demand</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> so we stop.

Regardless of the clinic location, some participants had not come across any standard general or specific guideline on PCC.<disp-quote><p id="Par40">&#8220;<italic toggle="yes">There is no guideline to assist with PCC and family planning</italic>&#8221;. [Dr L, urban clinic]</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par41">Consequently, the PCC delivery was tailored to fit the clinic&#8217;s culture and the preferences of staff, especially nurses. They offered care and communicated information about PCC based on their personal understanding.<disp-quote><p id="Par42"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;No SOP (standard operating procedure).

The system was not designed to meet women&#8217;s expectations for gender-personalised care. The current healthcare system randomly assigns any doctor to any patient regardless of gender, illness or complaint. This affects the disclosure of sensitive issues, such as pregnancy and family planning.<disp-quote><p id="Par45">&#8220; <italic toggle="yes">Sometimes a female patient requires a female doctor to talk about sensitive issues. But our system doesn&#8217;t allow patients to request doctors</italic>.&#8221; [Nurse L, rural clinic].</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par46">The participants felt that patients prefer female doctors for discussing pregnancy-related issues, which limits male doctors&#8217; exposure to these topics. Additionally, the requirement for a chaperone for a male doctor during consultations can prevent the disclosure of sensitive matters. Dr. R, a male medical officer, admitted to having barriers when discussing PCC.<disp-quote><p id="Par47">&#8220;<italic toggle="yes">Pregnancy planning</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">.it didn&#8217;t cross my mind.

HCPs&#8217; personal and professional values, including their attitudes toward PCC, religious beliefs, and gaps in gender sensitivity, influenced how care is delivered. Additionally, inadequate knowledge and team dynamics further undermine the quality and effectiveness of PCC.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Personal and professional values</title><sec id="Sec24"><title>HCP attitudes toward PCC</title><p id="Par49">The participants identified certain personal factors, including being male, impatience, and a lackadaisical attitude towards PCC, as reasons for the lack of PCC provided to women with diabetes. However, one of the participants expressed that having a strong personality does not always align with the expected positive professional consultation.<disp-quote><p id="Par50">&#8220;<italic toggle="yes">I&#8217;m not a very patient doctor. I want to settle things very fast</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> sometimes maybe my voice also is not soft. I don&#8217;t get women telling me about reproductive issues&#8221;</italic>. [Dr M, urban clinic]</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par51">Additionally, attitude plays a crucial supportive role in maintaining the continuity of patient care. Dr. Z noted that some doctors appeared to lack enthusiasm and commitment in delivering patient care.</p><p id="Par52">&#8220;<italic toggle="yes">Reason (for the lack of PCC) is you are not responsible for your own patients&#8230;because you (transit doctors) are not seeing your patients again .so you feel like someone else will settle this&#8230;Very lackadaisical!&#8221;</italic> [Dr Z, urban clinic].</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Influence of personal or religious beliefs</title><p id="Par53">One of the participants in one of the FGDs indicated that the religious beliefs of HCP influence the provision of personalised PCC.

Many healthcare providers lack expertise and skills related to PCC, often rely on non-holistic clinical approaches, and faced challenges with teamwork and collaboration. These gaps have hindered the delivery of coordinated, patient-centered care and limited the effectiveness of PCC in clinical practice.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Insufficient PCC-related expertise</title><p id="Par58">Participants also highlighted that many HCPs lack sufficient knowledge and practical experience with PCC, which is important for effectively practicing PCC.

Theme 1 highlights that PCC was not fully integrated into Malaysia&#8217;s healthcare system, particularly in the management of diabetes, one of the country&#8217;s leading non-communicable diseases. Despite significant efforts to optimise diabetes management, the study indicates that PCC remains an underrepresented component within the diabetes care pathway. Additionally, the findings underscore the urgent need to create an environment conducive to personalised care, emphasising its importance for improved health outcomes. Theme 2 describes how HCPs&#8217; personal values can affect their approach to women&#8217;s reproductive issues with diabetes. It also highlights how the work culture, which sometimes did not align with the recommended standards of professionalism in medicine, played a role in influencing their management strategies. Theme 3 illustrated how the women&#8217;s lack of pregnancy planning impacted HCPs&#8217; approach to PCC among these women. HCPs often deemed PCC unnecessary if the women did not bring up related concerns. These factors shaped HCPs&#8217; considerations on PCC for women with diabetes.</p><p id="Par93">Our findings reveal that PCC is not systematically embedded within existing diabetes management programs in Malaysia, resulting in missed opportunities for early intervention and comprehensive care. This is consistent with studies from the UK and the US, where PCC for women with diabetes is often poorly integrated into routine care, leading to low uptake and suboptimal outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For example, a UK qualitative study found that both general practitioners (GPs) and secondary care professionals recognised the lack of clear policies and guidelines as a barrier to effective PCC delivery, echoing the need for better integration and clearer division of responsibilities between primary and secondary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The healthcare system is integral to achieving an excellent outcome in any health program. A well-coordinated PCC service for women with diabetes is recognised as an important component of primary care delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Coordinated care is provider- and payer-centric, assisting patients in navigating the complex health system at different levels of care; whereas, care integration is more person-centric, focusing on developing better strategies to deliver care for improved outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Malaysia needs both a coordinated and integrated PCC for women with diabetes especially in the primary care setting. Primary care providers are ideally positioned to manage reproductive-aged women with diabetes before, between, and after their pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, it is beneficial to incorporate components of PCC into various areas of diabetes care, such as routine diabetic management and existing family planning services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This is reported by a Dutch study, which emphasises that an integrated PCC programme is essential to ensure the successful delivery of PCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par94">Similar to our situation, international studies have reported that diabetes care, reproductive health, and family planning services are often delivered in silos, resulting in fragmented care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In providing quality service in an organised, effective, and efficient manner to women with chronic diseases, all levels of care must be coordinated concurrently and not operate in silos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This is supported by the three pillars of good integration of care: (1) identify a shared vision and community, (2) leverage shared platforms, and (3) work towards shared alignment of incentives and accountability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Rhyming the general diabetes care, PCC, and family planning for women with diabetes will encourage HCPs and patients to share their vision on a common platform. However, it has been recognised by others and in this study that care fragmentation is a challenge in managing women with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Women with diabetes have also expressed concerns about the lack of collaboration among various healthcare departments and the challenges posed by different levels within healthcare facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The lack of communication between HCPs at various levels appears to stem from the structure of the healthcare system itself and is a well-known issue among HCPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Providing PCC should ideally be integrated into routine care rather than offered as a specialised service. However, this presents significant challenges due to the need for multidisciplinary collaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A local survey of family physicians revealed a preference for integrating personalised care into public healthcare clinic services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], presenting an opportunity to include PCC in the management of diabetes for the general population.</p><p id="Par95">The lack of prioritisation of PCC in organisational key performance index (KPI) is not unique to Malaysia. Studies from high-income countries also noted that, despite evidence supporting the effectiveness of PCC, it is often not a measured or incentivised aspect of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The absence of robust electronic medical records (EMR) is a significant barrier in the current setting. Medical audits and quality improvement efforts have shown that systematically documenting PCC pregnancy risks in an EMR can significantly assist doctors in delivering optimal PCC, an effort to improve the quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Incomplete documentation of reproductive health risks is ineffective data and reduces the chances of offering comprehensive PCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Technological tools, with an emphasis on the use of EMR, are crucial for sharing information between necessary stakeholders to facilitate communication within and between different levels of care, thereby providing good documentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. EMR is a comprehensive data source that records all preconception health risk factors. However, it can only be effectively used for assessment if the data is complete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. When supported by thorough documentation in the EMR, it can act as a checklist to ensure that all essential areas of care are covered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Even GPs and nurses consider EMR to be a valid and practical tool for identifying preconception health risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Nonetheless, a significant challenge cited by numerous institutions is the initial investment and ongoing maintenance costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], highlighting the vital role of public health authorities in coordinating these services. Furthermore, healthcare organisations must ensure the safety and confidentiality of patient information within the EMR system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. </p><p id="Par96">Our findings, that HCPs lack clear, practical guidelines for integrating PCC into existing workflows, are mirrored in other studies. A UK study, for instance, found that GPs and other healthcare providers cited a need for more explicit protocols and support to deliver PCC effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The lack of standardised guidelines leads to inconsistent practices and missed intervention opportunities. Developing and implementing clear guidelines, along with strategies to enhance PCC awareness, is crucial for achieving full PCC adoption and improving HCPs&#8217; knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In regard to infrastructure, there is a lack of dedicated spaces for PCC in our public health clinics, along with no established framework for gender-personalised PCC services, which can compromise privacy and the quality of care. Similar resource constraints have been reported in another low- and middle-income country, where limited infrastructure hinder the delivery of comprehensive diabetes and reproductive health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Having adequate consultation spaces that respect women&#8217;s privacy may promote the uptake of PCC service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Addressing these resource shortages requires policy, financial, and political advocacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], which can pose significant challenges to providing high-quality PCC.</p><p id="Par97">Our findings showed that HCPs factors greatly influence the delivery of PCC to women with diabetes. Major barriers include limited knowledge and expertise in PCC, non-holistic clinical approaches, and poor teamwork and collaboration. While gaining PCC-related knowledge is often seen as an individual responsibility, participants in this study as well as those reported in other studies, point to systemic factors like limited training, minimal exposure to women&#8217;s health, and staffing shortages as reasons for these gaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] Evidence also suggests that rapid training alone is inadequate to change clinical practice, highlighting the need for broader improvements in healthcare resources, care flow, and documentation, as well as promotional activities to enhance PCC uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. </p><p id="Par98">In terms of patient-related factors, participants attributed poor engagement with PCC to women&#8217;s lack of familiarity and understanding of pregnancy planning, limited health literacy, sociocultural background, and economic constraint. Personal health literacy refers to the extent to which individuals can locate, comprehend, and utilise information and services to make informed health decisions for themselves and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. An earlier local study found that only 31% of women with diabetes used effective contraception to prevent pregnancy, despite over 65% recognising their risk of pregnancy-related complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Having positive attitudes towards PCC also plays a role, not just health literacy, as evidenced by a study that shows, despite optimal health literacy, the uptake of some components of PCC was low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In addition, some women with diabetes who do not intend to become pregnant often perceive a lower risk of pregnancy and see less need for pregnancy planning, which can cause a delay in actively planning for pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This remains a significant reproductive health issue for women with diabetes that needs to be addressed within the PCC framework.</p><sec id="Sec41"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par99">To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first qualitative studies exploring the challenges and barriers experienced or observed by HCPs when delivering PCC for women with diabetes in public health clinics in Malaysia. Other local studies have evaluated PCC, but in a more general context or studies involving patients. The findings of our study offer more in-depth insights into the delivery of PCC for women with chronic diseases, potentially informing the development of strategies to overcome these barriers. This study also presents perspectives not only from doctors but also from nurses and AMOs, emphasising similar challenges and thereby enhancing the trustworthiness of the data. The generalisability of this study is limited, as the findings reflect only the views and experiences of HCPs in public health clinics, and not those from private clinics or from either government nor private hospital settings. These institutions may differ in patients&#8217; sociocultural and economic background, system infrastructure, and resource accessibility, which may result in varied views and experiences regarding PCC services. Future studies should explore the perspectives of policymakers or key stakeholders in reproductive health to develop a pragmatic approach to improve PCC services in the country.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par100">This study highlights the gaps involving organisations, HCPs, and factors influencing women with diabetes that must be addressed when implementing PCC for these women, especially given the high prevalence of diabetes in the country and its serious complications if not properly managed. Instead of segregating management within similar healthcare facilities, a more effective approach could involve consolidating resources to address manpower, space, and infrastructure challenges. Equally important is providing adequate training for HCPs to enhance care quality and improve health literacy among women with diabetes. Successful implementation relies on effective engagement between HCPs and the women. In this way, PCC can be recognised as a vital component of the healthcare system for diabetes management in the country. Additionally, this approach can be adapted for women with other chronic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
