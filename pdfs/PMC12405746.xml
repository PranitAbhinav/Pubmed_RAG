Patients display hypersensitivities to a spectrum of stimuli. Patients&#8217; blunt pressure pain thresholds are typically reduced, and sometimes (&#8764;15%) gentle brushstroke induces allodynia. However, aftersensations after these stimuli have not, to our knowledge, been reported.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We examined the perception of blunt pressure and &#8220;pleasant touch&#8221; in FMS. Patients were first interviewed and completed standard psychometric questionnaires. We then measured their sensitivity to blunt pressure and perception of pleasant touch, including aftersensations; patients were followed up for 5&#160;days to evaluate lingering pain from blunt pressure.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>We recruited 51 patients with FMS and 16 pain-free healthy controls (HCs) at a UK Pain Management Centre. Forty-four patients completed the aftersensation protocol. Most patients reported pain after the application of less mechanical pressure than the level of pressure at which HCs reported pain; median arm and leg thresholds for the patients with FMS were 167&#8201;kPa and 233&#8201;kPa, respectively. Eighty-four percent (31/37) of patients reported ongoing pain at the site of pressure application 1&#160;day after testing, and 49% (18/37) still perceived pain at 5&#160;days. Aftersensations after brushstroke were common in the FMS group, reported by 77% (34/44) of patients with FMS vs 25% (4/16) of HCs; 34% (15/44) of patients, but no HCs, perceived these aftersensations as uncomfortable. For patients with FMS who experienced aftersensations, brushstroke pleasantness ratings were reduced, and the skin was often an important site of pain.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Pain after blunt pressure assessment typically lingers for several days. Aftersensations after brushstroke stimulation are a previously unreported FMS phenomenon. They are associated with tactile anhedonia and might identify a clinically distinct subgroup.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Fibromyalgia</kwd><kwd>Chronic Pain</kwd><kwd>Painful Aftersensations</kwd><kwd>PAS</kwd><kwd>Quantitative Sensory Testing</kwd><kwd>QST</kwd><kwd>Lingering Pain</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Council</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">10.13039/501100000265</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/S003428/1</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pain Relief Foundation</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">10.13039/501100000323</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic widespread pain condition of uncertain etiology.<xref rid="pnaf080-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> FMS pain, associated tenderness<xref rid="pnaf080-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>, and fatigue often have a devastating impact on patients&#8217; function, activity, and quality of life.<xref rid="pnaf080-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="pnaf080-B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> FMS has been classically viewed as a pain state with central amplification.<xref rid="pnaf080-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="pnaf080-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="pnaf080-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> However, there is also mounting evidence of peripheral abnormalities, including small-fiber pathology with abnormal nociceptor function<xref rid="pnaf080-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5&#8211;9</sup></xref> and abnormal thermoregulatory peripheral innervations.<xref rid="pnaf080-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p><p>In patients with FMS, quantitative sensory testing (QST)<xref rid="pnaf080-B11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="pnaf080-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> demonstrates marked hypersensitivity to a broad spectrum of standardized stimuli; such hypersensitivity is established by registering the patient&#8217;s evaluation of the stimulus while it is applied.<xref rid="pnaf080-B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="pnaf080-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Patients&#8217; blunt pressure pain thresholds are typically reduced, which is termed <italic toggle="yes">static mechanical allodynia</italic><xref rid="pnaf080-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>, but gentle brushstroke alone can induce pain<italic toggle="yes">,</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">dynamic mechanical allodynia</italic>, in 10&#8211;20%.<xref rid="pnaf080-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> In relation to noxious thermal stimuli (i.e.<italic toggle="yes">,</italic> stimuli that would be painful in normal skin), patients with FMS, similar to patients with other chronic pain conditions, can report painful aftersensations (PAS), i.e., sensations that persist even though application of the stimulus has ceased.<xref rid="pnaf080-B17" ref-type="bibr">17&#8211;19</xref>.

To our knowledge, no quantitative or qualitative data on aftersensations after brushstroke stimuli have been published. Our goals in the present study were to describe, in patients with persistent FMS, aftersensations arising from aspects of mechanical QST assessment and from clinical examination as per ACR 1990, as well as to characterize subgroups formed on the basis of these phenomena. Here, we report on aftersensations after application of both blunt mechanical pressure and brushstroke in a cohort of patients with FMS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design and Study Subjects</title><p>Patients participated in an ongoing phenotyping study aiming to correlate clinical with immunological phenotypes (ISRCTN: 18414398). They had been identified from a registry of patients assessed for treatment with an interdisciplinary pain management program (PMP) at a tertiary National Health Service hospital in northern England (The Walton Centre). All patients had consented for their names to be entered into this registry; the consenting rate for entry is 98%.</p><p>Patients were approached for the phenotyping study by letter, and interested patients attended a single study visit. Inclusion criteria were FMS of more than 1&#160;year&#8217;s duration, ACR diagnosis 2010<xref rid="pnaf080-B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> or 1990<xref rid="pnaf080-B26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> (both were assessed on the day, and either qualified), age greater than 18&#8201;years, and an average weekly pain intensity of &#8805;4/10 on a numerical rating scale (NRS) (where 0&#160;= &#8220;no pain&#8221; and 10&#160;= &#8220;pain as bad as you can imagine&#8221;). The examination for tender points as per ACR 1990<xref rid="pnaf080-B26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> was conducted after some training had occurred to achieve a pressure of approximately 4&#8201;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or breastfeeding and inadequate understanding of the English language.</p><p>With regard to aftersensations, drawing from clinical experience, we expected that patients would find both the clinical examination of tender points<xref rid="pnaf080-B26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and examination with the pressure algometer (see below) painful for a prolonged period after the assessment, and we wished to study the duration of that response. Patients were given a pain diary to enter the presence or absence of any lingering pain from the examination of ACR 1990 tender points<xref rid="pnaf080-B26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and algometry test sites on each of days 1 to 5 after their study visit, and these scores were communicated over the telephone after this period.</p><p>Upon examination with brushstroke, as part of a protocol to assess pleasant touch, initial patients in this phenotyping study unexpectedly reported post-examination aftersensations, which often seemed unpleasant. These initial research subjects further advised that it was challenging for them to clearly identify aftersensations as &#8220;painful&#8221; and that the term &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; would best encompass the unpleasant sensation that they experienced. We consequently adapted the study protocol to allow a more in-depth assessment of this phenomenon. We obtained ethics approval to inquire about the character of these sensations and to include a pain-free healthy control (HC) comparator group, which was subsequently recruited from university and health care staff.</p><p>The phenotyping study received ethics approval from Health and Care Research Board Wales: 18/WA/0234.

This was interrogated through a mixed-methods approach.<xref rid="pnaf080-B36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Subjects were asked to sit comfortably with their left arm supinated on a pillow. Participants were shown the numerical scales before brushstroke examination and told that they would be stroked with a soft brush. A 30-cm ruler was placed securely alongside their arm. The ruler placement marked the test site and was consistent for all tests. Participants received gentle stroking touch applied manually to the skin of the lateral left forearm in the supinated position at slow (3&#8201;cm/s) and fast (30&#8201;cm/s) speeds from proximal to distal (with the hair growth) over a 10-cm length. A QST brush (SENSELab Brush-05, Somedic SenseLab AB, Norra Mellby, Sweden) was used to deliver the stimulus and a metronome used to ensure correct speeds. The brushstroke was not obscured from the participants. Immediately after each brushstroke, subjects were asked to rate their perceptions on a grounded 5-cm NRS for pleasantness, intensity, ticklishness, and pain. The anchoring statements are shown in parentheses and were as follows: Pleasantness was rated from &#8211;5 (&#8220;very unpleasant&#8221;) to +5 (&#8220;very pleasant&#8221;). Participants were then asked to rate the intensity on a grounded NRS of 0 (&#8220;no sensation&#8221;) to 10 (&#8220;very intense&#8221;).

Normality of data were tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

For non-normally distributed data, a Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank-sum test was used for paired data, and a Mann-Whitney test was used for unpaired data. For comparison of multiple non-normally distributed groups, a Kruskal-Wallis test was implemented. For categorical binary data, a Fisher&#8217;s exact test was used. For the non-normally distributed brushstroke tests and pressure pain threshold data, a Kruskal-Wallis test was used, with a Dunn&#8217;s post hoc test between groups with correction for multiple comparisons. A multiple linear regression model using a least-squares approach was used to analyze variability in brushstroke pleasantness, modeling for intercept and main effects only, and residual plots were assessed for assumption validity.

We found that painful aftersensations (lingering pains) are frequently reported several days after study examination, which included application of blunt pressure during the ACR tender point examination (approximately 4&#8201;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>), pressure pain threshold testing, and brushstroke QST. Eighty percent (25/31) of patients had lingering pain on day 1 and 47% (14/30) on day 5 after examination. The existence of this phenomenon after blunt mechanical stimuli has previously been highlighted by others<xref rid="pnaf080-B20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> and has often been communicated by patients in our own clinical practice; however, to our knowledge, our data provide a first account of its prevalence and duration. The pressure required to generate a noxious stimulus in HCs is typically 200&#8211;300&#160;kPa for the arm and 250&#8211;450&#160;kPa for the leg.<xref rid="pnaf080-B37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> FMS pressure measurements observed in the present study are lower than these, representing mechanical hyperalgesia.</p><p>This finding also confirms that tender point examination in FMS can regularly cause long-lasting discomfort. A count of painful tender points was part of the now superseded ACR 1990 diagnostic criteria.<xref rid="pnaf080-B26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Although the current diagnostic criteria (ACR 2016)<xref rid="pnaf080-B38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> do not include a count of painful tender points, the 1990 criteria are still in wide use, and our results could support diagnosticians in choosing a different appropriate set of diagnostic criteria. These data also support clinical advice to minimize repeat examination in patients with FMS in all settings<xref rid="pnaf080-B39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref>, as well as our recommendation that patients should be given the opportunity to consent to examination after having been informed that they might expect increased pain from the examination.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report of evoked paresthesia or aftersensations after skin-brushstroke testing in FMS. We found that such sensations are common compared with HCs and that patients, but not HCs, often perceive them as uncomfortable. Consistent with the literature, allodynia, defined as pain <italic toggle="yes">during</italic> brushstroke application, was reported by some of our patients (7/51).<xref rid="pnaf080-B37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> This phenomenon in health, however, is not expected to continue after stimulus withdrawal.</p><p>Within the FMS group<italic toggle="yes">,</italic> reports of uncomfortable aftersensations, as opposed to non-uncomfortable or no aftersensations, after brushstroke were associated with reports of reduced pleasantness during brushstroke; on average, slow and fast brushstrokes were, in fact, perceived as unpleasant by this group. Experience of uncomfortable brushstroke aftersensations was not associated with blunt pressure sensitivity, however (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Table S1</xref>), and it was particularly frequent in those patients who noted that their skin was the location of their worst pain (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Figure S1</xref>). These features could, therefore, characterize a distinct FMS clinical subgroup in whom touch processing is differentially affected.</p><p>Reduced brushstroke pleasantness (i.e.<italic toggle="yes">,</italic> during the brushstroke; termed <italic toggle="yes">anhedonia</italic>), as detected in our study, is consistent with recent reports by Boehme et al.<xref rid="pnaf080-B35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> and others, although its cause is still unclear.<xref rid="pnaf080-B40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="pnaf080-B41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> By mapping cortical activity during brushstroking with functional magnetic resonance imaging, Boehme et al. found an inverted pattern of insula activity compared with HCs and inferred, therefore, that FMS anhedonia might be related to aberrant central nervous system evaluative processing.<xref rid="pnaf080-B35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Nonetheless, the finding of anhedonia in FMS does not exclude the possibility of abnormal signal processing of input from sensory afferents. Certainly, evidence of small-fiber pathology in FMS is mounting<xref rid="pnaf080-B42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="pnaf080-B43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref>, with reports of reduced epidermal nerve fiber density<xref rid="pnaf080-B41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> and reduced vascular innervation.<xref rid="pnaf080-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Bosma et al. showed that painful aftersensations after thermal stimuli are associated with increased activation in the cervical cord dorsal horn in patients with FMS<xref rid="pnaf080-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>, pointing perhaps to continued afferent activity.</p><p>We expected to see an inverse correlation of brushstroke pleasantness in our FMS cohort with the PainDETECT score, the lack of this, therefore, may argue against small-fiber pathology as one mechanism of anhedonia in FMS. However, should this be true, and brushstroke testing does predict small-fiber pathology, then using brushstroke testing to diagnose small-fiber pathology would be much preferable to a painful skin biopsy.<xref rid="pnaf080-B42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> In summary, anhedonia could be a consequence of abnormal afferent input, altered spinal processing, or altered brain processing.</p><p>It is tempting to speculate that at least the &#8220;early&#8221; (i.e., &#8764;15&#8201;seconds<xref rid="pnaf080-B20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref>) brushstroke aftersensations might be mediated by slowly conducting C fibers. One such candidate is the CT fiber, a low-threshold afferent that discharges maximally with a slow (1&#8211;10&#8201;cm/s) brushstroke and elicits a pleasant sensation in subjects.<xref rid="pnaf080-B44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> These CT fibers, which are suited to respond to a &#8220;gentle caress,&#8221; are thought to provide the &#8220;neurobiological substrate for the affective and rewarding&#8221; aspects of touch.<xref rid="pnaf080-B45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> This &#8220;social&#8221; touch is clearly important for physical and social well-being<xref rid="pnaf080-B45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref>, and its loss, tactile anhedonia, is a clear feature of FMS.<xref rid="pnaf080-B35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Because CT fibers fire preferentially after stimuli with brushstroke speeds of 1&#8211;10&#8201;cm/s, one might expect aftersensations to be more strongly associated with slow rather than fast brushstroke pleasantness. However, we note that this would suppose that CT firing is normal in FMS&#8212;an assumption that has yet to be confirmed. CT afferent firing in health has a propensity to exhibit afterdischarges upon cessation of an innocuous tactile stimulus<xref rid="pnaf080-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>, which further points to a potential role in the development of aftersensations. A further way to investigate this would be a comparison between brushstrokes and vibro-tactile stimuli, the latter of which strongly activate A-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptor afferents but only weakly excite CT afferents.<xref rid="pnaf080-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="pnaf080-B45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> However, it is important to note that brushstroking will activate A-beta and A-delta fibers, as well as the CT afferents, which could all integrate centrally. There are, of course, other explanations, such as reverberating circuits in the central nervous system or the aforementioned afterdischarging afferents.</p><p>Intriguingly, patients who had attended our PMP treatment had reduced slow brushstroke intensity ratings. Brushstroke pleasantness ratings were not altered, however. These data might provide the first evidence of PMP treatment potentially affecting selected sensory characteristics in FMS. However, given that all patients in this study had been assessed for the suitability of PMP treatment, it is alternatively possible that the entrance criteria for our PMP also selected for patients with a distinct sensory phenotype. A prospective study in PMP participants would shed more light on these issues.</p><p>Dynamic mechanical allodynia and dysesthesias are noted in several neuropathic pain conditions (e.g., post-herpetic neuralgia pain)<xref rid="pnaf080-B46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref>, as well as in fibromyalgia.<xref rid="pnaf080-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> We note that dynamic mechanical allodynia was also present in our study at a 10% incidence. The cohort of patients with aftersensations also had a higher incidence of dynamic mechanical allodynia.</p><p>The PainDETECT questionnaire was validated as a tool to predict the relative contribution of neuropathic pain in neuropathic and nociceptive (e.g., osteoarthritis) conditions. Patients with fibromyalgia were excluded from the validation process, although PainDETECT has been increasingly used in this population. It has been proposed that fibromyalgia should not be considered a neuropathic pain state<xref rid="pnaf080-B47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref>; however, with mounting evidence that FMS has a peripheral component<xref rid="pnaf080-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5&#8211;9</sup></xref>, it is perhaps unsurprising that patients with fibromyalgia experience similar sensory phenomena as patients suffering from neuropathic conditions.<xref rid="pnaf080-B47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> In this study, it is curious that tactile anhedonia was not associated with the PainDETECT score, fibromyalgia severity (FIQR), measures of &#8220;widespreadedness&#8221; (Widespread Pain Index, Symptom Severity Score), or cognitive qualities, such as pain catastrophizing. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, be this neuropathy or something else, it seems plausible that tactile anhedonia points to a distinct phenotype.</p><p>The German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS)<xref rid="pnaf080-B11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> has generated a robust and reproducible QST protocol for assessing patients with neuropathic pain. Though a thorough, useful, and widely accepted approach, the experimental protocol does not account for the assessment of sensations that linger after stimulus withdrawal. We suggest, therefore, that the DFNS protocol might have been failing to capture a common and germane clinical sequela of chronic pain.</p><p>Our present study is limited, as it was not designed to interrogate aftersensations in detail, which were a surprise finding. We did not record their duration or examine whether their qualities were the same for both slow and fast brushstrokes. It should be noted that we did record a significant reduction in pleasantness between slow and fast brushstrokes in HCs and not in patients with FMS, which has been previously noted and underpins the C-fiber tactile theory, although it failed to meet significance in our study in all analyses. The control group was small and was restricted to females, and it did not, therefore, match the FMS group in this regard. Although the proportion of male patients with FMS included was small (n&#8201;=&#8201;3), it is conceivable that aftersensations had some gender bias: In our FMS cohort, all males for whom we have data had aftersensations. The HC group also differed by age, body mass index, and weight, which were potential confounders.</p><p>It is important to note that in the present study we measured both brushstroke QST and pressure algometry, and we performed tender point examination. It is not possible, therefore, to extract the relevant contributions of each of these in relation to persisting aftersensations (lingering pain). We further note that the pressure algometry, unlike the tender point examination, stopped exactly at the point of painfulness and involved two points on the body (the tender point examination involved 18 points). Therefore, we assume that the tender point examination was responsible for most of the lingering pain; however, this study was not designed to confirm this.</p><p>We did not record data on the presence or absence of aftersensations in the HC group after pressure pain threshold detection, and this is a clear limitation. HCs have been reported to experience painful aftersensations after blunt pressure mechanical stimulus, though the frequency was low at 12% and of an unknown duration.<xref rid="pnaf080-B25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Patients with FMS are probably heterogenous in sensory phenotypes<xref rid="pnaf080-B48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref>, and it is true that such variability would hamper our ability to distinguish between groups. As this was an exploratory study, we were not powered to tease out subtle relationships between aftersensations and psychometric data. A larger study is warranted for this. Our cohort was obtained from a tertiary referral center and might not, therefore, have been fully representative of all patients in the community. With these pilot data, it would now be possible to adequately power a study to test the hypothesis that the uncomfortable aftersensation group is more sensitive (as suggested by the association with reduced brushstroke pleasantness), possibly with respect to social measures, such as assessed by the Touch Experiences and Attitudes Questionnaire.<xref rid="pnaf080-B49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> In addition to these measures, biochemical changes might also be investigated&#8212;for example, cortisone or endorphin levels locally or systemically. We placed emphasis on the bothersomeness of patient symptomatology, and, in this regard, further work might look to investigate the presence and character of itch and how this is related to ticklishness. Examinations for atypical allodynia and paresthesia can easily be done in the clinical setting, and understanding patient phenotypes in terms of these could be clinically useful.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we report, for the first time, the presence of aftersensations after the cessation of an innocuous light touch stimulus in a cohort of patients with fibromyalgia. When present, these aftersensations are often uncomfortable. We also report on the prevalence of lingering pain after pressure examination. We suggest that these findings have key implications for clinicians examining patients and ramifications for experimental trajectories. The recognition of these aftersensations could reassure patients and inform the advice and education given to them. Further research is, of course, needed to investigate these phenomena in FMS and other chronic pains. In this regard, we note that medical efficacy is contingent on placing patients at the center of diagnostic formulations and the interrogation of etiologies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>
