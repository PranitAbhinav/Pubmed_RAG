Traditional methods for managing VTR frequently face limitations due to differences among individuals, highlighting the necessity for tailored approaches that incorporate personalised risk evaluations, cutting-edge monitoring techniques and enhanced treatment options. Despite the substantial potential of this emerging idea to tackle such an important clinical issue, there is a notable absence of a comprehensive review of the current evidence available.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>This protocol for a scoping review outlines a methodical strategy to chart the existing research landscape related to precision management of VTR in the context of caesarean delivery performed under neuraxial anaesthesia. By developing a conceptual framework, assessing the combined benefits of cutting-edge technologies and summarising tailored intervention techniques, this review aims to pinpoint key attributes, critical areas and new research directions, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of clinical practices and the formulation of rigorous future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This research will thoroughly follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. The eligibility criteria will be outlined using the population, concept, context framework. A comprehensive search across various international and Chinese databases (such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang and VIP) will be performed for literature published until March 2025, with a final update conducted before submission. Two reviewers will independently assess the literature and extract data. The data will be synthesised in a narrative format, supplemented by tabular and graphical representations, including conceptual framework diagrams and technology application matrices.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>As this is a secondary analysis of published literature, ethics approval is not required. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at international conferences, establishing an evidence foundation for clinical pathways and guiding future research initiatives.

VTR is not merely a single symptom but rather a complex syndrome that includes nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, palpitations, difficulty breathing, restlessness and even severe dull visceral pain.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> These responses can significantly undermine maternal comfort and the quality of care provided. Additionally, they might lead to or worsen intraoperative haemodynamic instability (such as hypotension and bradycardia), extend recovery time after surgery and increase the likelihood of chronic postsurgical pain<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and postpartum depression.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4 6</sup></xref></p><p>Recent meta-analyses show that the overall incidence of VTR during caesarean deliveries performed under neuraxial anaesthesia may reach as high as 36.0%,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7 8</sup></xref> with potentially increased rates in high-risk groups. This figure highlights the widespread nature of VTR and its significant threat to maternal health. Current approaches for preventing and treating VTR&#8212;including the empirical use of antiemetics, optimising dosages of neuraxial local anaesthetics or adjuvants (such as dexmedetomidine<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>), and employing non-pharmacological methods (like P6 acupressure<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>)&#8212;provide some degree of relief. Nevertheless, the clinical effectiveness of these strategies often varies, due to differences among individuals. This &#8216;one-size-fits-all&#8217; or symptomatic treatment approach does not adequately consider the inherent variability in physiological traits, psychological conditions, underlying health issues and treatment responses among parturients, thereby hindering optimal and personalised VTR management. The constraints present in existing management frameworks highlight the pressing clinical need for a shift towards more proactive, tailored and systematic precision management strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Precision management of VTR: concept, core elements and research necessity</title><p>The intricate pathophysiology of VTR incorporates various components, such as mechanical stimulation from visceral traction,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> the engagement of vagal and sympathetic afferent pathways,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> the release of a variety of neurotransmitters (including serotonin, dopamine and substance P), as well as inflammatory mediators and the sensitisation of the central nervous system.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> This multifaceted aetiology, which operates through multiple pathways, underscores the inherent limitations of interventions that rely on a single modality and provides a strong theoretical foundation for the implementation of &#8216;precision management&#8217;.</p><p>This research defines &#8216;Precision Management of VTR&#8217; as a comprehensive, dynamic, and patient-focused approach that integrates both prevention and treatment strategies. The core principle is to go beyond conventional treatment models that consider population averages, shifting instead towards tailored decision-making based on the distinct characteristics of each patient, ultimately aiming to provide the most effective intervention at the right time for the right individual. In particular, precision management of VTR consists of three interrelated fundamental components.</p><sec id="s1-2-1"><title>Individualised risk assessment and stratification</title><p>This involves an extensive assessment of various maternal data dimensions&#8212;such as demographic factors (eg, age, body mass index), physiological metrics (eg, resting heart rate, blood pressure, status of the autonomic nervous system), psychological elements (eg, anxiety levels before surgery, pain catastrophising), medical background (eg, past experiences with motion sickness, history of VTR, abdominal surgeries) and possibly genetic tendencies. The aim is to create and validate strong predictive models for risk that can effectively identify individuals who are at an increased risk of experiencing VTR, thus guiding future intervention strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2-2"><title>Integration of innovative monitoring technologies</title><p>This component goes beyond traditional monitoring of vital signs by integrating innovative technologies that provide enhanced insights into physiological conditions. Examples illustrating this advancement include the real-time analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) to evaluate the functionality of the autonomic nervous system and the balance between sympathetic and vagal influences.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Additionally, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) algorithms allows for the integration of diverse perioperative data sources&#8212;such as vital signs, electroencephalogram readings, anaesthetic dosages and surgical activities&#8212;to enable dynamic predictions or early alerts regarding the risk of VTR. Furthermore, research into wearable devices facilitates ongoing, non-invasive monitoring of physiological parameters, while the use of non-invasive biomarkers like salivary &#945;-amylase<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> or cortisol assists in evaluating patient stress levels and susceptibility to VTR.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2-3"><title>Optimised intervention portfolio based on risk and monitoring feedback</title><p>This process includes the flexible modification and choice of the most suitable combinations of multimodal interventions, based on tailored risk stratification results and immediate physiological data obtained from cutting-edge monitoring technologies. It not only involves the careful use of pharmacological treatments (eg, choosing specific drugs for different risk profiles, fine-tuning dosages, timing and methods of administration) but also the customised application of non-pharmacological strategies (eg, adjusting acupressure techniques, creating responsive music therapy, employing focused cognitive-behavioural methods), as well as the thorough investigation of potential synergistic benefits among various interventions.</p><p>Advanced technologies like HRV analysis and AI algorithms have shown significant promise in enhancing diagnostic and treatment accuracy across various medical fields, such as predicting cardiovascular disease risk, detecting early signs of sepsis and managing pain. Nevertheless, there is a notable absence of systematic evidence synthesis and thorough &#8216;evidence mapping&#8217; regarding their integrated application methods, distinctive clinical benefits (eg, their ability to markedly improve the accuracy of VTR prediction or to facilitate timely adjustments in intervention strategies to avert or alleviate VTR), clinical practicality, cost-effectiveness and ways to efficiently integrate these into current clinical workflows specifically aimed at VTR precision management. Considering the multifaceted and integrative aspects of VTR precision management, this research employs an &#8216;evidence mapping&#8217; approach. This methodology aims to systematically identify, categorise and visually depict the distribution, features and volume of existing evidence across different combinations of risk factors, monitoring tools and intervention strategies. Such mapping will more clearly highlight research hotspots, areas with limited evidence and the current landscape of collaborative research among these essential components.</p><p>Current evaluations related to VTR mainly concentrate on assessing individual or specific types of interventions, or they are limited to traditional management strategies. As a result, they do not thoroughly and forward-looking examine the developing and potentially groundbreaking holistic idea of &#8216;precision management of VTR&#8217;. The unique contribution of this scoping review lies in its ability to:</p><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>Systematically chart the entire landscape of research concerning VTR precision management for the first time, outlining its fundamental components, theoretical foundations and practical developments.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Critically evaluate the opportunities and obstacles related to the incorporation of cutting-edge technologies in the VTR field, and examine feasible routes for their adoption in clinical settings.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Strive to establish an extensive framework for VTR precision management, ranging from theoretical abstraction to clinical implementation, through the synthesis of existing evidence.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Offer clear, strategic guidance for creating evidence-based clinical pathways and future research initiatives, especially pertaining to validation trials and studies focused on implementation.</p></list-item></list><p>This research, using an &#8216;evidence mapping&#8217; approach, seeks to distinctly illustrate the scope, depth and attributes of knowledge in this discipline, while also pinpointing areas that remain underexplored, rather than evaluating the effectiveness of any particular intervention.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research aims and key questions</title><p>The primary objective of this scoping review is to thoroughly outline the global research framework concerning precision management for VTR during caesarean delivery conducted under neuraxial anaesthesia. This will be achieved by methodically identifying, assessing and mapping the current body of literature. The review aims to clarify essential concepts, theoretical frameworks, critical technologies, intervention strategies, significant research outcomes and key focus areas for future exploration.

How do these integrated applications offer unique clinical benefits when compared with conventional monitoring techniques or clinical assessments? What are the practical feasibility and limitations of these methods in real-world clinical environments?

Additionally, what is the present state of research concerning multimodal interventions (which integrate both pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods) in the precision management of VTR, particularly regarding their combined effects and optimised strategies? What evidence supports the efficacy and safety of these precision intervention approaches?

By establishing a robust knowledge framework, identifying the synergistic value of innovative technologies, synthesising refined intervention strategies and clarifying future research directions, this scoping review aims to provide a strong scientific foundation for the transformation of VTR management. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the transition from traditional, experience-based approaches to individualised precision medicine in obstetric anaesthesia. This paradigm shift has the potential to significantly improve perioperative experiences and health outcomes for mothers undergoing caesarean delivery, thereby realising the profound significance and potential of precision medicine principles in this critical field. Through systematic evidence mapping and comprehensive synthesis, this review will not only advance academic understanding but also provide practical guidance for clinical implementation, ultimately contributing to enhanced maternal care quality and satisfaction in caesarean deliveries worldwide.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Study limitations</title><sec id="s6-1"><title>Methodological constraints of scoping reviews</title><p>Unlike systematic reviews, this study maps the evidence landscape rather than evaluating intervention effectiveness.
