This study aimed to assess the extent of alarm fatigue among ICU nurses at a German university hospital using the Charit&#233; Alarm Fatigue Questionnaire (CAFQa) and to examine differences based on working hours and professional experience.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">An observational cross-sectional study design was used. Data were collected via an online survey from nurses working in five intensive care units (ICUs) of a German university hospital between January and March 2024. The questionnaire comprised 27 items based on the Charit&#233; Alarm Fatigue Questionnaire (CAFQa). Additionally, participants rated their perceived alarm fatigue on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 100%. Above that, participants were asked to provide information regarding their ICU experience and monthly workdays. Statistical significance was assessed using two-sample t-tests. Correlations between CAFQa scores and self-reported alarm fatigue were analysed using Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient. A p-value of &lt;&#8201;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A total of 70 ICU nurses participated in the study. No significant differences in alarm fatigue were found between nurses working more than eight days per month and those working fewer days (t(56)&#8201;=&#8201;1.00, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.32), and with more than one year of ICU experience and less experience, respectively (t(56)&#8201;=&#8201;1.32, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.19). Complete CAFQa data were available for 59 participants. The mean CAFQa score was (17.7&#8201;&#177;&#8201;5.5) points out of 36 points ((49&#8201;&#177;&#8201;15) %), indicating moderate to high alarm fatigue. Individual scores ranged from 5 (14%) to 28 (78%). The average self-reported alarm fatigue was (47&#8201;&#177;&#8201;22) %.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Alarm fatigue is present among ICU nurses in moderate to high levels, but no significant differences were observed based on working hours or professional experience.

Alarm fatigue occurs when health care workers are exposed to an overwhelming number of alarms, which can lead to desensitization or improper use of alarm settings, resulting in reduced patient safety due to an insufficient or delayed response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. ICU staff are unavoidably exposed to a large number of alarms generated by patient monitoring and other medical devices during their daily work. Alarm fatigue has been a concern for over a decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The number of medical devices that generate alarms has increased significantly, and nursing staff may get overwhelmed by the constant exposure and, consequently, experience alarm fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The purpose of alarms is to increase patient safety by shortening the reaction time between the occurrence of a problem, for instance, potentially dangerous changes in vital parameters or failures of equipment, and the required response or intervention by attracting attention through acoustic or visual signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, alarms can also be triggered by artifacts or mismeasurements. Multiple studies over the last decades have shown that most alarms are false or not clinically relevant, indicating that 74 to 99% of all alarms did not require attention or clinical intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A more recent study conducted by Andrade-M&#233;ndez et al. also showed that the clinical relevance of most alarms was medium to low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Since alarm fatigue may adversely impact patients and ICU personnel, assessing the alarm fatigue level is essential to provide safety and investigate effective coping strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Even though alarm fatigue has already been identified as a problem in ICUs years ago, and there have been attempts to develop a measuring tool, a gold standard has not been established yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">We used the Charit&#233; Alarm Fatigue Questionnaire (CAFQa) developed by Wunderlich et al. to assess alarm fatigue in ICU nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To our knowledge, studies evaluating alarm fatigue among ICU nurses in Germany using the CAFQa are limited. This study provides a single-centre application example.</p><p id="Par9">The research question addressed the extent to which alarm fatigue is present among ICU nurses in a German University Hospital and whether working hours and ICU experience have an impact on alarm fatigue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics approval</title><p id="Par10">This analysis is covered by the approval of the ethics committee of the School of Medicine and Health, Technical University of Munich (Ismaninger Stra&#223;e 22, 81675 Munich, Chairperson Prof. Dr. G. Schmidt, Reference 264/21S) as well as the hospital&#8217;s workers council. Participation in this study was entirely voluntary and anonymous. No separate informed consent procedure was necessary. Consent was implied by the return of the questionnaire. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting and sample</title><p id="Par11">The study was conducted between January 2024 and March 2024, after the COVID-19 pandemic. It was a cross-sectional study to assess alarm fatigue in ICU personnel working in the TUM University Hospital Rechts der Isar in Munich, Germany. The ICUs had a surgical, medical, or toxicological focus. Participation was voluntary and there was no incentive or payment for participation. The inclusion criteria were the participants&#8217; consent to participate in the study by return of the questionnaire and their affiliation to a participating ICU. Our research included nurses from five TUM University Hospital Rechts der Isar ICUs via an online survey. The data was collected through the platform LamaPoll [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], which allowed participants to access the survey anonymously through a direct link.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par12">The CAFQa was used to assess the alarm fatigue of ICU nurses. Additionally, 18 items which were used during the development of the CAFQa, regarding alarm frequency, alarm perception, assignments to alarms, handling of alarms and workflow were collected. Each item of the questionnaire is scored on a five-point Likert scale (4 = &#8220;I very much agree&#8221;, 3 = &#8220;I agree&#8221;, 2 = &#8220;I agree in part&#8221;, 1 = &#8220;I do not agree&#8221;, 0 = &#8220;I do not agree at all&#8221;). Additionally, the participants were asked to rate their alarm fatigue on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100%. It was possible to abstain from answering specific questions. Above that, the participants were asked to indicate whether they had &#8220;more than one year&#8221; or &#8220;one year or less&#8221; of professional experience, and whether they worked &#8220;more than eight days&#8221; or &#8220;eight days or less&#8221; per month on average in the ICU. To protect the anonymity of participants, we chose not to collect data on age, gender, and affiliated ICU. In case of a small sample size, which was possible as our study was conducted in a single centre, collecting such information could increase the risk of participant re-identification. We decided to use a web-based survey tool to ensure that transcription errors were ruled out and to enable faster analysis of the responses. Above that, web-based surveys allow participants to complete the questionnaire at a time and location of their choosing, thereby accommodating individual schedules and potentially reducing time pressure or situational stress that could influence their responses. LamaPoll adheres to German data protection regulations and fully supports anonymous surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although the quality of responses in web-based surveys has been questioned in the past, a recent study conducted by Clement et al. does not substantiate that self-administered web-based surveys encourage greater satisficing behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, they found no indications that web-based surveys were more cognitively burdensome or distracting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A potential limitation could be that web-based surveys require a certain amount of technological literacy. Since the study was carried out in a University Hospital, with our ICUs being highly digitised, one can assume that our ICU personnel are comfortable with web-based surveys. The estimated time to complete the questionnaire was approximately eight minutes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>The CAFQa alarm fatigue questionnaire</title><p id="Par13">The CAFQa was developed by Wunderlich et al. in 2023 and is aimed at nurses and physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The questionnaire consists of 9 items covering the psychophysiological effects of alarms and the staff&#8217;s coping strategies in working with alarms. It is scored based on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (&#8220;I do not agree at all&#8221;) to 4 (&#8220;I very much agree&#8221;). Items 6, 7, 8, and 9 have a negative valence and, therefore, are reverse-scored, i.e., 0 (&#8220;I very much agree&#8221;) to 4 (&#8220;I do not agree at all&#8221;). The range of scores in the CAFQa alarm fatigue questionnaire was from 0 (no alarm fatigue at all) to 36 (extreme alarm fatigue). A higher score indicated higher alarm fatigue. The developers suggested converting the score into a percentage to describe the level of alarm fatigue more intuitively.</p><p id="Par14">To date, there is no established gold standard for measuring alarm fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, we decided to use the CAFQa in our study since it fulfilled the following conditions: First, the CAFQa is transparent about its validated language, which in this case is German [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The alarm fatigue questionnaire developed by Torabizadeh et al. did not specify its original language or the translation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To avoid low-quality translations or second-level translations of non-validated first-level translations, which may result in a flawed interpretation, we chose to use the CAFQa. Above that, the development of the CAFQa adhered to the best practices of scale construction, which is not the case for other frequently used alarm fatigue questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Alarm fatigue is a phenomenon that not only affects nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although we did not include physicians in our analysis, the CAFQa targets them as well, and we believe that a standardized measuring tool should all medical professions in the ICU. Two independent studies have substantiated the construct validity of the CAFQa alarm fatigue questionnaire. It is a reliable instrument for measuring alarm fatigue in nurses and physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par15">The collected data was analysed using Microsoft Excel and OriginPro, Version 2023 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Qualitative variables, like ICU experience (&#8220;one year or less&#8221; or &#8220;more than one year&#8221;) and monthly workdays (&#8220;8 days or less&#8221; or &#8220;more than 8 days&#8221;), are expressed as percentages and frequencies. Quantitative variables are presented as mean values and standard deviations. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used for confirmation of the normal distribution of the data. A two-sample t-test was used to assess statistical significance. The correlation between the participants&#8217; CAFQa score and their self-evaluation of alarm fatigue was analysed using Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient. The threshold for statistical significance was set at <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05. The internal consistency of each subscale was assessed using Cronbach&#8217;s &#945;.

After the study, meetings with the ICU department heads were scheduled to discuss the results and possible solutions. During these discussions, the rather critical findings regarding practice guidelines and onboarding processes were also addressed, as participants indicated that they often receive little guidance in their daily routine on how to handle alarms. The manufacturers of several medical devices were contacted to eventually adjust the default factory settings, which had been modified to better fit clinical requirements. Furthermore, alarm fatigue has been added to the Advanced Training in Intensive Care curriculum to raise awareness and provide education. Several training courses regarding alarm management and alarm fatigue, such as &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">One Minute Wonders</italic>&#8221; and structured group training, have been offered. In small groups, participants brainstormed and discussed possible solutions to minimise alarm fatigue on their respective wards. Additionally, meetings were held with the practical nursing instructors to explore how these topics can be integrated into the onboarding and ongoing training of nursing. We intend to administer the CAFQa again in order to facilitate a longitudinal analysis and assess possible changes regarding the nurses&#8217; alarm fatigue over time, expanding the survey to include physicians and other healthcare professionals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par52">This study has several limitations. It was a cross-sectional study with a relatively small sample size. All participants are affiliated with the same university hospital. Most participants have a similar amount of ICU experience and workdays per month. Due to the limited sample size and lack of variability in terms of working hours and experience, meaningful subgroup analyses &#8211; such as comparisons between different levels of experience and/or qualification, workloads, employment relationship (TUM University employee or temporary employee) or intensive care units (e.g. surgical vs. medical) &#8211; were not possible. Furthermore, we deliberately chose not to collect data on age, gender, highest level of education attained and specific ICU qualifications in order to protect the anonymity of participants. However, this also limits the ability to analyse possible relationships with demographic factors. The second subscale showed lower internal consistency, which is in line with the original validation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This suggests that the lower reliability is a known property of this subscale. Although the questionnaire was designed to be completed within approximately eight minutes, it is possible that some participants perceived it as too lengthy. Future studies might consider distributing a shorter version to further reduce the risk of survey fatigue and improve completion rates. Lastly, participation in this study was voluntary. Thus, it is likely that the participants are primarily staff members interested in or affected by the study topic. This may lead to bias. Larger longitudinal studies involving a more diverse study sample with different levels of professional expertise are needed. Generalization may be made with caution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par53">Based on our findings, ICU nurses experience moderate to high levels of alarm fatigue with a significant correlation between self-assessment and CAFQa scores. While no significant differences were found regarding experience or workload, the perception of insufficient procedural instructions underscores the need for structured alarm management training. Given the potential negative impact on both health care workers and patients, it is crucial to recognise and implement effective strategies to minimise alarm fatigue. This study&#8217;s results will serve as the basis for improving our local processes and work environment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the teams in our intensive care units, who contributed substantially to the success of this manuscript and the coverage of the topic of &#8220;alarm fatigue&#8221; through their participation and valuable input.
