Here, we report a reconfigurable piezo-ionotropic polymer membrane engineered for biomimetic sustainable multi-resonance acoustic sensing, offering exceptional sensitivity (530&#8201;kPa<sup>-1</sup>) and broadband frequency discrimination (20&#8201;Hz to 3300&#8201;Hz) while remaining resistant to &#8220;dying&#8221;. The acoustic sensing capability is driven by an ion hitching-in cage effect intrinsic to the ion gel combined with fluorinated polyurethane. In this platform, the engineered ionotropic polymer stretches under acoustic vibrations, allowing cations to penetrate the widened hard segments and engage in strong ion-dipole interactions (cation&#183;&#183;&#183;F), thereby restricting ion flux and amplifying impedance changes. Additionally, the sensor&#8217;s sustainability is ensured through its self-healing properties and hydrophobic components, which enable effective self-repair in both conventional and aqueous environments without ion leakage, achieving a room-temperature healing speed of 0.3&#8211;0.4 &#956;m/min.

However, prolonged overstimulation and exposure to physical hazards can lead to damage to sensory receptors. To protect the uniform distribution and function of these receptors from damage, sensory tissues directly exposed to the environment, including the epidermis, olfactory epithelium and gustatory cells, undergo continuous regeneration after injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In contrast, hair cells and the basilar membranes in the auditory system exhibit an extremely limited regenerative capacity in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, the intricate structure of hair cells makes them particularly susceptible to damage from aging or disease, leading to irreversible sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), the most prevalent form of sensory impairment in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Currently, cochlear implants are the primary therapeutic option for SNHL. However, these devices require invasive surgical procedures that substitute the natural auditory system, posing significant risks, including tissue necrosis, facial paralysis and meningitis, as well as significant financial burdens for patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Addressing the underlying cause of SNHL could revolutionize treatment strategies. Since SNHL primarily results from damage to hair cells on the basilar membrane while other auditory tissues remain intact, the development of an artificial basilar membrane could substantially reduce the scope and complexity of necessary surgical interventions.</p><p id="Par5">To meet the requirements for constructing an artificial basilar membrane, multi-resonant acoustic sensors have been developed by mimicking the biological auditory system based on piezoelectric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, triboelectric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, capacitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and resistive materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, achieving the required sensitivity. Despite these advances, a significant challenge remains due to the use of rigid materials in these sensors, which are prone to cracking under prolonged acoustic vibrations and could potentially cause SNHL anew. Additionally, the mechanical mismatch between the rigid electronic components and the soft biological tissues frequently leads to tissue damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. More importantly, conventional electronic conduction-driven sensors, unlike the ionic conduction in biological systems, can induce redox reactions that result in corrosion and gas evolution when exposed to wet environments (e.g., biofluid) during operation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. To address these mechanical and electrochemical mismatches, an ideal design for an artificial basilar membrane would use entirely soft materials that mimic the ionotropic mechanotransduction mechanisms observed in biological sensory systems. Furthermore, considering the non-regenerative properties of hair cells and the high water content (98&#8211;99%) of the lymph fluid in the inner ear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, it is crucial that the artificial basilar membrane possesses self-healing capability in humid environments, ensuring its durability and functionality for in vivo implantability.</p><p id="Par6">Here, inspired by the ionotropic mechanotransduction mechanism and structural features of the basilar membrane in the human auditory system, we report a reconfigurable piezo-ionotropic polymer membrane engineered for biomimetic, sustainable, multi-resonance acoustic sensing, offering exceptional sensitivity and frequency discrimination while being immune to &#8220;dying&#8221;. To achieve this, hydrophobic fluorine groups were initially incorporated into the polyurethane molecular chain along with units of high electronegativity and dynamic covalent bonds in the hard segments, resulting in underwater self-healing properties. Subsequently, ionic liquid ([BMIM]<sup>+</sup>[TFSI]&#8315;) was employed as an ion donor and combined with self-healable fluorinated polyurethane (SFPU) to develop the self-healing piezo-ionotropic polymer (ShPiP), the key sensing material in the piezo-ionotropic multi-resonance acoustic sensor (PiMAS). PiMAS demonstrates significant advancements in both sensitivity and frequency discrimination. The ion hitching-in cage effect, enabled by the dynamic reconfiguration of polymer networks, efficiently regulates ion flux under acoustic pressure, thereby enhancing PiMAS&#8217;s acoustic sensitivity. Acoustic pressure causes the polymer chains in ShPiP to stretch, creating interstitial passages between hard segments-akin to unlocking a sealed cage. Mobile cations migrate through these interstitial passages and hitch into the transient cage-like openings formed within the polymer network, via reversible ion-dipole interactions with the electronegative fluorine groups in the hard segments, resulting in an increase in impedance. As a result, PiMAS can accurately identify sound frequencies from 20&#8201;Hz&#160;to 3200&#8201;Hz, particularly within the human speech frequency range (men: 64&#8211;523&#8201;Hz; women: 160&#8211;1200&#8201;Hz), demonstrating high sensitivity to both sound pressure and strain. Furthermore, the dynamic and reconfigurable properties of ShPiP enable PiMAS to maintain its waterproof and self-healing capabilities across diverse environments, including air, water, and even lymphatic fluids, offering substantial potential for preventing sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design of piezo-ionotropic multi-resonance acoustic sensor</title><p id="Par7">Sound transmission in the human auditory system involves several stages: vibration of the tympanic membrane, conduction through the ossicles, and generation of pressure waves within the cochlea, which displace the basilar membrane (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The basilar membrane plays a critical role in auditory perception, varying in width and stiffness along its length to decompose complex acoustic signals into their constituent frequencies. This frequency decomposition is essential for the next stage of auditory perception, where ionotropic mechanotransduction occurs in hair cells located on the basilar membrane. Vibrations of the basilar membrane cause the bending of cilia on these hair cells, which stretches the tip links and activates ion channels (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This sequence allows cations to enter the hair cells, generating the receptor potential necessary for sound detection. Despite the efficiency of this mechanism, hair cells are extremely delicate, and because they cannot regenerate, any damage leads to irreversible sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, rightmost).<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Conceptual design of the PiMAS inspired by basilar membrane in the biological auditory system.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic representation of a biological basilar membrane in both coiled and uncoiled states. <bold>b</bold> Response mechanism of the basilar membrane to sound and characterization of its non-regenerative properties. <bold>c</bold> Schematic illustration of PiMAS, mimicking the topology and sensing capabilities of the basilar membrane. <bold>d</bold> Schematic showing the ShPiP components including SFPU and [BMIM]&#8314;[TFSI]&#8315;, along with the Independent Gradient Model (IGM) analysis and labeled binding energies BG1 ([BMIM]<sup>+</sup> &amp; [TFSI]&#8315;) = &#8722;87.60&#8201;kcal/mol and BG2 ([BMIM]<sup>+</sup> &amp; [TFSI]&#8315; with fluorine groups) = &#8722;81.04&#8201;kcal/mol. <bold>e</bold> Sensing mechanism of the PiMAS and its self-healing capability, aimed at preventing sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).</p></caption><graphic id="d33e451" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="41467_2025_63643_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">Inspired by this human ionotropic mechanotransduction mechanism and the structural features of basilar membranes, we have developed a sustainable PiMAS, comprising eight channels, each formed by ShPiP and AgNWs interdigitated electrodes.

Attraction between the fluorine group and [BMIM]<sup>+</sup> reduced the binding energy between [BMIM]<sup>+</sup> and [TFSI]&#8315; to &#8211;81.04&#8201;kcal/mol, indicating that the fluorine group in SFPU acts as an ion-hitching site, capable of forming ion-dipole interactions with [BMIM]<sup>+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Subsequently, we validated the aforementioned calculations by characterizing the asymmetric stretching bands of S&#8201;=&#8201;O and N&#8211;S of [TFSI]&#8315; in ShPiP, as well as the associated and free carbonyl groups, using infrared spectroscopy (detailed description in Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a, b</xref> and Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

In its quiescent state, the hard segments of the SFPU are associated through dipole-dipole interactions among fluorine groups and hydrogen-bonding, forming a closed hard domain where ions maintain a dynamic equilibrium both inside and outside. When sound vibrations bend PiMAS channels, the resulting stretch causes the associated hard segments of the ShPiP to separate, creating interstitial passages within the hard domains where ions are captured under the effect of ion-dipole interactions. This process further restricts the ions and accentuates the impedance increase induced by stretching, thereby enhancing sensitivity. In addition, to overcome the limitations of non-regenerative hair cells and SNHL, the acoustic sensor is designed to possess self-healing capabilities in conventional environments, water and lymphatic fluid. This self-healing capability is driven by the synergistic effects of dynamic disulfide bond exchange, dipole-dipole interactions among fluorine groups and the enhanced chain mobility due to the plasticizing effect of the ionic liquid (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> rightmost). Additionally, the strong hydrophobic properties conferred by the polybutadiene structure and fluorine groups within the ShPiP, coupled with the weak miscibility of [BMIM]<sup>+</sup>[TFSI]&#8315; with water, ensure that these driving forces remain unaffected by water molecules, facilitating underwater self-healing capabilities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Discrimination ability of the PiMAS for sound frequency and sound pressure</title><p id="Par10">We first assessed the resolution of the PiMAS with respect to sound pressure and frequency. The PiMAS was positioned between a speaker and a laser vibrometer and concurrently connected to an LCR meter for synchronous monitoring of impedance and amplitude changes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The distribution of ShPiP and AgNW interdigitated electrodes within each channel of the PiMAS is depicted in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, with the fabrication method detailed in Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref> and Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>.

The cross-sectional image (right) shows that the AgNW layer rests atop the ShPiP matrix with partial embedding within the surface, forming an intimate and conformal interface. This layered architecture facilitates efficient stress transfer and signal transduction under acoustically induced vibration. When sound vibrations induce deformation in the channel, the impedance changed because of variations in ion flux within the ShPiP.

Beyond 803&#8201;Hz, the amplitude of Channel 1 remained unchanged. A comparison of the impedance and amplitude profiles revealed a close correspondence in their characteristic response frequencies to acoustic stimuli.

The AgNW electrodes demonstrated remarkably stable impedance throughout the test due to their inherent stretchability, confirming that the conversion of mechanical sound stimuli into electrical signals was primarily facilitated by the ShPiP. Furthermore, we tested the sensitivity of Channel 1 at its maximum resonant frequency by varying the sound pressure (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). As the sound pressure gradually increased from 65&#8201;dB to 91&#8201;dB, the response impedance also increased correspondingly, yielding a sensitivity of 530&#8201;kPa<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (inset in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). At this point, it is worth noting that Channel 1 exhibits a steadily increasing impedance response under fixed-frequency sound pressure stimulation, while displaying a typical resonance behavior during frequency sweeps at constant pressure, as shown in Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref> (Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

The sound pressure sensitivity of channels 1&#8211;8 at their maximum resonant frequencies was summarized in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>. An increase in thickness resulted in a slight decrease in sensitivity, as the channel thickness influenced its deformation magnitude under same sound pressure according to Newton&#8217;s second law<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, all channels exhibited sufficiently high-pressure sensitivity (350&#8211;530&#8201;kPa<sup>&#8722;1</sup>).</p><p id="Par14">Since acoustic vibrations induce tensile strain within the sensing channels, the gauge factor (GF) can be calculated based on this strain. To ensure accurate estimation and prevent potential overestimation caused by localized stress concentrations, we performed finite element analysis (FEA) to assess strain distribution (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref> and Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Simulation results revealed that over 90% of the strain is concentrated in the central region of the sensing channel, exhibiting uniform strain distribution. This region includes the interdigitated electrode (IDE) array, where primary ion migration and impedance variations occur. Although localized stress concentrations were observed near the clamped boundaries, these peripheral regions do not significantly influence the sensing response, making their impact on impedance change negligible. Therefore, provided the uniform strain distribution in the core sensing region is maintained, GF can be reliably estimated from the overall tensile strain without significant error from localized stress effects.</p><p id="Par15">Furthermore, FEA results indicate that while increasing the channel thickness (100&#8201;&#956;m, 400&#8201;&#956;m, and 700&#8201;&#956;m) slightly reduces the overall strain magnitude, strain uniformity in the core sensing region remains consistently stable. Additionally, simulations performed at various acoustic frequencies (100&#8201;Hz and 4000&#8201;Hz) confirm that the deformation patterns within the primary sensing region remain uniform, although strain magnitudes differ with frequency. Leveraging this FEA-validated strain uniformity, we calculated the gauge factors (GFs) for these channels (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref> and Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and summarized the results in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>.

This structural change facilitates ion-dipole interactions between the [BMIM]<sup>+</sup>[TFSI]<sup>&#8722;</sup> ions and the fluorine groups within the polyurethane&#8217;s hard segments, forming the foundation of the impedance-based sensing response. Simultaneously, an external electric field prompts the migration of ions towards the electrodes. Consequently, the total ion flux driven by tensile stress is governed by the competitive relationship between the strength of ion-dipole interactions and electric field-induced ion migration. To explore this complex ion flux pathway, we utilized in-situ Raman spectroscopy for ionic intensity mapping at three distinct locations in the ShPiP samples: adjacent to the anode (Position-1#), intermediate (Position-2#), and adjacent to the cathode (Position-3#).

At Position-2#, cations were uniformly distributed across the region due to equal distance from both electrodes, with slight aggregation on the upper side possibly due to longitudinal compression of the polymer chains, while maintaining a uniform lateral distribution. At Position-3#, cations attracted to the right cathode were biased towards the right with a distribution that remained nearly unchanged post-stretching. Regarding the anions ([TFSI]&#8315;) in both ShPiP and PU-iongel, freed from polymer chain constraints (Supplementary Figs.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20</xref> and Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), they migrated leftwards under longitudinal compression and electric field drive.

In these simulations, the stick model represents [BMIM]<sup>+</sup>, which is the main component of interest, while [TFSI]&#8315; and PU are displayed in line model format as the matrix background, providing visual emphasis on the cation dynamics. [BMIM]<sup>+</sup> exhibited a slight migration trend toward the cathode in both systems due to the applied electric field, with a more pronounced accumulation observed in PU-iongel (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, blue curve). Upon application of 100% tensile strain, PU-iongel showed a prominent cation concentration gradient consistent with field- and compression-coupled piezoionic migration (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, red curve). In contrast, the ShPiP system showed only minor redistribution of [BMIM]<sup>+</sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), suggesting a suppressed migration trend due to ion-dipole interactions with fluorinated segments, which act as structural barriers, thereby supporting the proposed &#8220;ion hitching-in cage&#8221; mechanism. These trends closely match the ion distribution observed in Raman mapping (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>), further validating the fluorine-induced suppression of cation migration.</p><p id="Par20">Together with the experimental data, these simulation results reinforce the structural model described below (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e, f</xref>), in which fluorinated domains behave as reversible cage-like ion traps under acoustic deformation. In the ion flux process, the hard domains containing fluorine groups functioned like a closed cage (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Acoustic pressure-induced stretching could form interstitial passages in these domains, creating ion-accessible pathways similar to an open cage. In the PU-iongel (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref> left), cations were captured but could escape after multiple interactions due to weaker ion-dipole interactions. This resulted in only slight reductions in cation mobility. In contrast, in ShPiP (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> right), stronger ion-dipole interactions between the fluorine groups and [BMIM]<sup>+</sup> restricted cation mobility more effectively, leading to greater impedance changes and enhanced sensitivity. To further validate the ion hitching-in cage effect in ShPiP, we analyzed the temperature-dependent ionic conductivity of both PU-iongel and ShPiP under unstrained conditions and under 1% tensile strain (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">22</xref> and Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The results revealed that ShPiP exhibited a more pronounced increase in activation energy under strain, suggesting that the hard domains impose stronger constraints on ion migration through ion&#8211;dipole interactions. This indicates that ion mobility is effectively restricted by the strain-induced enhancement of these interactions.</p><p id="Par21">A comparison of strain-impedance curves (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">23a</xref> and Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) indicated that the ion hitching-in cage effect in ShPiP resulted in higher stretch sensitivity than in PU-iongel. In the PU-NH-iongel variant with fewer hard domains, based on SPU-NH (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">23b&#8211;d</xref> and Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), the ion hitching-in cage effect was minimal, resulting in reduced sensitivity. Moreover, the ion hitching-in cage effect in ShPiP showed stable and reversible behavior. FTIR analysis demonstrated that the hard domains temporarily opened under mechanical stress but fully returned to their original state upon unloading, even after 100 cycles of tensile deformation (Supplementary Figs.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">24</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">25</xref> and Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This reversible microstructural behavior significantly minimizes hysteresis by reducing internal energy dissipation during loading-unloading cycles, thereby enhancing consistency of dynamic response and suppressing signal drift under cyclic mechanical loading (Supplementary Figs.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">26</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">27</xref> and Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Consequently, PiMAS achieves a balanced performance, combining high sensitivity with practical reliability. In contrast, PU-iongel without fluorinated moieties exhibited irreversible structural changes and significant signal degradation. Regarding dynamic response, PiMAS rapidly altered its impedance upon application and removal of acoustic stimuli, exhibiting a typical response time of 25&#8211;28&#8201;ms (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">27c, d</xref>).

We achieved these objectives through the molecular design of ShPiP. Specifically, polybutadiene was selected as the soft segment to enhance the overall hydrophobicity of the polyurethane, followed by the introduction of fluorine groups into the hard segments to further increase hydrophobicity. Additionally, disulfide bonds were incorporated into the hard segments to impart self-healing capability to the resulting polyurethanes. The self-healing process is primarily driven by dynamic disulfide bond exchange and fluorine dipole-dipole interactions, with the disulfide bond exchange serving as the fundamental self-healing mechanism. Material recovery is achieved through the rearrangement of disulfide bonds at the fractured interface. Concurrently, fluorine dipole-dipole interactions play a critical role during the initial stage of fracture by enhancing attraction between molecular segments. This interaction helps bring fractured surfaces into closer proximity, thereby accelerating the disulfide bond exchange process and significantly improving self-healing efficiency (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">28</xref> and Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par23">Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) revealed that SFPU molecular chains tightly cluster together, distinctly separating from water molecule aggregates.

Composed of ShPiP and AgNW interdigitated electrodes, PiMAS efficiently converts sound stimuli into mechanical vibrations, detecting frequencies across a range of 20&#8211;3300&#8201;Hz and sound pressures above 65&#8201;dB with high sensitivity to sound pressure (530&#8201;kPa<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and stretch (53.6), surpassing most ionic sensors. This sensitivity is primarily due to the ion hitching-in cage effect, driven by ion-dipole interactions between SFPU and [BMIM]&#8314;[TFSI]&#8315; within ShPiP, which restricts cation flux, resulting in more pronounced impedance changes.</p><p id="Par30">Moreover, ShPiP&#8217;s self-healing capability in conventional environments, underwater, and even in lymphatic fluid is attributed to a combination of dynamic disulfide bond exchange, fluorine-group dipole-dipole interactions, and increased chain mobility due to the ionic liquid&#8217;s plasticizing effect. PiMAS effectively differentiates the voice frequencies among our volunteers and accurately detects characteristic frequencies of various piano keys, demonstrating reliable responsiveness to singing voices compared to commercial acoustic sensors.

The tensile process was performed incrementally by extending the simulation box in the z-direction at an engineering strain rate of 5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>9&#8201;</sup>fs<sup>&#8211;1</sup>, while keeping the x and y dimensions fixed. Six different model configurations were subjected to the same protocol. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle&#8211;particle particle&#8211;mesh (PPPM) method to accurately capture Coulombic forces via numerical solution of the Poisson equation. Although the experimental strain was only 1%, strain amplification to 100% was adopted in the MD simulations due to the nanoscale periodic structure and to enhance signal resolution. This strategy is widely adopted for probing microscopic mechanisms in soft-matter systems and does not compromise the consistency between simulation and experimental interpretation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.
