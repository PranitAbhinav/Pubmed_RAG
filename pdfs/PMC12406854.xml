Of these, 89 were patients, 10 were relatives, 19 were healthcare professionals and 12 were representatives of patient organisations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>1314 potential research questions were submitted; 62 unique questions remained after analysis. 130 and 123 people answered the first and second Delphi surveys, respectively. 20 questions were discussed by 13 participants at the final priority-setting meeting. The following five research questions were selected as a top priority: (1) what criteria should apply for a diagnosis of lipoedema? (2) What outcomes are important in lipoedema research? (3) What effect does manual treatment, such as manual lymphatic drainage have on lipoedema? (4) What effect does liposuction have on lipoedema? (5) What are the effects of hormonal treatment on lipoedema?</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found a consensus between patients and healthcare professionals on topics that warrant priority in future research into lipoedema. The questions reflect both the diagnosis of the condition and research on treatment effects. We hope the results will inform researchers and research funders, and direct future studies towards important research questions.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Lipid disorders</kwd><kwd>Research Design</kwd><kwd>Patient Participation</kwd><kwd>Embolism, Fat</kwd><kwd>Patient Preference</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>The method of this project is inspired by the James Lind Alliance handbook and follows a robust methodology.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The project has ensured patients, relatives and relevant healthcare professionals&#8217; involvement in all stages of the project.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We ensured that the priorities of the different stakeholder groups were given equal weighting at the interim priority-setting stage.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Both the identification and prioritisation of research questions are done in Sweden, and the application in other settings might be limited.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A broad dissemination was conducted to ensure the participation of the relevant stakeholders in the project; it is always possible that some groups were not reached, for example, different minority groups, younger and older people.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p> Lipoedema is a chronic, progressive condition affecting essentially women, which can result in considerable disability.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 2</sup></xref> It is characterised by an abnormal accumulation of fat, mainly on the hips, buttocks and legs; the arms might also be affected.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3 4</sup></xref> Common symptoms include pain, tenderness, sensitivity to pressure, bruising readily and a feeling of heaviness in the affected area.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> A systematic review by the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services (SBU), published in 2021, identified no scientific studies with low or moderate risk of bias that assessed diagnostic tests for lipoedema or methods for differential diagnosis.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> In the existing literature, diagnosis is mainly based on clinical and anamnestic criteria.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, in the absence of diagnostic tests or an internationally accepted consensus on diagnostic criteria, underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis is probably common, and the prevalence is therefore uncertain.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 7</sup></xref> Concerning treatment or cure, there is a lack of research studies with an acceptable risk of bias.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 8</sup></xref> Hence, there is uncertainty about the effects of all available treatments.

The purpose of this project is to investigate and raise awareness regarding these important research questions.</p><p>As inspiration for this project, we have drawn on the non-profit British organisation, James Lind Alliance (JLA).

The result from the PSPs aims to broaden the perspective and foster the contribution of healthcare professionals and patients in setting the research agenda. The reason we have chosen to use this method is primarily that it is considered a robust process with a defined methodology, well described in the available guidebook.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This work was conducted as a part of a governmental assignment given to SBU, a public agency conducting health technology assessments.

This was in response to the lack of international consensus on diagnostic criteria, contributing to uncertainty about the condition and the diagnosis. A consensus is also important for the validity of future research studies. The participants pointed out that many people with lipoedema struggle to get a diagnosis and that the time elapsing between the initial consultation and establishment of a correct diagnosis may be unreasonably long. They believed that more research into diagnostic criteria and research on biomarkers could lead not only to more accurate and rapid diagnosis and treatment but also to changes in attitude towards lipoedema patients seeking care.</p><p>Also prioritised was the question of which outcomes should be measured in research studies on lipoedema. It is important to measure outcomes that are of importance to both patients and healthcare professionals. The participants emphasised that current research often focuses on Body Mass Index, weight or volume. While convenient to measure, these outcomes do not necessarily correlate with changes in other outcomes of greater relevance to patients, such as well-being and quality of life.</p><p>It was proposed that priority be given to evaluate the effect of manual treatments, such as MLD or connective tissue massage, on lipoedema. The group argued that many find these treatments effective and therefore, they are requested; hence, it is important to have more knowledge about their effects. Compared with liposuction, these treatments are also less invasive and less resource-demanding. A further recommendation was to prioritise research into combinations of manual treatments and other treatment options, for example, the effects of manual treatment after liposuction.</p><p>One of the other treatment modalities for which priority was recommended was liposuction and its effect on different symptoms. The group&#8217;s opinion was that in some patients, liposuction might have a major influence on their ability to stay active and improve their quality of life. Several related questions were raised, such as whether lipoedema recurs after liposuction and, if so, how rapidly, which is the optimal method of liposuction, and whether liposuction can be used as a preventive measure to avoid common sequelae such as arthrosis.</p><p>As hormone treatment is quite common and might affect lipoedema, the group recommended greater priority for research on this subject. The group considered it important for females diagnosed with lipoedema, or who have a familial history of lipoedema, to be able to make informed choices when starting hormone treatment, such as contraceptive pills or oestrogen treatment. Another research issue for which priority was recommended was how the body would respond to the withdrawal of hormone treatment.</p><p>The question of the effects of physiotherapy was broadened to include the effects of different interventions and health professions which focus on the patient&#8217;s daily life, activity and function, such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists, counsellors, orthopaedic technicians and dieticians. Here, the group recommended more research into interventions that facilitate normal daily functions. In their argument in support of broadening the question, the group stated that these interventions are often undertaken by healthcare personnel other than physiotherapists and that this would offer an opportunity for broader research.</p><p>Research focusing on the effect of food and diet was also prioritised. The group was very clear that they prioritised research on diets with a focus on healthy lifestyles, which could be adhered to for an extended period of time: the focus should be on the quality of life, health and well-being rather than on slimming and weight loss.</p><p>Another question recommended for research priority was the efficacy of compression in the form of compression garments, treatment and pumps. The group argued that many people with lipoedema experienced symptomatic relief from compression. These are also interventions that can be used in daily life and at home. If effective, these interventions could be an important part of lipoedema patients&#8217; self-care.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we describe the application of the JLA method to identify the research questions regarding lipoedema that patients and healthcare professionals regard as most important. Several questions about diagnostic methods and diagnostic criteria were recommended for priority, as well as the evaluation of different treatments.</p><p>To our knowledge, no previous study has addressed the prioritisation of research questions in lipoedema. While several consensus documents and reviews exist,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 5 7 15 16</sup></xref> the overall knowledge of lipoedema still has significant gaps.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> In large, there is a need for research on the lipoedema condition at all levels and all areas. We hope that this prioritisation will lead to an increase in research directed at the lipoedema condition.</p><p>The results reveal that the uncertainty of treatment effectiveness is of central concern to patients and caregivers alike. More than half the questions recommended for priority concerned the issue of evaluation of treatment. Very little is known about this topic, and the demand for further knowledge is high. The treatments listed in the prioritisation were selected as those most in need of research. Some are already applied globally in clinical practice. Another question of highly rated priority is the outcome of such studies: evaluation of the effectiveness of the treatments is less relevant if the outcomes are not important to the patients affected. One way of investigating which outcomes are meaningful is the development of a core outcome set (COS). Questions about diagnosis were also highly prioritised: prolonged suffering is more likely in the absence of a diagnosis and an explanation for their symptoms. Without validated diagnostic methods, there is additional uncertainty as to whether patients have received the correct diagnosis.</p><p>The result has been communicated to relevant researchers, funders and policymakers in Sweden and is now shared with an international audience in the current paper. One way to evaluate the impact is to update the systematic review done by SBU in the future.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>In this project, prioritising was based on the JLA method. It is constructed on consensus principles, whereby each group, through discussion, arrives at a consensus. The strength of the method lies in its inclusiveness, whereby patients and healthcare personnel work together as equal participants. Although most of the participants had lipoedema themselves, the responses to the questionnaire were weighted to ensure that every perspective was given an equal opportunity to influence the results.</p><p>A prerequisite for the method is that the knowledge and experience of every participant are acknowledged to be of equal value and application to the project. This method requires that all participants understand that everyone must have a chance to be heard and have a pragmatic approach facilitated by independent moderators, in this case, by SBU.</p><p>To our knowledge, no other priority-setting focusing on lipoedema research has been undertaken. A strength is the response and engagement in the initial survey, identifying research questions, as well as the relatively high frequency of responses to both questionnaires, 77% and 73%, respectively. Moreover, after the final priority-setting meeting, the top list was sent to all participants for perusal and comments in order to consolidate the results. There were only a few responses, none of which were negative comments about the final list.</p><p>The decision to not rank the prioritised research questions from 1 to 10 might be considered a limitation as well as a strength. As facilitators, we worked very hard on inclusiveness, listening to other thoughts and reasoning, and that process includes you making compromises sometimes. During the priority-setting meeting, the group was very pleased with the results, having separated five questions as more important and being in consensus that they did not want to prioritise them further. As facilitators, SBU did not push the group further on this issue; we considered that this was the result that this group was most comfortable with.</p><p>In the initial survey, we chose to collect as little personal information as possible to keep it as anonymous as possible. This means that we cannot be sure that research questions relevant to possible subgroups have been identified. Such subgroups could be different minority groups, such as young girls or the elderly. When analysing the question, we considered the material to be saturated since almost all the included questions were suggested multiple times and from different perspectives. This repetition of supplied questions with only minor variation would suggest that the material is saturated.</p><p>Recruitment to the project was achieved by an open interest submission on the SBU website. The choice of an open expression of interest in participating means that selection is not random: there can be bias as to which people choose to apply and participate in projects such as these. There is always a risk that such information does not reach certain sections of the population or that they find the procedure of suggesting research questions or prioritising research onerous. Examples of such groups can be people of foreign backgrounds, people with disabilities and the elderly. Most of those who expressed an interest in participating were people with personal experience of the disease. Healthcare professionals comprised the smallest group. We can only speculate why there were fewer expressions of interest among healthcare personnel: one reason may be that healthcare workers have little knowledge of the condition and limited contact with patients with lipoedema. It is also possible that our recruitment methods failed to reach out adequately to healthcare personnel. Also, no working group can cover all perspectives, and it is acknowledged that a different group, comprising other participants, might have produced different results.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> There might have been a larger group participating in the first individual prioritisation survey if this had been an open survey where no registration was required, a method often used by the JLA. However, this procedure means you have less control over who responds to the survey. The method used in this process, where you register for participation, also allows all of those participating to give feedback on the final result.</p><p>The work was undertaken with only Swedish participants; the prioritisation, therefore, reflects a Swedish context. Some research questions and needs might not be applicable elsewhere.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The project has resulted in recommendations for research priorities for lipoedema, which highlight the need for more research into commonly used interventions and a demand for more knowledge about the effects of these interventions by both patients and healthcare professionals. It also shows the importance of more precise diagnostic tools and consensus on the diagnostic criteria. Such results would not only benefit patients but also contribute to better research into lipoedema. Also noted was the need for research focusing on the most important outcome. The development of a COS can influence research to focus on important outcomes. A COS can also contribute to research that is more easily compiled in systematic reviews, thus increasing the evidence base for the condition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-086869</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s001.docx" id="d67e664" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP2" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-086869</object-id><label>online supplemental file 2</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s002.docx" id="d67e669" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP3" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-086869</object-id><label>online supplemental file 3</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s003.docx" id="d67e674" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP4" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-086869</object-id><label>online supplemental file 4</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s004.docx" id="d67e679" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was made possible through the fantastic engagement of a large number of people.
