Managing AKI is a critical niche in healthcare, requiring timely diagnosis, addressing underlying causes, and sometimes necessitating renal replacement therapy [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Biomarkers and the assessment of immune infiltration have become invaluable tools in the diagnosis and management of AKI [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In AKI diagnosis, biomarkers like serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen are commonly used to assess kidney damage. However, these traditional markers have limitations, including delayed elevation after kidney injury and lack of specificity [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Newer biomarkers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) can detect kidney injury earlier than traditional markers and offer greater sensitivity and specificity [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Meanwhile, evaluating immune infiltration involving immune cells like neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells in kidney tissues is crucial for assessing AKI severity, as increased immune infiltration exacerbates inflammation and kidney damage through pro-inflammatory molecule release and immune pathway activation [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Despite significant accomplishments in AKI biomarker research and immune infiltration analysis, a notable gap persists in biomarkers related to these processes in AKI [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>AKI can be caused by a rapid loss of renal tubular epithelial cells and subsequent inflammatory cascades [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. PANoptosis is a recently discovered cellular mechanism that plays a critical role in regulating cell death and immune responses. It has been identified as a biomarker for the early diagnosis or prognosis of various diseases, such kidney cancer [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], diabetic retinopathy [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], aortic dissection [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This process involves the activation of a combination of programmed cell death pathways, containing necroptosis, apoptosis, and pyroptosis, and is controlled by a set of PANoptosis-related genes [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In AKI, PANoptosis has emerged as a significant contributor to the pathophysiology. Primary insults such as nephrotoxic substances and ischemia&#8211;reperfusion, along with secondary insults including inflammatory cytokines, can trigger PANoptosis in the kidney, leading to AKI through complex interactions between different cell death pathways [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19&#8211;21</xref>]. Furthermore, PANoptosis is closely intertwined with immune infiltration, as the release of inflammatory signals from dying cells can attract immune cells into the kidney tissues [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. PANoptosis-related genes such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily genes and caspases have been implicated in cell death and inflammation in AKI [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the potential clinical significance of PANoptosis-related genes in serving as biomarkers for AKI and their intricate associations with immune infiltration remain largely unknown. Identification of PANoptosis-related genes can not only provide evidences for the early detection of AKI and assessing AKI severity by clinicians, but also holds potential for the prevention, treatment, and recovery of AKI by regulating PANoptosis.</p><p>Combined machine learning approaches in bioinformatics can efficiently process complex biological data and identify potential biomarkers that are difficult to detect with traditional methods. Additionally, it can screen out highly specific biomarkers and build more reliable diagnostic models. Here, a comprehensive bioinformatic analyses was performed based on transcriptomic data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify PANoptosis-related feature genes in AKI. We assessed their diagnostic accuracy in different datasets, explored their interactions with immune infiltration, and evaluated potential therapeutic implications. The feature genes identified in this research may enhance the accurate prediction and diagnosis of AKI, offering valuable insights onto therapeutic strategies for management of AKI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" disp-level="1" id="S0002"><label>2.</label><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="S0002-S2001"><label>2.1.</label><title>Data acquisition and processing</title><p>Transcriptional expression profiles were procured from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository at <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>, particularly utilizing <ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE30718">GSE30718</ext-link> as the training cohort and <ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE217427">GSE217427</ext-link> as the validation cohort (<xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). GEO database allows researchers to download and analyze public datasets for scientific purposes. As this study utilized publicly available data without involving direct collection from human participants, it was exempt from ethical approval requirements under local institutional review board guidelines. Compliance with GEO data access and publication policies also confirms that ethical approval was not required. The Medical Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University has reviewed this study and exempted the ethics for usage of public database (approval number: No. 2024CL205-01). For preprocessing, each dataset underwent a mapping process where probes were aligned to corresponding gene identifiers, with those probes lacking a significant signal being excluded. In instances where multiple probes aligned to a single gene, the median expression value among those probes was utilized as the representative value for that gene. Subsequently, normalization of the datasets was executed employing the &#8216;normalizeBetweenArrays&#8217; functionality within the &#8216;limma&#8217; R package. Regarding the acquisition of PANoptosis-associated genes, two seminal publications served as the foundation. The first study identified an array of 277 genes, segregated into 242 genes tied to apoptosis, 8 genes linked to necroptosis, and 27 genes pertinent to pyroptosis [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Complementing this, the second publication contributed an additional 36 genes related to necroptosis [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Merging these two comprehensive gene lists resulted in a consolidated set of 313 genes that are intimately involved in the PANoptosis process.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="t0001" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Data sources and sample information.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="80pt" span="1"/><col width="80pt" span="1"/><col width="80pt" span="1"/><col width="80pt" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">ID</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Platform</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Sample type</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Sample size (AKI:control)</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE30718">GSE30718</ext-link></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GPL570">GPL570</ext-link></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">AKI and control biopsies</td><td align="char" char="." colspan="1" rowspan="1">47(28:19)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE217427">GSE217427</ext-link></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GPL24676">GPL24676</ext-link></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">AKI and control biopsies</td><td align="char" char="." colspan="1" rowspan="1">44(22:22)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF1"><p>AKI, acute kidney injury.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0002-S2002"><label>2.2.</label><title>Identification of DEGs related to PANoptosis</title><p>The process of differential gene expression analysis was executed on the <ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE30718">GSE30718</ext-link> dataset utilizing the powerful R package, &#8216;limma.&#8217; Genes displaying a statistical significance with a <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> value &lt;0.05 were identified as DEGs.

CASP8 was closely correlated with activated dendritic cells, and FAS was significantly associated with effector memory CD4 T cells (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C&#8211;G</xref>). To study the therapeutic implications of the feature genes, we conducted an analysis using the DGIdb database. CASP1 was prominent with a substantial number of associated drugs, including VX-765, a targeted caspase activity inhibitor. In contrast, SFN appeared to have a narrower interaction profile, notably with the well-known cancer drug imatinib. FAS also had significant drug associations, while CASP4 and CASP8 showed fewer interactions (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>; <ext-link xlink:href="10.1080/07853890.2025.2553930" ext-link-type="doi">Table S7</ext-link>).

These feature genes, including CASP8, CASP4, SFN, FAS, and CASP1, were found to be associated with AKI and displayed strong correlations with immune cell infiltration, suggesting their potential as diagnostic biomarkers. Additionally, their positive associations with specific immune cells and the availability of drugs targeting these genes indicate potential therapeutic implications, highlighting the clinical significance of these findings for improving AKI diagnosis and treatment. The validation results in the RIRI rat model further confirmed the substantial upregulation of CASP4, SFN, FAS, and CASP1, reinforcing their relevance as biomarkers.</p><p>Vigorous research in the field of AKI focuses on pathophysiological features, including topics such as oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, necrosis, metabolic dysregulation, and immune responses. However, current researches of PANoptosis in AKI are limited. In this study, CASP1, CASP4, and CASP8 were identified as feature genes associated with PANoptosis in AKI. They were upregulated in AKI patients and showed significant correlations with PANoptosis scores, indicating their potential as diagnostic biomarkers. CASP8 displayed the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.850) in the training dataset. While the diagnostic performance varied slightly in the validation dataset, these genes demonstrate strong potential for AKI diagnosis. The caspase family of proteins plays a pivotal role in the complex landscape of cell death pathways, influencing various processes in AKI. CASP1 plays a critical role in regulating pyroptosis, a programmed cell death process characterized by gasdermin D cleavage and membrane pore formation in AKI. Its activation leads to cell swelling, membrane rupture, and death, along with the release of inflammatory factors like IL-18 and IL-1&#946;, <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the NLRP3 inflammasome, contributing to the inflammatory response and cell death in AKI [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. CASP4, along with CAPS5 and CAPS11, is activated independently of inflammasomes, primarily by lipopolysaccharide binding, and is crucial for cleaving gasdermin D, leading to pyroptosis and associated inflammatory responses in AKI [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. CASP8 serves as a central regulator in the intricate network of cell death pathways. It activates apoptosis by interacting with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein and enhances the apoptotic cascade while inhibiting necroptosis [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. CASP8 also plays a role in the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis, with its activation affecting the transition between these pathways [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our results may help in understanding these interactions and developing potential therapeutic strategies for AKI.</p><p>We also identified SFN and FAS as feature genes associated with immune responses in AKI. Both genes were positively correlated with the PANoptosis score, indicating their involvement in PANoptosis signaling in AKI. Consistent with our findings, researchers have observed elevated SFN levels in AKI patients and mouse models. In human kidney cells and mouse models, knocking down SFN reduced kidney injury markers, mitigated programmed cell death, and suppressed inflammation. SFN also interacts with RIPK3, a key regulator of necroptosis, leading to necroptosis and subsequent inflammation in kidney cells [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In AKI, the FAS (Fas cell surface death receptor) system is involved in initiating extrinsic apoptosis, primarily through the binding of FAS ligand (FASL) to the FAS receptor on renal cells. Activation of FAS receptor triggers a cascade of signaling pathways that lead to the activation of initiator caspases (mainly CASP8 and CASP10) and subsequently effector caspases (CASP3, 6, and 7), ultimately inducing apoptosis in renal cells [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38&#8211;40</xref>]. Additionally, FAS can contribute to necroptosis in AKI, leading to the formation of a necroptosome containing RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, ultimately resulting in cell death [<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, FAS is implicated in both apoptosis and necroptosis in AKI.</p><p>Our results indicate that in AKI patients, there was an increased abundance of various immune cell types, with significant differences observed in 15 immune cell types when compared to the control group, suggesting an enhanced immune response in AKI. Additionally, the feature genes identified in AKI patients were positively correlated with different immune cell types. Notably, CASP1, CASP4, and SFN exhibited strong positive correlations with Th1 cells, while CASP8 was closely associated with activated dendritic cells, and FAS showed a significant correlation with effector memory CD4 T cells. Indeed, immune cells like dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes play roles in causing kidney damage during AKI. Conversely, M2 macrophages and Tregs help suppress inflammation and support tissue repair after AKI [<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In AKI, T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement contributes to renal injury after ischemia&#8211;reperfusion injury, involving both TCR-repertoire-dependent and -independent factors [<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Blocking FASL reduces renal injury by limiting TNF-producing T-cell infiltration into post-ischemic kidneys. In cisplatin-induced AKI, T cells, especially CD4+ T cells, play a crucial role in renal injury [<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. CD4-deficient mice demonstrate lower mortality and renal impairment compared to wild-type counterparts [<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Cisplatin-induced AKI pathogenesis involves FASL-mediated apoptosis, triggered by FASL expression in renal tubular cells and infiltrating immune cells, especially T lymphocytes.[<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Our results emphasize the critical role of immune infiltration and the feature genes in AKI pathogenesis, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets for mitigating immune responses and tissue damage in AKI.</p><p>The feature genes CASP1, CASP4, CASP8, SFN, and FAS in AKI patients showed varying drug associations, with CASP1 and FAS having numerous drug interactions, while CASP4, CASP8, and SFN were notably associated with specific drugs. In the drug&#8211;gene network, some compounds are known to be involved in inflammation and PANoptosis. Cyclophosphamide, for instance, can suppress the immune system and is used in immune therapies for autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation [<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for mitigating the progression of diabetic nephropathy, as it effectively suppresses caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis, renal inflammation, and fibrosis in diabetic mice [<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Vitamin K1 has been identified as an effective inhibitor of ferroptosis, offering a promising strategy for preventing this mode of cell death in conditions like acute tubular necrosis during AKI [<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These data suggest that targeting the identified feature genes may hold promise for developing novel therapeutic approaches for AKI.</p><p>One limitation involves the dependence on bioinformatics and gene expression analyses, which might overlook the dynamic complexity of AKI in clinical contexts. The findings are primarily based on gene expression patterns, and further experimental validation, such as functional assays and clinical studies, is needed to confirm the roles of these identified feature genes and their diagnostic or therapeutic potential in AKI. Additionally, the study relies on publicly available datasets, which may have variations in sample populations and data collection methods, leading to potential biases or discrepancies in the results. More surveys from different countries are still needed. Moreover, while drug associations were explored, the actual efficacy and safety of these drugs in AKI patients were not directly assessed in this study, warranting further investigation and clinical trials. Another limitation is the lack of CASP8 upregulation at mRNA level in the RIRI rat model, possibly due to variations in the experimental conditions or differences in the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms between human AKI and the RIRI rat model. However, the protein level change of CASP8 in rat was consistent with which in human. Finally, more studies with multiple omics methods, such as proteomics and metabolomics, integrate different types of molecular data, which can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the AKI pathophysiology and the role of PANoptosis in AKI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" disp-level="1" id="S0005"><label>5.</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>This research identified and characterized a set of DEGs associated with PANoptosis in AKI.
