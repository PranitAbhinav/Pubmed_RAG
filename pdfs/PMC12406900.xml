This study aimed to assess the impact of living with learning disabilities on T2DM control, therapeutic management, vascular outcomes, and mortality in UK primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Research design and methods</title><p>We conducted an observational cohort study using primary care electronic health records from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. The study included adults newly diagnosed with T2DM from 2004 to 2021. The exposure was learning disability status at the time of diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare glycemic control at 5 years post-diagnosis between people with and without learning disabilities. Multivariable Cox regression was used to compare time to insulin initiation, macrovascular and microvascular complications, and mortality between people with and without learning disabilities.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 280&#8201;300 adults with T2DM included in the study, 2074 (0.74%) had a learning disability at T2DM diagnosis. After adjustment, people with learning disabilities had lower odds of poor glycemic control than those without learning disabilities 5 years after diagnosis (OR=0.81, 95%&#8201;CI 0.70 to 0.94) and faster insulin initiation (HR=1.20, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.45) than those without learning disabilities. The risks of all-cause and diabetes-related mortality were doubled in those with learning disabilities (all-cause HR=2.15, 95%&#8201;CI 1.82 to 2.54; diabetes-related HR=1.93, 95%&#8201;CI 1.32 to 2.80). We found no difference in the risk of vascular complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Individuals with learning disabilities had better glycemic control but shorter time to insulin initiation. This may be related to more frequent diabetes monitoring, or faster advancing T2DM requiring quicker treatment intensification. Despite having similar risks of vascular complications, people with learning disabilities were at higher risk of death. Future research into the mechanisms behind this could help reduce health disparities for people with T2DM and learning disabilities.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd><kwd>Public Health</kwd><kwd>Psychiatry</kwd><kwd>Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><sec><title>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC</title><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>In the UK, mortality rates are substantially higher in adults with learning disabilities, and they are also at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Individuals were excluded from the study if they had less than 6 months follow-up after T2DM diagnosis to improve the data quality.

We found strong evidence to suggest that those with learning disabilities had better glycemic control than those without learning disabilities. However, people with learning disabilities had higher rates of insulin initiation, our proxy for severe diabetes, suggesting that a greater proportion had severe diabetes as they required treatment escalation beyond lifestyle changes and oral antidiabetic medications. While we found no difference in the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications between people with and without learning disabilities, we found strong evidence across both the CPRD and ONS-linked cohorts that people with learning disabilities were at substantially higher risk of all-cause and diabetes-related mortality than those without learning disabilities.</p><p>Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we found that glycemic control was better in individuals with a learning disability. This could be for several reasons. First, HbA1c recording was poorer in those with learning disabilities. GPs who are more diligent at recording HbA1c may also provide superior T2DM care overall. Therefore, the population with complete HbA1c data may have had better glycemic control than the population with missing data, who were disproportionately represented among those with learning disabilities. Another possible explanation is that those with learning disabilities may have had better glycemic control because they are in more frequent contact with primary care.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> This echoes the findings that multimorbid T2DM patients are more likely to be treated with insulin, so often achieve lower HbA1c levels than those without comorbidities.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> This is also combined with findings that show that risk factor management is often better in those with multimorbidity than in those with single conditions.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Another possible contributor could be that those with learning disabilities are more likely to have caregivers or live in assisted living. There is some evidence that among adults with poorly controlled diabetes, those who receive assistance from a caregiver may have higher medication adherence than those without.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Family support in diabetes care has also been associated with improved blood sugar control.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19 20</sup></xref> In this way, the presence of caregivers could potentially lead to better adherence to diabetes monitoring and treatment regimens for those with learning disabilities.</p><p>This aligns with our second finding, namely that people with learning disabilities had higher rates of insulin initiation than those without learning disabilities. Our finding that poor glycemic control at baseline acted as an effect modifier for this relationship suggests that increased insulin use in those with learning disabilities may have been related to poorer glycemic control at diagnosis. This increased insulin use may have then led to people with learning disabilities having better controlled HbA1c throughout the observation period.</p><p>Our finding that people with learning disabilities were at far higher risk of all-cause and diabetes-related mortality echoes those of a similar study which reported that people with learning disabilities are more likely to be hospitalized and have higher mortality due to diabetes-related causes, especially cardiovascular-related complications.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A key strength of this study was the use of large-scale, routinely collected, electronic patient data, which allowed us to study a rare exposure with sufficient statistical power over a substantial follow-up time. We had access to linked deprivation and mortality data, the latter of which enabled us to examine cause-specific mortality in this population.</p><p>The CPRD has been found to be representative of the UK population, ensuring good generalizability, despite the fact that contributing GP practices are not evenly distributed throughout the UK.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Data quality is also generally good for T2DM due to the UK&#8217;s Quality and Outcome Framework (QoF), which provides general practice remuneration for recorded quality of care for chronic conditions including T2DM and learning disabilities.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p><p>Selection bias may have been introduced when using the ONS-linked cohort to examine all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Only 43.17% of the cohort were eligible for ONS-linkage, and the distribution of people with and without learning disabilities differed from that of the whole cohort. However, effect sizes from the analyses of whole cohort and ONS-linked cohorts were comparable, suggesting that selection bias had a limited effect on our findings.</p><p>Those with learning disabilities had a shorter follow-up time than those without a learning disability. This higher loss to follow-up may be due to higher general rates of adverse health events, death, and censoring in this population, introducing selection bias in the form of survivor bias and making the exposure groups less comparable. Differences in follow-up time could also be due to social or structural factors, such as difficulties in communication, care, and transport for people with learning disabilities.</p><p>Of those diagnosed with a learning disability at any point, 438 (17.44%) were diagnosed after their T2DM diagnosis. These patients were therefore classified as unexposed for the duration of the study, resulting in potential exposure misclassification.</p><p>Recording of treatment and complication data is highly dependent on the individual data collection processes in the general practice electronic health record systems. Any variation in quality and completeness of routinely collected data could be related to a multitude of both patient- and GP practice-related factors.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> As CPRD data are GP-recorded health data captured during routine consultations, lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, living situation, and insurance status are infrequently recorded, so they cannot be reliably examined with the available data.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> It is a recognized limitation of the CPRD dataset that there are not generally standardized definitions for diagnoses, which can lead to some subjectivity between data recorders.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p><p>There were large numbers of missing values for the outcome variables for glycemic control. Those with learning disabilities were more likely to have missing glycemic control values both at diagnosis and at 2 and 5 years post-T2DM diagnosis. Following this pattern, it is possible that there may have been either underdiagnosing or under-recording of complications rates in those with learning disabilities compared with those without.</p><p>Missing data, notably HbA1c, were more common in those with learning disabilities than those without, with the difference increasing over time. This increasing missingness may indicate greater loss to follow-up in those with learning disabilities, which may be due to higher rates of adverse health events. As those with learning disabilities have a higher burden of comorbid chronic disease, it is possible that less attention would be given to long-term diabetes care alone while other comorbid illnesses are addressed.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 3</sup></xref> Data completeness may also act as a proxy for healthcare-seeking behavior, while missing data may indicate poorer access to healthcare, poorer quality of care, and poor attendance. This pattern of missing data could lead to an overestimation of the protective effect of learning disability on glycemic control, as those with worse glycemic control may be more likely to have been lost to follow-up at 2 and 5 years. In this way, the high missingness of HbA1c may have partially contributed to the unexpected findings that those with learning disabilities have better glycemic control, biasing our results away from the null hypothesis.</p><p>Another variable with a very large number of missing values is ethnicity, with nearly half of all patients having no ethnicity data. Due to this, there were very low numbers of recorded South Asian, Black, Other, and Mixed ethnicity T2DM patients with learning disabilities. This greatly limited our ability to examine the role of confounding by ethnicity or for the exploration of the differences in the effect of learning disability on T2DM outcomes by ethnicity. Our data suggested that those with learning disabilities had a greater proportion of missing data in these variables. This variability of missingness is a recognized limitation of the CPRD dataset and raises concerns about worse data collection in those with learning disabilities.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Future directions</title><p>Our finding of higher rates of insulin initiation in those with learning disabilities warrants further investigation into whether this is due to poorer glycemic control at presentation (and therefore faster advancing T2DM) or due to having a greater degree of clinical surveillance. The potential damaging effect of overuse of insulin and hypoglycemia, as seen in those with multimorbidity, could also be explored.</p><p>People with learning disabilities often present with multiple comorbidities and have substantially higher rates of health service usage.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Mortality rates are therefore also substantially higher in the learning disability population. However, people with learning disabilities can have difficulties accessing healthcare and can often be faced with social and organizational limitations of care.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> It will also be important to explore the effect of health and social care on T2DM outcomes in people with learning disabilities to understand the extent to which quality and frequency of care have a protective effect. Any shortcomings in healthcare for people with learning disabilities may be related to general barriers to healthcare access for those with learning disabilities, such as overlooked pain, lower screening rates, and insufficient training of staff.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>People with learning disabilities have substantially higher rates of health service usage.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> However, cognitive impairment can lead to difficulties in communicating and being understood by health services.
