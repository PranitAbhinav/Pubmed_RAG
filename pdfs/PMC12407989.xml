Research has shown that the absence of Cdc4, an F-box protein in <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>, decreases virulence, yet the mechanisms by which Cdc4 affects these processes remain unclear. Using an iTRAQ-based proteomic strategy, we recognized Ribonuclease H2 subunit B (Rnh2B) as a target substrate for Cdc4. Protein-protein interaction assays have confirmed the interaction between Cdc4 and Rnh2B, indicating that Cdc4 regulates Rnh2B stability through ubiquitination. Functional analyses revealed that both the knockout and overexpression of <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic> impair growth at 37&#176;C, with the latter also affecting cellular membrane integrity and growth under osmotic stress conditions. Pathogenicity assays revealed that the deletion of <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic> results in reduced virulence, whereas its overexpression leads to a complete loss of pathogenicity. Longitudinal tracking of fungal infection progression illustrated that mice lungs infected with <italic toggle="yes">rnh2B</italic>&#916; mutants maintained a low yet stable fungal burden, in contrast to a significant reduction in fungal load observed in conjunction with <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic> overexpression, ultimately leading to complete clearance. Analysis of host immune responses indicated a correlation between diminished virulence in the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain and robust host immune activation. Notably, both the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain and the <italic toggle="yes">cdc4</italic>&#916; mutant induced analogous adaptive immune responses, facilitating the clearance of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> infection. Collectively, our findings propose a model wherein Cdc4 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of Rnh2B, thereby exerting regulatory control over the pathogenicity of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Cryptococcus neoformans</italic></kwd><kwd>ubiquitin-proteasome system</kwd><kwd>F-box protein</kwd><kwd>Cdc4</kwd><kwd>virulence</kwd><kwd>Rnh2B</kwd></kwd-group><support-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="open-funder-registry">10.13039/501100001809</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32170203</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SWU-XDJH202323</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [32170203] and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [SWU-XDJH202323].</funding-statement></funding-group></support-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="1"/><ref-count count="80"/><page-count count="1"/><word-count count="12872"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" disp-level="1" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is a yeast pathogen with thick capsules recognized for its capability to induce life-threatening cryptococcal meningitis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Globally, it is estimated that there are about 194,100 new cases of cryptococcal infections each year, leading to approximately 147,100 deaths [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Following infection, <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> has developed several adaptations allowing it to colonize and thrive within the host, which includes three classical virulence factors: (i) the capacity to grow at mammalian core temperatures, (ii) the production of a polysaccharide capsule, and (iii) the synthesis of melanin [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Current therapeutic modalities targeting <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> predominantly encompass polyenes (e.g. amphotericin B), the pyrimidine analog (5-fluorocytosine), and azole antifungals (e.g. fluconazole) [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, reliance on monotherapy with these antifungal agents has precipitated a considerable incidence of resistance development. Furthermore, the introduction of novel antifungal agents, specifically echinocandins, has demonstrated limited efficacy against emerging strains of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recent trends indicate an alarming increase in the prevalence of cryptococcal meningitis, attributed to rising numbers of HIV-infected individuals, organ transplant recipients, and patients undergoing immunotherapy, particularly those with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts below 100 cells/&#956;l. This burgeoning prevalence burdens global health systems considerably [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of cryptococcosis and to develop innovative therapeutic strategies.</p><p>The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) constitutes the main mechanism for protein degradation within eukaryotic cells, playing a pivotal role in numerous biological functions essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. These functions include cellular signaling, growth regulation, cell cycle control, DNA replication, and transcription [<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The UPS operates as a multistage process encompassing the involvement of ubiquitin, three classes of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, proteasomes, and substrate proteins to mitigate the accumulation of damaged, misfolded, and aberrant proteins. Within this system, ubiquitin enzymes are subdivided into three categories: E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase), alongside 26S proteasomes and deubiquitylating enzymes. These components collaboratively orchestrate intracellular protein ubiquitination, significantly influencing cellular viability [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Ubiquitination modifications are integral to various cellular signaling pathways, necessitating precise substrate recognition predominantly mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligases. Currently, the most commonly studied E3 ubiquitin ligases are classified into four familial groups: U-box E3s, RBR E3s, HECT E3s, and RING E3s [<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The SCF (Skp1-cullin-F-box proteins) multisubunit complex is the most prevalent RING E3 ligase among these. This complex includes the scaffold protein cullin1, RING proteins RBX1 and RBX2, adaptor proteins, and substrate receptor proteins [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The SCF ubiquitin ligase utilizes F-box proteins to selectively recruit specific substrates for ubiquitination, which are then recognized and degraded by the proteasome [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the SCF-E3 ubiquitin ligase is instrumental in regulating various physiological processes at both cellular and organismal levels. Disruption of its functional integrity has been implicated in multiple pathologies, including neurogenic inflammation, cerebral ischemia, and various cancers [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16&#8211;18</xref>]. The high substrate specificity exhibited by the SCF ligase has garnered considerable interest among researchers in the field, highlighting its potential implications in therapeutic interventions.</p><p>F-box proteins, a distinct class of proteins characterized by the presence of the F-box domain, play a pivotal role in the recruitment of specific, modified substrates to SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) complexes. These proteins are integral to the ubiquitination process and subsequent degradation of target proteins across various cellular functions [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Predominantly found in eukaryotic organisms, F-box proteins exhibit a remarkable diversity in their functional roles, being implicated not only in neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and various cancers, including mechanisms of drug resistance, but also in critical biological processes related to fungal growth, sexual reproduction, and pathogenicity [<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21&#8211;23</xref>]. Extant research has highlighted the significance of F-box proteins such as MoCdc4, MoFwd1, and MoFbx15 in the growth, development, and pathogenic behavior of the plant pathogen <italic toggle="yes">Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>. MoFwd1&#160;has been identified as a modulator of the circadian rhythm within this organism, affecting the transcriptional and translational regulation of the MoFRQ protein [<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, the filamentous fungi-specific F-box protein, Frp1, as evidenced by the <italic toggle="yes">frp1</italic>&#916; mutant, which exhibits non-toxicity due to its failure to colonize plant roots, underscores the essential function of the <italic toggle="yes">FRP1</italic> gene in mediating pathogenicity [<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Recent investigations into <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> have demonstrated that the <italic toggle="yes">fbp1</italic>&#916; mutant of the F-box protein completely abrogates sexual reproduction and corresponding pathogenic traits [<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Importantly, studies reveal that heat-killed <italic toggle="yes">fbp1</italic>&#916; cells can elicit a Th1-type immune response, suggesting their potential application in vaccine development, particularly in the context of host exposure to various fungal pathogens [<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In <italic toggle="yes">Candida albicans</italic>, the F-box protein CaCdc4 is critical in hindering the transition from yeast to filamentous forms and modulating cell adhesion. This protein significantly affects the organism&#8217;s virulence and biofilm formation [<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. F-box proteins can also influence replication forks within challenging genomic regions and collaborate with the intra-S phase checkpoint protein Tof1 and the helicase Rrm3, thereby significantly contributing to the maintenance of genomic stability in <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> [<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Collectively, a comprehensive analysis of F-box proteins and identifying their downstream substrates is imperative for advancing our understanding of fungal virulence and developing effective strategies to control fungal infections.</p><p>In our earlier research, we identified the F-box protein Cdc4, which contains a potential F-box domain and eight WD40 repeats. This protein is essential for sexual reproduction and pathogenicity of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> and may also regulate cell membrane integrity and DNA damage repair [<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, we used isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomic analysis to comprehensively evaluate the downstream substrates associated with Cdc4. Through this analysis, we identified Rnh2B as a significant downstream target of Cdc4. Functional assays demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic> deletion significantly attenuated the pathogenicity of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>, while its overexpression completely abolished virulence. Host immune response analysis indicates that both the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain and the <italic toggle="yes">cdc4</italic>&#916; mutant induce comparable adaptive immune responses, promoting fungal clearance.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="s0002-s2001"><title>Ethics approval and ARRIVE guidelines statement</title><p>The animal studies conducted at Southwest University received approval from the Animal Ethics Committee of Southwest University (IACUC-20221022-14).

As essential constituents of the SCF-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex within this system, F-box proteins specifically recognize downstream substrates, thereby facilitating their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Previous investigations have elucidated the regulatory functions of F-box proteins concerning the pathogenicity of the human fungal pathogen <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which F-box proteins recognize and regulate the pathogenicity of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> through their substrates remain inadequately understood.</p><p>In this study, we have identified Ribonuclease H2 subunit B (Rnh2B) as a downstream substrate of the F-box protein Cdc4 through iTRAQ-based LC-MS proteomics analysis. Our yeast two-hybrid results provide preliminary support for the interaction between Cdc4 and Rnh2B (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(A)</xref>). Subsequent co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(B&#8211;D)</xref>) offer essential biochemical validation of this interaction. Our findings demonstrate that Rnh2B directly interacts with Cdc4, and the ubiquitination and degradation of Rnh2B are contingent upon the presence of Cdc4. Moreover, subcellular localization studies indicate that Rnh2B is predominantly localized in the nucleus of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>, and this nuclear localization remains largely unaffected by external stressors. Virulence assessments of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> demonstrate that the <italic toggle="yes">rnh2B</italic>&#916; mutant exhibits significantly diminished pathogenicity, whereas the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> overexpression strain exhibits a complete loss of virulence.

In <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Mus musculus</italic> model organisms, RNase H2 plays a critical role in removing ribonucleotides from genomic DNA and is essential for proper embryonic development in mice [<xref rid="cit0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Yeast strains deficient in RNase H2 demonstrate an increased ribonucleotide content, rendering them susceptible to low concentrations of methyl methanesulfonate (0.015% MMS) and hydroxyurea (25&#8201;mM HU) [<xref rid="cit0068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Notably, single mutations in the two non-catalytic subunits of RNase H2, RNH202 and RNH203, do not confer sensitivity to replication stress induced by 25&#8201;mM HU; in contrast, double mutants exhibit heightened sensitivity under similar conditions [<xref rid="cit0068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="cit0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].

Despite these findings, the role of RNase H2 in the pathogenicity of human fungal pathogens, such as <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Candida albicans</italic>, remains underexplored in current research.</p><p>Based on our preliminary findings, we first examined the role of Rnh2B in the development and formation of virulence factors in <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>. In comparative analyses with the wild-type H99 strain, the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain exhibited a pronounced reduction in growth at 37&#186;C. Prior research conducted by our group indicated that the <italic toggle="yes">cdc4</italic>&#916; mutant did not exhibit significant growth differences at 37&#186;C compared to the wild-type H99 strain [<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

Contrarily, the observations revealed that the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain exhibited a reduced growth rate at 37&#186;C, possibly due to the overexpression of the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic> gene. Therefore, further research is necessary to clarify how <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic> overexpression affects the growth of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> at 37&#186;C.</p><p>Subsequently, we investigated the pathogenicity of both the <italic toggle="yes">rnh2B</italic>&#916; mutant and the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain in greater detail. The results indicated that the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain exhibited a complete loss of pathogenicity when compared with the wild-type H99 strain (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), which aligns closely with our earlier observations, wherein the <italic toggle="yes">cdc4</italic>&#916; mutant strain also demonstrated a total loss of pathogenicity [<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This correlation suggests that Cdc4 May play a crucial role in modulating the pathogenicity of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> by regulating Rnh2B. The comparison between the wild-type strain H99 and the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain reveals intriguing insights into the mechanisms underlying virulence. The significant growth impairment observed in the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain at 37&#176;C suggests that temperature may play a crucial role in its pathogenicity. This raises important questions about how temperature sensitivity could be linked to the overall virulence of fungal strains. To delve deeper into this issue, we conducted infection experiments using <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> on <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> larvae at both 30&#176;C and 37&#176;C. The findings, illustrated in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(D)</xref>, highlight a marked reduction in pathogenicity for both the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain and the <italic toggle="yes">cdc4</italic>&#916; mutant strain at 30&#176;C compared to the H99 strain. This suggests that lower temperatures may contribute to diminished virulence; however, the temperature dependency does not fully explain the observed differences. Interestingly, at 37&#176;C, the results were striking. All larvae infected with the H99 strain succumbed by 6 dpi, while those infected with the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain and the <italic toggle="yes">cdc4</italic>&#916; mutant survived well beyond 15&#8201;days (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(D)</xref>). This significant discrepancy indicates that the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain&#8217;s reduced virulence stems from intrinsic defects rather than mere thermal sensitivity. Overall, the <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> infection model confirmed that this attenuated virulence was due to intrinsic defects in the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain rather than thermal sensitivity.</p><p>Macrophages function as the first line of defense against <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> invasion into the host&#8217;s airway and are pivotal determinants of the host&#8217;s infection outcome [<xref rid="cit0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="cit0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Consequently, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the complete loss of pathogenicity observed in the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain. Experiments involving mouse serum incubation and the interactions between <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> and macrophages revealed that both the <italic toggle="yes">cdc4</italic>&#916; strain and the <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> strain exhibited analogous phenotypes, characterized by significantly diminished survival rates in the host complement system and reduced proliferation capabilities within macrophages relative to the wild-type H99 strain (<xref rid="f0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).

The adaptive immune responses in mice infected with <italic toggle="yes">cdc4</italic>&#916; and <italic toggle="yes">RNH2B</italic><sup>OE</sup> were predominantly mediated by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the early infection phase (<xref rid="f0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>), corroborating previous studies that indicate the emergence of adaptive immunity, mainly via CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, as a critical factor when fungal pathogens penetrate pulmonary physical barriers and innate immune mechanisms [<xref rid="cit0074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="cit0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].
