CBT protocols emphasize the use of between-session homework assignments for practicing and solidifying skills acquired in therapy. Furthermore, practicing in &#8216;real-life settings&#8217; provides an opportunity to apply the new skills and ideally experience sustained symptom relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Homework in this context has been defined as &#8216;<italic toggle="yes">specific</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> structured</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> therapeutic activities that are routinely discussed in session</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> to be completed between sessions&#8217;</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. CBT therapists can assign many types of homework to patients. Broadly, these can be categorized as: 1) Psychoeducation, which often includes reading and educating oneself on the nature of one&#8217;s disorder; 2) self-assessment, e.g., mood monitoring, recognizing patterns in emotions, thoughts, and behaviors and their interconnectivity; and 3) modality-specific homework that pertains to the particular protocol and patient group, e.g., exposure-related homework for anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is hypothesized that engaging in homework assignments would lead to immediate symptom improvements in therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Homework engagement has been studied using <italic toggle="yes">quantity</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">quality</italic> as its indices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In this context, quantity refers to the amount of homework completed or partially completed, the amount of time involved, or the number of practice sessions undertaken to meet the homework assignment, whereas quality refers to the depth of engagement or acquired learning from homework assignments. Homework engagement can also be studied in terms of the patients&#8217; engagement with homework in general or patients&#8217; engagement with specific CBT assignments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Previous research has identified engagement in homework as an important factor in treatment outcomes and lack of engagement as an important predictor of CBT non-response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Studies comparing CBT protocols that include homework to those that do not have found larger effect sizes for the former [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, early homework engagement is associated with overall therapy engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Meta-analytic studies in samples of patients with mood disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] have consistently found both engagement in and the quality of homework to significantly predict patients&#8217; symptoms at the end of the intervention. The most recent meta-analysis by Kazantzis et al. (2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] found that both the quality and quantity of homework had a significant effect at the end of the treatment period (quality Hedges&#8217; g&#8201;=&#8201;0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]&#8201;=&#8201;0.03 to 1.53; quantity g&#8201;=&#8201;0.79, 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.57 to 1.02) and at follow-up (quality g&#8201;=&#8201;1.07, 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.06 to 2.08; quantity g&#8201;=&#8201;0.51, 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.28 to 0.74) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] across 17 studies on CBT (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;2,312 clients). In line with these findings, a systematic review on the impact of homework engagement in CBT for OCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] found a &#8220;consistent medium to large significant association between CBT task adherence and post-treatment OCD symptom reduction&#8221;.</p><p id="Par7">However, previous research on the importance of homework engagement has mainly relied on therapist-rated measures of overall engagement in homework post-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. One may question the reliability of therapists retrospectively accounting for homework engagement, i.e., therapists&#8217; estimates of it might become inflated as patients achieve more positive outcomes. Therefore, session-to-session ratings of engagement and symptom change may be a better way to understand the impact of homework on treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Several studies of this type exist. Yovel and Safren (2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] found no significant relationship between session-to-session homework engagement and symptom change among patients (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;16) in individual CBT for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Olatunji et al. (2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] found that homework engagement in individual CBT predicted symptom change in the following session for young adults (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;27) with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), while Strunk et al. (2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] reported that adherence to behavioral methods and homework in individual CBT predicted session-to-session symptom change among depression patients (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;60). Schmidt and Woolaway-Bickel (2000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] found that homework engagement in individual CBT was positively associated with a change in panic disorder symptoms (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;48). Conklin and Strunk (2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] showed that observer-rated homework engagement predicted session-to-session change in symptoms among patients (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;53) with depression receiving individual CBT. Finally, Yee et al. (2021) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] found no effect of homework engagement on the next session&#8217;s depression scores among patients with depression (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;50) in individual CBT.</p><p id="Par8">Furthermore, the effect of homework engagement on treatment outcomes has primarily been discussed for diagnosis-specific CBT (dCBT) protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the past decade, transdiagnostic CBT (tCBT) protocols have gained momentum due to their potential benefits for the simultaneous treatment of comorbid disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. tCBT interventions target underlying shared psychopathologies across related disorders and apply the same treatment principles without tailoring the interventions for specific symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) developed by David Barlow and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] is one of the best empirically supported tCBT protocols. The UP may even have advantages compared to dCBT protocols, since therapists can be trained to treat the full range of emotional disorders using a single treatment manual, and therapy groups can be formed in order of referral to the clinic instead of waiting for enough patients with the same diagnosis to start a group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A single study by Conklin et al. (2021) has investigated the effect of homework engagement on treatment outcomes across the UP and dCBT programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. They found that homework engagement and quality significantly predicted both self-reported and clinician-rated positive outcomes, but the effect on symptoms was not affected by treatment modality when comparing individual UP and individual dCBT for anxiety disorders and OCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The present study aimed to examine the impact of homework engagement on treatment outcomes in the UP and in direct comparison with dCBT protocols. Furthermore, it aimed to evaluate the the potential differences in the mediating/moderating effects of the homework across treatment type. In addition, while multiple researchers have examined the effect of CBT homework engagement in group therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], this study is the first to explore the impact of homework engagement on outcome in the context of UP group therapy. Lastly, we conducted a mediation analysis to explore whether treatment protocol affects symptom improvement and whether this association is mediated by homework engagement.</p><p id="Par10">We examined (a) patients&#8217; engagement in homework in dCBT and UP group treatments; (b) the impact of diagnosis and intervention on the quantity of homework engagement; and (c) the association between patients&#8217; engagement in homework assignments and symptom outcomes at end of therapy. We then isolated the unique effects of homework engagement on treatment outcomes using cross-lagged panel modeling (CLPM) to separate (d) between-persons and within-person effects and (e) effects from session to session. The within-person level allows for exploring the temporal changes in a potential effective characteristic of therapy relative to changes in treatment outcomes and is considered the appropriate level of analysis for understanding how psychological treatments assert their effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Based on Kazantzis et al.

There are five items per questionnaire, each of which is rated based on the past week and scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4.

The general effect of homework (HW) engagement on outcome was tested by adding the mean HW engagement across the full intervention period as a co-variate in the rmANOVA of HSCL-25 (baseline; end of treatment). We explored the effect of intervention arm and diagnostic category (depression or anxiety disorder) on mean homework engagement within three pre-defined periods of the psychotherapy course by including diagnostic category and intervention arm as co-factors in an rmANOVA of mean homework engagement score within the three periods (mean of beginning, middle and end period).

These were estimated using maximum likelihood with robust standard errors. Fit was compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The best-fitting model was further refined by testing whether loosening various constraints improved its fit. We started by allowing variation over time in (1) autoregressions, (2) cross-lagged regressions, and (3) slope loadings (i.e., allowing for non-linear trajectories). Residual variances were allowed to vary over time by default. We also tested whether adding second order auto- and cross-lagged regressions improved the model&#8217;s fit.</p><p id="Par25">To evaluate differences between groups regarding the effects of homework engagement, we tested both a mediation and a moderation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The meditation model postulated that homework engagement is better in one treatment than the other, and this difference affects symptom outcomes via cross-lagged paths. In contrast, the moderation model postulated that the effect of homework engagement on next-session symptom severity is stronger in one treatment compared to the other. Stated differently, in the moderation model, the cross-lagged effect itself is assumed to differ between the included treatments. As recommended in the literature, we estimated the indirect effect using bootstrapping to account for the non-normality of the product of coefficients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Results</title><p id="Par26">A total of 164 patients were included in the study.

Model fit was improved by allowing loadings for the slope factor for combined ODSIS/OASIS to be estimated freely (the first loading was constrained to zero and the last to 12, to identify the model, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]). Adding lag-2 autoregressions for both ODSIS/OASIS and homework engagement also improved fit. None of the other modifications did so. The final model (see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) showed good fit to the data according to fit indices, although the chi-square test was statistically significant (c<sup>2</sup>(364)&#8201;=&#8201;483.99, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001; RMSEA&#8201;=&#8201;0.04, 90% CI [0.03, 0.04]; CFI&#8201;=&#8201;0.96, SRMR&#8201;=&#8201;0.07). In Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, a cross-lagged panel model is estimated among the observed variables, while simultaneously accounting for between-patient differences in level (random intercept terms I<sub>Oi</sub> and I<sub>Hwi</sub>) and slope over time (random slope terms S<sub>Oi</sub> and S<sub>Hwi</sub>). Curved bidirectional arrows represent covariances, which are there to ensure the model is realistic and fits the data. Directed arrows represent either factor loadings (when going from random intercepts to observed variables); these are fixed to 1 for intercepts and to linear change (0, 1, 2, etc.) for slopes. Directed arrows between observed variables represent presumed causal effects on a within-patient level. The horizontal ones linking the same variable over time are called autoregression effects, while the diagonal ones between variables are called cross-lagged effects. The latter are the ones that are of most interest, as they indicate potential mechanisms of change.</p><p id="Par34">

The long-run effect of a stable one-point increase on the homework engagement rating would be expected to lead to 0.32 points of decrease in anxiety and depression symptoms, as assessed by the combined ODSIS/OASIS (se&#8201;=&#8201;0.15, z = -2.17, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.03, 95% CI [-0.61, &#8722;&#8201;0.03]).

We first tested a mediation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], in which the treatment group was added as a predictor of the random intercepts and slopes for homework engagement and combined ODSIS/OASIS, and observed variables at Time 1. The mediation model is visualized in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The direct effects of treatment group were statistically significant for the random intercepts and slopes of homework engagement (intercept coefficient&#8201;=&#8201;0.57, se&#8201;=&#8201;0.11, z&#8201;=&#8201;5.07, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001, slope coefficient&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;0.07, se&#8201;=&#8201;0.02, z = -4.48, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001), although not for the observed homework variable at session one (coefficient&#8201;=&#8201;0.25, se&#8201;=&#8201;0.17, z&#8201;=&#8201;1.43, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.15). Mimicking the findings from the summative analysis of homework engagement on treatment groups, this means that dCBT had significantly higher initial levels of homework engagement (at least from session two), but that the groups became more similar in terms of engagement over time (the negative effect of treatment group on slope coefficient). Since none of the direct effects of treatment type on combined ODSIS/OASIS were significant, we constrained these to zero and re-estimated the model. In this new model, we calculated the total indirect effect of treatment type on end-of-therapy outcome (combined ODSIS/OASIS, at session 14); however, it was likewise not statistically significant (indirect effect&#8201;=&#8201;0.05, se&#8201;=&#8201;0.05, z&#8201;=&#8201;1.04, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.30). Thus, the difference in homework engagement between treatments did not appear to have significantly influenced the overall outcome of the study.</p><p id="Par38">Second, we tested whether treatment moderated the effect of homework engagement on next-session ODSIS/OASIS scores using a two-group model. The results of this model indicated almost identical effects in the two groups (-0.21 vs. -0.23, difference = -0.03, se&#8201;=&#8201;0.21, z = -0.13, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.90).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par40">This study analyzed data on the patients&#8217; engagement in treatment homework and its impact on overall and session-to-session symptom outcomes in group CBT. We found that patients randomized to the UP had lower homework engagement in the first treatment period than those randomized to dCBT groups. This was especially true for those with a primary diagnosis of depression in the UP groups. The different content of the UP versus dCBT protocols might explain this finding. UP focuses on symptom monitoring, psychoeducation, clarity of emotion exercises, and mindfulness skills acquisition from session one through the rest of Period 1, while the dCBT protocol for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] instead prescribes problem and goal registration in session one and continues with registration of activities in the following sessions of this period (see Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref><bold>).</bold> It might be easier for participants with depression to engage in the activity-focused homework used in dCBT than in the clarity of emotion strategies and mindfulness exercises used in UP. Furthermore, the dCBT protocol for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] was developed for patients who received CBT in a day hospital&#8212;i.e., patients with a lower level of functioning compared to this study&#8217;s participants. It is possible that it was designed to include more accessible homework compared to the UP protocol, which was designed for outpatient administration. However, the result might also be explained by the therapists not sufficiently tailoring the treatment rationale and homework to participants with depression in the UP groups. Tailoring the assigned homework to the specific participant is also considered an important aspect of fostering homework compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This speculation is supported by qualitative data showing that therapists found the UP group protocol easier to apply for participants with anxiety disorders than participants with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. A possible clinical implication of the current finding is that UP therapists should pay extra attention to homework completion for patients with depression and tailor the homework to these participants.</p><p id="Par41">Although we found homework engagement to be lower in UP, this did not affect the outcome of treatment when examined with linear regression or cross-lagged panel modeling, nor across outcomes. This also reflects the findings of the main trial, which showed non-inferiority between UP and dCBT regarding symptom outcomes, functioning, and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">For this paper, we utilized the HSCL-25 as an outcome for the first analyses, since it included items relating to both anxiety and depression and was therefore useful for capturing therapy outcome in a transdiagnostic sample. The main study employed the six-item Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Rating scales for diagnostic-specific outcomes, but we did not use these outcomes, as we did not have sufficient statistical power to analyze the level of diagnosis or for specific dCBT protocols.</p><p id="Par43">For the second analysis (cross-lagged panel modeling), we used a combined ODSIS/OASIS score, since these short symptom outcome measures were administered at each session as an integrated part of the UP protocol, and in the main study, they were collected in both intervention arms. The broad transdiagnostic outcome measures applied in both types of analyses may have diluted the effects of homework engagement. Yet, we did find an overall effect of mean homework engagement on the symptom outcomes at the end of therapy, as well as a significant, but small, effect of homework engagement on the next-session combined OASIS/ODSIS measure scores in the cross-lagged panel modeling analysis. This corresponds to previous meta-analytic findings in other samples of patients with mood disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], where homework engagement significantly predicted the patients&#8217; symptoms at the end of the intervention.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par44">The homework engagement measure applied herein was purpose-made for the present study by the authors and has, therefore, not been tested in other studies or undergone formal validation. Relying on a single item, it captures the quantity aspect of general homework engagement measured as time spent on homework assignments. However, it does not capture other aspects of homework engagement quantity, including the number of homework tasks worked with or the amount of homework partially or fully completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, the first response option on the homework engagement measure was phrased as, &#8220;I have not thought about the homework and did not work on it/I did not want to work on it.&#8221; This might combine two rather distinct aspects: intention or ability to perform the homework assignments versus motivation or engagement in the homework and/or the group therapy.</p><p id="Par45">Furthermore, we did not assess the quality of patients&#8217; homework engagement, but only to what degree it had been attempted or done. It is plausible that the quality of the completed homework, rather than simply the attempt at or engagement in performing it, is the true predictor of the outcome. In Kazantzis et al.&#8217;s (2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] meta-analysis, they found that both the quality and quantity of homework engagement predicted treatment outcomes in CBT programs. However, quality might be more relevant than quantity, since it is more closely related to the treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Previous research suggests that the quality of homework in CBT is a possible mediator of the effect on symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, we did not assess how patients engaged in different types of homework assignments <italic toggle="yes">specific</italic> to the treatment. A previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] found that both general homework engagement and engagement in specific CBT homework assignments affected the treatment outcomes.</p><p id="Par46">In addition to this, homework engagement was self-reported, which can be regarded as a limitation of the study. Although self-reporting is a widely used source of engagement data, it may overestimate the extent of homework completed relative to objective measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Further, Kazantzis et al. (2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] found that the assessment of homework is highly heterogeneous across individual studies. The 17 studies included in their meta-analysis all tracked homework engagement. Ten studies tracked homework engagement and quality with a single-item Likert-type instrument, while the remaining seven trials tracked whether homework was completed. In most studies, engagement was self-reported, while in the remaining studies it was assessed by the therapist or research staff. Only three studies utilized established instruments&#8212;the Homework Compliance Scale (HCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and Patient EX/RP Adherence Scale (PEAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]&#8212;to track homework engagement, while the remainder of the instruments used were purpose-made for their trials. The PEAS was the only multi-item instrument, having three items.</p><p id="Par48">We also analyzed the ODSIS and OASIS scores as one combined score rather than conducting separate analyses of the two instruments. We did so inspired by previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] where other brief anxiety and depression scales have been combined yielding valid and sensitive composite measures of anxiety and depression. We furthermore wished to preserve the primary trial&#8217;s transdiagnostic perspective, albeit we realize that the composite ODSIS/OASIS measure has not been validated. This method is in line with a transdiagnostic perspective where anxiety and depression symptoms should be considered manifestations of a shared underlying neuroticism/negative affect construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. However, it is possible that analyzing the two instruments separately would have yielded different results, and that our methods obscure possible symptom-specific effects of HW.</p><p id="Par49">Finally, while the present study focused on the role of homework engagement in the outcome of group CBT interventions, it should be noted that other psychotherapy process variables such as client factors, group cohesion, working alliance, and patients&#8217; beliefs about homework can also impact outcome and therapy and explain lack of significance, as found by McEvoy et al. (2024a) and McEvoy et al. (2024b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Furthermore, therapist protocol adherence and therapist competence may indirectly promote engagement to homework, but may also influence outcomes via other routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. It is, therefore, possible that our findings reflect the effects of HW being &#8220;drowned out&#8221; by other important factors known to influence group therapy (e.g., group coherence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on homework&#8217;s effects on treatment outcomes in UP, and the first ever in group UP. Since this study used robust CLPM to account for the effect of homework engagement on symptom outcomes, our findings may reflect the isolated effects of homework on treatment outcomes and overcome methodological shortcomings in the area. Thus, they may reflect the actual effects of homework engagement rather than being explained by the previously proposed methodological issues. Future research should use an established and validated measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] such as the Homework Compliance Scale (HCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] to track homework engagement. Future research could also incorporate general and specific factors known to affect the outcome of group therapy.</p><p id="Par51">Lastly, it has been speculated that homework assignment could worsen symptoms for some patients. Barnes et al.&#8217;s (2013) qualitative research on homework in CBT for depression found that, for a substantial number of patients, homework may become an insurmountable burden that leads to feelings of failure and, hence, may intensify depressive experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Therefore, patients&#8217; feelings about homework must be monitored, and obstacles to engagement must be discussed continuously in therapy. This might be more difficult in group therapy, which allows less focus on individual challenges and where the therapist possibly has less insight into each patient. Nevertheless, future research should investigate the possible negative effects of homework in CBT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par52">This study examined the relationships between engagement in homework, symptoms, and different types of group CBT. We found lower homework engagement among patients with depression randomized to UP, but this had no impact on the patients&#8217; overall symptom outcomes at the end of therapy. However, across CBT protocols, homework engagement had a small effect on end-of-treatment outcomes as well as on the next week&#8217;s ratings of anxiety and depression. This is the first study to examine homework engagement&#8217;s effects on symptoms in group UP and adds to the limited literature using robust methods to isolate treatment engagement&#8217;s unique influences on symptom outcomes. Future studies should confirm the results and include other relevant aspects of homework, such as homework quality, and other process variables, such as therapist factors, group cohesion, and negative effects of homework assignment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>SA, MA, MH, SP, BB, and NR conceived the project.
