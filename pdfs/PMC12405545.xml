In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while specific A-to-I editing events have been identified, their functional mechanisms and clinical relevance remain poorly understood. Here, through whole-transcriptome analysis of NSCLC specimens, we discovered a hyper-editing event at position c.1746 in the long non-coding RNA SNHG3 (c.1746&#8201;A&#8201;&gt;&#8201;I), which correlates with advanced metastatic stages and reduced patient survival. Functional studies demonstrated that edited SNHG3 (SNHG3<sup>ED</sup>) exhibits significantly greater pro-metastatic activity compared to its wild-type counterpart (SNHG3<sup>WT</sup>). Mechanistically, SNHG3<sup>ED</sup> shows enhanced binding affinity for the chromatin remodeler SSRP1, triggering SSRP1-mediated replication origin assembly and subsequent upregulation of fatty acid metabolism and ferroptosis-related genes. This molecular rewiring promotes fatty acid oxidation, confers resistance to ferroptosis, and importantly, drives docetaxel (DTX) chemoresistance. In DTX-resistant NSCLC cell lines, patient-derived organoids, and Nude mouse xenograft tumor model, antisense oligonucleotide-based targeting of SNHG3<sup>ED</sup> effectively restored DTX sensitivity and suppressed tumor growth. Our findings demonstrate that SNHG3 c.1746&#8201;A&#8201;&gt;&#8201;I editing serves both as a novel prognostic biomarker for NSCLC and as a mechanistically defined therapeutic target to overcome DTX resistance, which offers a potential therapeutic target to improve DTX efficacy.</p><p id="Par2">

Despite considerable advancements in elucidating the critical molecular mechanisms governing cancer metastasis, relatively few molecules have been successfully targeted to enhance patient survival outcomes. A potential reason for this limitation is that pivotal regulators of metastasis are frequently associated with aberrant gene expression or mutations. The identification of novel key regulators of metastasis and the innovation of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at these regulators could substantially improve survival rates among cancer patients.</p><p id="Par5">RNA editing, particularly adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing, represents over 70% of human RNA editing events and is emerging as a significant cancer hallmark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

However, their effects on cancer progression are largely unknown.

Three sites were both metastasis- and survival-related (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), with our focus on an A-to-I editing site in <italic toggle="yes">SNHG3</italic> for several reasons: the site is situated in the 3&#8217;-untranslated region (3&#8217;-UTR) of <italic toggle="yes">SNHG3</italic>, distinguishing it from other sites in gene introns or intergenic regions. <italic toggle="yes">SNHG3</italic> is a recognized oncogenic long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in various cancers, especially NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Notably, this editing site is uniquely associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC among 12 cancer types analyzed in the TCGA dataset (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Multivariable Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, and tumor purity (ESTIMATE score) confirmed the independent prognostic value (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.032).

The cells were subsequently cultured for one week to ensure recovery and adaptation before being subjected to the next concentration in the gradient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides synthesis and treatment</title><p id="Par52">Two ASOs targeting SNHG3<sup>WT</sup> with thymine (i.e., ASO<sup>T</sup>) and two ASOs targeting SNHG3<sup>ED</sup> with cytosine (i.e., ASO<sup>C</sup>) at the editing site were designed and synthesized by RiboBio Co., Ltd. A scrambled ASO was purchased from the same company and utilized as a negative control (ASO<sup>NC</sup>). The ASO<sup>C2</sup> was further LNA modified at the first and last three nucleotides. The LNA-ASOs were transfected into the A549DR at a concentration of 25 or 50&#8201;nM using GP-transfect-Mate (GenePharma, China). After 24&#8201;hours, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing varying concentrations of DTX for 72&#8201;h. Cell viability was then test using the CCK8 assay. Additionally, following a three-day co-incubation of the ASO with PDOs, the culture medium was replaced either with fresh medium containing 50&#8201;nM DTX or without the drug, while maintaining the ASO at the same concentration. After an additional three-day incubation period, cell viability was assessed using the Cell Counting-Lite 3D Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Vazyme, Nanjing, China), according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Briefly, organoids were digested and seeded into 96-well plates, and then left at RT for 30&#8201;minutes. An equal volume of CellCounting-Lite 3D was added, followed by vigorous shaking for 5&#8201;minutes to ensure complete cell lysis. The plates were incubated at 25&#8201;&#176;C for 25&#8201;minutes, after which fluorescence intensity was measured. ASO treatment of the xenograft tumor was initiated after the tumor volume reached 0.5&#8201;cm<sup>3</sup>. Mice were injected with 6 nmol LNA-ASO<sup>C2</sup> or control-ASO in the absence or presence of DTX (2&#8201;mg/kg) through intratumoral injection, every 3 days for up to 28 days without any delivery system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p id="Par53">We identified clinically relevant A-to-I editing events by integrating multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). First, clinical records for NSCLC patients, including demographic information and survival outcomes, were obtained from the TCGA Data Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/</ext-link>). Corresponding A-to-I RNA editing profiles were acquired from the Synapse database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2374375/files/">https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2374375/files/</ext-link>), which contains genome-wide editing levels derived from TCGA RNA-seq data. Tumor purity was quantified using ESTIMATE algorithm-derived scores obtained through the ESTIMATE web portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/estimate/index.html">https://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/estimate/index.html</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Through systematic matching of unique TCGA barcodes, we performed an exact inner join operation to integrate these datasets while implementing stringent quality control measures, including editing site coverage validation and cross-examination of unmatched samples. To assess prognostic significance, we performed Cox proportional hazards regression for each editing site. Metastasis-associated editing events were identified by comparing the correlation between editing levels of each site and nude metastasis stages, using the Spearman rank correlation test. All analyses were conducted in R 4.3.3 with stringent quality control, and reproducible code has been deposited in the Zenodo repository (10.5281/zenodo.15621261).</p><p id="Par54">TCGA RNA-seq data were employed to analyze the correlations between gene expression levels and c.1746&#8201;A&#8201;&gt;&#8201;I editing levels, as well as the correlations among target genes. The transcriptomic data for all lung cancer patients available through TCGA were systematically retrieved from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/</ext-link>). The dataset was obtained by first filtering for primary lung cancer cases (TCGA-LUAD and TCGA-LUSC projects), then selecting all available RNA sequencing data under the &#8220;Transcriptome Profiling&#8221; category with &#8220;Gene Expression Quantification&#8221; as the data type. Specifically, we acquired the HTSeq normalized count data (workflow type: HTSeq - Counts) to ensure consistency across samples. The complete dataset was downloaded programmatically using the GDC Data Transfer Tool with an authenticated manifest file approach. Metadata files in JSON format were simultaneously obtained to maintain sample annotations and clinical correlations. All data handling and preprocessing were performed in accordance with TCGA&#8217;s data use policies and ethical guidelines for secondary analysis of de-identified patient data.</p><p id="Par55">To investigate potential associations between SNHG3 editing and drug sensitivity, we integrated pharmacological and molecular data by retrieving IC50 values of anti-cancer agents from the GDSC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancerrxgene.org/">https://www.cancerrxgene.org/</ext-link>) and corresponding SNHG3 expression profiles from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.broadinstitute.org/ccle/">CCLE</ext-link>, with data merging performed through exact matching of cell line names.

The sample sizes were determined based on power calculations for survival analysis, using hazard ratios (HR) derived from TCGA data as effect size estimates. Assuming 80% power at a 5% significance level (two-sided), the minimum required sample size was calculated to detect the expected HR difference between groups using standard survival analysis sample size formulas. The numbers of biological replicates, repetitions of the experiments, and statistical significance are listed in the figure legends. The linear regression and Cox regression were used to analyze the associations of A-to-I editing profiles with lymph node metastasis and overall survival, respectively. The unpaired t-test with Welch&#8217;s correction or the paired t-test was used to test differences in two groups. The one-way ANOVA was used to test differences in more than two groups with one independent factor, and the two-way ANOVA was applied for analyzing differences in two or more groups with two independent variables. Tukey multiple comparisons test was used for pairwise comparison between groups. The association analysis between two numerical variables, such as editing levels and gene expression levels, was conducted using Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation test.
