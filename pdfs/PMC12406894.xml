However, there is limited information on how best to select these patients for efficient use of resources. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of team-based care for patients with HF after discharge from hospital according to duration of intervention and stratification of patients according to risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We retrospectively identified 185 eligible patients who were hospitalised with acute decompensated HF at our institution between January 2021 and June 2023. Multidisciplinary team care was defined as outpatient follow-up by both cardiologists and nurses postdischarge. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular-related death and readmission with HF within 1 year, which was compared between patients receiving HF team care and those receiving standard follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>HF team care was provided for 53.0% of patients, who were younger than those receiving standard follow-up and required more oral inotropes, tolvaptan and amiodarone. Among those receiving HF team care, the majority (58.2%) had an intervention duration of 30 days or less after discharge. After adjusting for background differences by inverse probability of treatment weighting, HF team care was associated with favourable 180-day outcomes, but there was no significant between-group difference in the 1-year primary outcomes. In subgroup analysis, patients with a higher Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure score (&#8805;28), indicating a higher risk of exacerbation of HF, had significantly lower 1-year event rates with HF team care (p value for interaction &lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Multidisciplinary HF team care is most effective for patients at higher risk of exacerbation of HF.

The study is an exploratory study and does not calculate the number of case settings.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Care provided by the HF team</title><p>Tottori University Hospital is a tertiary care facility located in a rural area of Japan.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> It provides specialist treatment for HF, including left ventricular assist device. This hospital provides follow-up care for patients hospitalised with worsening HF after discharge through a collaborative approach between cardiologists and nurses.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Nurses provide guidance on self-care and ongoing support for patients and their families and coordinate with local nursing and care services.</p><p>The nursing follow-up team consists of three to four nurses (including one certified chronic HF nurse), all of whom have experience working in cardiovascular wards. At the time of discharge, the ward nurses hand over patient care to outpatient nurses, and interventions are carried out in accordance with a transition programme developed by our hospital, as previously described.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13 14</sup></xref> Briefly, patients use a personal handbook to record blood pressure, body weight, dyspnoea and the presence of oedema, and they are instructed to contact their healthcare provider if they experience short-term weight gain or worsening dyspnoea or oedema. Educational content is standardised using video-based materials. In addition, an HF care plan sheet is used to standardise individualised education and support and to ensure seamless sharing of the care plan from inpatient care to outpatient follow-up. These core elements apply to all patients, irrespective of their Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC) risk category. As a general rule, an outpatient nurse conducts a consultation with each patient during the intervals between a physician&#8217;s examinations. Continuation of outpatient care is determined by the nurse, taking into account the patient and family&#8217;s level of understanding of self-care.</p><p>Decisions on whether patients receive follow-up care at Tottori University Hospital or at a non-specialised regional facility are made by the attending physician and the HF team during hospitalisation. If a patient has a history of attending a primary care clinic before hospitalisation, follow-up care is generally entrusted to that clinic on discharge. However, if the attending physician determines that continued follow-up at the hospital is necessary, coordination between the primary care clinic and the hospital ensures appropriate management. Regardless of the follow-up location, it is generally agreed that all patients should start follow-up care within 2 weeks after discharge.</p><p><xref rid="SF1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Online supplemental figure 1</xref> shows the follow-up care provided for patients hospitalised with HF during the study period. 80 patients continued care for HF at the hospital, while 105 were referred elsewhere. Within the hospital group, 11&#8201;patients received care solely from cardiologists and 69 received care from both cardiologists and nurses (ie, &#8216;HF team care&#8217;). Typically, patients followed up in our outpatient clinic receive HF team care. However, the appointments for the above-mentioned 11&#8201;patients were overlooked by the nursing staff, resulting in follow-up being conducted solely by physicians. 29 of the referred patients received collaborative follow-up from cardiologists, nurses and primary care physicians, while 76 were managed by primary care physicians alone. HF team care was defined as joint outpatient care, including collaborative follow-up, provided by cardiologists and nurses. Standard care consisted of management solely by physicians without interdisciplinary involvement.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Data collection</title><p>We collected data on patient demographics, medical history, comorbidities, laboratory tests, echocardiograms and discharge medications. The MAGGIC risk score, which prognosticates based on 13 variables from a previous study, was calculated.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> These variables include age, sex, left ventricular ejection fraction, systolic blood pressure, creatinine, body mass index, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, smoking status, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of HF and medication status. The original risk score assigns 2 points if the patient has a history of HF for 18 months or longer. However, due to the retrospective nature of this study, it was not possible to collect a detailed HF history. Therefore, we allocated 2 points to patients with a history of hospitalisation for HF, as in a previous study.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> It was also difficult to distinguish between NYHA functional class I and class II at discharge because the patients had restricted activities during hospitalisation. Therefore, for calculation purposes, classes I and II were classified as class II.</p><p>The patients were followed up 1 year after discharge from hospital using medical records and telephone interviews. The physicians who performed this follow-up could be cardiologists or non-cardiologists. Patients who were followed up primarily by other clinics but attended our hospital regularly were considered to have received collaborative follow-up.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The primary outcomes of interest were cardiovascular-related death and unplanned rehospitalisation for HF. Cardiovascular-related death was defined as death from HF, sudden death and vascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke or other vascular diseases).</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the ethical guidelines for epidemiological studies issued by Japan&#8217;s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. We disseminated the research information publicly and, in accordance with our ethical guidelines, proceeded with data analysis without explicitly obtaining informed consent, allowing patients the opportunity to opt out.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Continuous variables are expressed as the median (IQR) and were compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables are shown as the count (percentage) and were compared between groups using Fisher&#8217;s exact test. Cumulative event rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and tested with the log-rank test. To examine the effect of duration of intervention on the event rate, we performed a landmark analysis and evaluated the outcomes for the period of 0&#8211;180&#8201;days and 180&#8211;365&#8201;days. The association between HF team care and outcomes, including subgroup interactions, was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis was used to adjust for the prognostic impact of differences in patient background characteristics between the HF team care group and the standard care group. This method involves calculating propensity scores based on patient characteristics and applying inverse probability weights to balance covariates between the groups, thereby simulating a randomised trial effect. Age, sex and patient background characteristics that tended to vary between the two groups (p&lt;0.1), including systolic blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes, and use of beta blockers, loop diuretics, tolvaptan, amiodarone and oral inotropes, were included in the analytical model to minimise confounding and improve the robustness of the outcome assessment. The relationship between the MAGGIC risk score and outcomes was illustrated using a predictive curve derived from spline analysis. The optimal cut-off value for predicting events using the MAGGIC risk score was determined by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. All analyses were performed using R V.4.1.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and EZR (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan), a graphical user interface for R. A p value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p><xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the baseline characteristics of patients in the HF team care group and those in the standard care group. The median patient age was 77 years (IQR 69, 84), 63.8% were male, 34.1% had ischaemic heart disease and the median MAGGIC score was 26 points (IQR 21, 30). After discharge, 53.0% of patients received HF team care. Patients in the HF team care group were younger than those in the standard care group, had significantly fewer comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes, and had significantly lower blood pressure at discharge. In terms of prescribed medications at discharge, the amiodarone prescription rate was significantly higher in the HF team care group than in the standard care group. Prescriptions for beta blockers, tolvaptan and oral inotropes also tended to be more common in the HF team care group. Conversely, loop diuretics were prescribed less frequently in the HF team care group. There was no significant between-group difference in blood test results at discharge or use of care services postdischarge.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1" orientation="portrait"><label>Table

Cardiovascular-related mortality was 4.6% in the standard care group and 5.1% in the HF team care group, with respective HF-related readmission rates of 16.1% and 10.2%. In terms of the composite outcome, which included both cardiovascular-related death and readmission for HF, the event rates were 14.3% in the HF team care group and 19.5% in the standard care group. The between-group difference was not statistically significant despite adjustments for differences in patient background characteristics. However, comparison of the curves for the two groups revealed a widening of the difference up to 180 days that gradually narrowed thereafter. This trend was investigated further by landmark analysis. The results showed that the incidence of cardiovascular events during the first 180 days was significantly lower in the HF team care group than in the standard care group (p&lt;0.05, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>). However, there was no significant between-group difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events between 180 and 365 days, although there was a slight increase in incidence in the HF team care group during this time (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>).

ROC curve analysis identified a MAGGIC risk score of &#8805;28 points as the cut-off value for predicting cardiovascular events.

There was a significant interaction between HF team care and cardiovascular events based on a MAGGIC risk score cut-off of 28 points. The relationship between HF team care and a reduced risk of cardiovascular events was significantly stronger among patients with a score of &#8805;28 points than among those with a score of &lt;28 points. Furthermore, the incidence of cardiovascular events was significantly lower among patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of &#8805;50%&#8201;and those hospitalised with HF for the first time, when HF team care was provided rather than standard care (p&lt;0.05). However, these interactions did not reach statistical significance (p&lt;0.1). The beneficial effect of HF team care on the risk of cardiovascular events remained consistent regardless of the follow-up institution or the specialisation of the attending physician.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrated that team-based intervention involving collaboration between cardiologists and nurses is particularly effective after hospitalisation for HF in patients identified as high risk based on an objective risk score. The risk-reducing effect of this team intervention was consistently observed during follow-up at specialist facilities and in coordination with local primary care clinics, regardless of the attending physician&#8217;s specialty. These findings suggest that regional collaboration using an objective risk score may be a promising approach for optimising the management of HF when healthcare resources are limited.</p><p>Postdischarge follow-up for patients hospitalised with worsening HF using risk stratification has yet to be optimised. Previous research could not demonstrate the effectiveness of team-based interventions when risk was stratified using N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Using a more comprehensive risk scoring system may offer potential benefits. The COACH study showed that applying objective risk scores to stratify patients with HF presenting to the emergency department and delivering optimal care based on these scores improved patient outcomes.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> However, the value of this approach in the postdischarge setting remains uncertain. The MAGGIC risk score used in this study has been validated both domestically and internationally and serves as a widely applicable metric.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Our results indicate that while the risk of cardiovascular events increased with increasing MAGIC scores in both the HF team care group and the standard care group, the intervention had a greater risk-reducing effect among high-risk patients. This interaction underscores the value of intensive HF care guided by objective risk stratification.</p><p>This study also examined the relationship between duration of intervention postdischarge and occurrence of cardiovascular events. While the duration of intervention has varied widely in previous studies, ranging from just a few weeks to as long as 1 year,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> our protocol focused primarily on the first 30 days postdischarge. Even short-term interventions effectively reduced the risk of events within the first 180 days, which is the most vulnerable phase. However, beyond 180 days, a trend of increased events was observed in the intervention group. Because the majority of the intervention concluded within 180 days, attenuation of the educational effect as the intervention faded (ie, memory decay)<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> and a decline in self-management adherence are plausible. A booster education session at 6 months could be implementation strategies to prevent a rebound in risk.</p><p>The absolute event risk was low in our low-risk patients, suggesting a limited impact of team-based interventions in this group. In such cases, follow-up at non-specialist facilities may be a reasonable option. A previous study found no significant difference in long-term outcomes between follow-up that included team-based care and follow-up by a primary care physician in low-risk patients.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> However, these findings should not be interpreted as &#8216;low risk=no close follow-up&#8217;. Even among low-risk patients, optimisation of guideline-directed medical therapy, timely postdischarge review and reinforcement of self-care education remain essential. Our study was conducted in a region with an integrated HF care programme linking hospitals and primary care physicians, which may have contributed to lower event rates even when follow-up occurred outside specialist facilities.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9 14</sup></xref></p><p>Although not statistically significant, a slight increase in events was observed among low-risk patients in the intervention group. Prescriptions for oral inotropes, amiodarone and tolvaptan were more frequent in the HF team care group, which suggests that these patients had more severe HF and were at higher risk of cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmia irrespective of low-risk score. Although background factors were adjusted for, some higher risk patient characteristics remained in this group, potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Furthermore, the original MAGGIC risk score was designed to predict the risk of mortality,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and it has been reported that the MAGGIC risk score is less able to predict HF-related hospitalisations.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> In this study, most cardiovascular events involved HF-related hospitalisation, suggesting that the risk score may underestimate the risk of hospitalisation in patients with severe HF. This highlights the need for careful assessment and appropriate intervention, even for patients classified as low risk.</p><p>This study has several limitations. Its retrospective observational and non-randomised design meant that there was selection bias in assigning patients to the intervention and standard care groups, which led to differences in patient background characteristics. The HF team care group received more prescriptions for medications targeting cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmia. However, this group also included patients with mild fluid retention who did not require loop diuretics on discharge, highlighting the diversity in patient characteristics. Although IPTW analysis was used to adjust for patient background factors, we cannot exclude the possibility that there were still some unadjusted confounders. Furthermore, differences in healthcare systems and regional factors require careful consideration in terms of the generalisability of our findings. Nevertheless, despite being observational, this study provides valuable insights into risk score utilisation and effective allocation of healthcare resources, and its results highlight the need for further research.</p><p>In conclusion, discharge triage based on the MAGGIC score is useful to prioritise allocation of limited specialist resources for high-risk patients. As the impact of immediate postdischarge education attenuates by 6&#8201;months, continuity of care is essential. Further studies are needed to prospectively validate a two-stage strategy that combines this triage with a booster intervention at approximately 180 days.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SF1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/openhrt-2025-003496</object-id><label>online supplemental figure 1</label><media xlink:href="openhrt-12-2-s001.pdf" id="d67e832" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SF2" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/openhrt-2025-003496</object-id><label>online supplemental figure 2</label><media xlink:href="openhrt-12-2-s002.pdf" id="d67e837" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SF3" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/openhrt-2025-003496</object-id><label>online supplemental figure 3</label><media xlink:href="openhrt-12-2-s003.pdf" id="d67e842" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the support of Genspark in generating the visual representations used in this report.
