However, the excavation characteristics of the left and right tunnels are easy to cause structural disturbance and deformation out of control. In particular, the surrounding rock disturbance of the front tunnel caused by the construction of the secondary tunnel often leads to lining cracking and structural instability. Based on the Xinmajie Tunnel project in China, combined with similar model experiments and finite element simulation, the structural mechanical response and failure evolution characteristics during the construction process were systematically studied, and the influence of the excavation of the secondary tunnel on the stress mechanism of the front tunnel was mainly revealed. On this basis, a comparative study was further carried out on the influence of different excavation methods, excavation footage and tunnel face offset parameters about the structural stress. The results show that the deformation of the surrounding rock experiences three stages of &#8220;rapid increase&#8210;rapid decrease&#8210;slow increase&#8221;, and the disturbance of the secondary tunnel makes the maximum settlement of the front tunnel arch crown increase by 25.56%. The axial force and bending moment of the right arch waist lining of the front tunnel are the largest, and the stress concentration phenomenon is prominent, which is the most unfavorable part of the force. During the loading process, the cracks of the lining structure are concentrated in the weak areas such as arch shoulder, arch crown and inverted arch. In addition, the excavation method of the middle partition wall (first left and then right) and the control of small excavation footage are helpful to weaken the disturbance, and alleviate the stress concentration. The 12&#160;m staggered distance of the left and right tunnel faces is the best in controlling the settlement and plastic zone expansion. It is recommended as an important parameter reference for similar tunnel layout.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Double-arch tunnel</kwd><kwd>Without middle drift</kwd><kwd>Model experiment</kwd><kwd>Numerical simulation</kwd><kwd>Lining cracking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Engineering</kwd><kwd>Solid Earth sciences</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Science and Technology Innovation Project of YCIC Group Co., Ltd.</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. YCIC-YF-2022-08</award-id><award-id>No. YCIC-YF-2022-08</award-id><award-id>No. YCIC-YF-2022-08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Junwu</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Anmin</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Science and Technology Innovation Project of Yunnan Jiaotou Group Yunling Construction Co., Ltd.</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. YLJS-KF-2024-06</award-id><award-id>No. YLJS-KF-2024-06</award-id><award-id>No. YLJS-KF-2024-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Junwu</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Anmin</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the National Natural Science Fund of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. 52078090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the General Project of Chongqing Jiaotong University Entrepreneurship Fund in 2024</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. CY202409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Song</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">With the rapid advancement of transportation infrastructure construction, large-span tunnel projects under complex geological conditions have emerged in large numbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Double-arch tunnels have been widely used in the large-span structural system due to its advantages of high space utilization and flexible line selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, due to the setting of the middle drift tunnel, traditional double -arch tunnels not only have complicated construction technology and prolonged period, but also easily causes leakage and structural diseases, which seriously affects the service safety and durability of the structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">To improve the above problems, in recent years, China has explored and applied a new structural form of double-arch tunnels without middle drift in some mountain highway projects. The structure cancels the middle partition wall, and connects the steel arch of the secondary tunnel&#8217;s primary support to that of the front tunnel via lapping, enabling both tunnels to share part of the initial support system, and the support of the secondary tunnel is not independent into a ring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This structure effectively simplifies construction procedures, reduces costs, and improves adaptability to complex terrain, showing strong potential for broader application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">However, since this type of tunnel is still in the early stage of engineering practice, the relevant design experience and theoretical basis are limited, and there is a lack of unified design standards and industry guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, the characteristics of zero-distance approaching construction make the front tunnel bear the additional load and disturbance induced by the excavation of the secondary tunnel after the lining is stable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Consequently, the deformation behavior of the surrounding rock and the structural response mechanisms differ significantly from those of conventional double-arch tunnels, making direct application of existing research findings inadequate.</p><p id="Par5">At present, scholars have conducted systematic research on the evolution of surrounding rock pressure, load calculation methods, middle partition wall stability and lining failure of traditional double-arch tunnel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. For instance, Sun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> developed a load calculation method for surrounding rock in deep-buried double-arch tunnels based on the Protodyakonov pressure arch theory and staged loading model. Similarly, Min et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> revealed the evolution path and failure mode of lining cracks under asymmetric structure conditions by combining model test and numerical analysis. However, these results are mostly aimed at traditional structures with a middle drift, and their applicability to the structure without the middle drift remains to be further verified.</p><p id="Par6">With the advancement of the engineering practice for double-arch tunnel without middle drift, some scholars have begun to explore mechanical behavior and design methodologies. Tang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and Bi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> established the load calculation model of double-arch tunnel without middle drift based on limit equilibrium and complex variable function theory, respectively. Lu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> utilized FLAC3D to simulate the structural response under different excavation methods. Jiang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> studied the dynamic disturbance characteristics under blasting construction conditions based on LS-DYNA software. These studies have expanded the understanding, but there are still some problems, such as the difficulty of special-shaped contact simulation, the insufficient accuracy of structural node modeling and the limited computational efficiency. Therefore, the reliability of their findings requires further validation through physical experiments.</p><p id="Par7">In contrast, physical model tests have been widely used in the study of deformation and failure mechanism of long-span tunnels, as they can truly reflect the interaction between structure and surrounding rock and avoid the problem of meshing and parameter idealization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, due to the complex structure of the tunnel, the long period of model making, and the difficulty of building the experimental system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>systematic physical model studies on this tunnel type are still scarce. Therefore, it is of great significance to improve the design theory and guide the engineering practice to carry out the physical model test research on the double-arch tunnel without middle drift, and to systematically reveal the structural response mechanism and key risk parts in the construction process.</p><p id="Par8">In this context, based on the Xinmajie Tunnel project in Yunnan Province, China, through large-scale indoor model test and finite element numerical simulation method, this paper reveals the structural mechanical response and instability failure characteristics during the construction of the double-arch tunnel without middle drift, and focuses on the analysis of the stress evolution laws of the front tunnel structure during the excavation of the secondary tunnel. On this basis, the mechanical behavior of the front tunnel structure under different excavation methods of the secondary tunnel is discussed. The results fill the research gap in physical model testing of shallow-buried double-arch tunnels without middle drift, and have positive significance for the design and construction of similar tunnel engineering projects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Tunnel model test</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Engineering background</title><p id="Par9">The experimental study is based on the Xinmajie Tunnel Project of Nanjing Expressway in Yunnan Province, China. The tunnel has a total length of 0.39&#160;km, a maximum buried depth is 56.9&#160;m. It is a standard construction of two-way four-lane expressway. The tunnel surrounding rock mainly consists of strongly to moderately weathered shale, marl, and sandstone (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The geological conditions are weak and can be classified as Grade V according to the Chinese design codes for road tunnels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The front tunnel was excavated using the three-step method with reserved core soil, while the secondary tunnel adopted the two-step method with reserved core soil (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The tunnel is constructed by the method without middle drift, with both tunnel bores having diameters of 12.87&#160;m and no middle partition wall. The cross-sectional dimension is shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, which belongs to a double-arch tunnel without middle drift.</p><p id="Par10">

</p><p id="Par11">When the secondary tunnel of the Xinmajie Tunnel was constructed to K52&#8201;+&#8201;992&#8210;K53&#8201;+&#8201;047, it was found that the lining of the front tunnel showed signs of progressive failure. Specifically, the concrete manifestation is that the cracks first appear in the middle wall near the side of the secondary tunnel, penetrate along the thickness direction and gradually expand to the side wall of the secondary tunnel. Subsequently, local instability and vault collapse occurred in the primary support of the secondary tunnel, and further induced the overall collapse of the secondary lining of the front tunnel, forming a chain failure. During the failure process, longitudinal penetrating cracks appear synchronously on the surface, and the direction of the cracks is basically consistent with the axial direction of the tunnel. The maximum width is 20&#160;cm (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), indicating a global instability of the overlying rock mass. The preliminary analysis indicates that the front tunnel structure experienced significant secondary disturbance during the construction of the secondary tunnel. The middle wall near the side of the secondary tunnel is gradually unstable under the combined action of shear and pressure, ultimately triggering a typical cascading failure process characterized by initial cracking, subsequent collapse, and eventual structural failure. These findings highlight that the construction of double-arch tunnel without middle drift puts forward higher requirements for construction technology and surrounding rock deformation control.</p><p id="Par12">

</p><p id="Par18">The model material is an important part of the similar test. It is not only necessary to consider the mechanical properties of the surrounding rock, but also the raw materials should be as close as possible to the formation parameters of the actual project. The Xinmajie Tunnel is dominated by grade V surrounding rock. Based on previous research results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, the similar materials of surrounding rock are mainly barite powder, quartz sand and gypsum. Due to the weak cementation ability between shale and sandstone, a controlled amount of glycerol was added to improve and fine-tune the mechanical behavior of the model material. By preparing standard specimens, the mechanical parameters of similar materials were obtained by direct shear test and uniaxial compression test, and the material ratio was adjusted according to the test results (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Finally, the similar surrounding rock parameters and material ratio of the model were obtained as barite powder: quartz sand: gypsum: water&#8201;=&#8201;1: 3 :0.03 :0.12 :0.01. The specific physical and mechanical parameters of the prototype rock mass and the model similar surrounding rock materials are shown in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.</p><p id="Par19">

</p><p>Gypsum is widely recognized as an ideal elastic material, and is commonly used for lining fabrication in tunnel model experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, gypsum is selected as the main material of lining in this paper. Considering the large discreteness of gypsum, the density should not be used as the main control parameter, so the elastic modulus and compressive strength are used as the control index of the material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The primary support of the Xinmajie Tunnel construction adopts C25 shotcrete with a thickness of 25&#160;cm. To facilitate the production of the lining model, the steel arch is simplified according to the principle of stiffness equivalence, see Eq.&#160;(<xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. By calculation, the primary and secondary linings were represented by equivalent thicknesses of 30&#160;cm and 60&#160;cm of C30 concrete, respectively. The mechanical parameters of similar lining materials were obtained by universal testing machine, and the material ratio was adjusted according to the results. The final optimized mix ratio was determined to be water: gypsum&#8201;=&#8201;1: 0.7, with the corresponding mechanical parameters summarized in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Notably, due to the inherently low tensile strength of gypsum, which makes it prone to cracking, double layers of steel mesh were embedded during the casting process to enhance its tensile resistance and ensure smooth demolding after curing (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<disp-formula id="Equ2"><label>2</label><alternatives><tex-math id="d33e963">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The test results show that when the water content of expansive soil is 40% and the mass ratio of montmorillonite to quartz sand is 3: 2, the expansion pressure can reach 19.37&#160;kPa (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

Meanwhile, the secondary tunnel, which had not yet been excavated, experienced minor settlement at the crown due to disturbance from the pilot tunnel excavation, with a maximum value of 0.009&#160;mm. This suggests that the initial excavation-induced disturbance exhibited a certain degree of spatial propagation. Meanwhile, the secondary tunnel, which had not yet been excavated, experienced minor settlement at the crown due to disturbance from the front tunnel excavation, with a maximum value of 0.009&#160;mm. This suggests that the initial excavation-induced disturbance exhibited a certain degree of spatial propagation. As the excavation face passes through, the arch crown deformation rate of the front tunnel gradually decreased. After the completion of the connection, the final maximum settlement at the arch crown reached 0.067&#160;mm. During the excavation of the secondary tunnel, the deformation trend of the surrounding rock remained generally consistent with that of the front tunnel, but exhibited greater displacement magnitudes. In particular, settlement at point S3 increased progressively and peaked at 0.111&#160;mm during breakthrough, indicating a pronounced late-stage ground deformation response. At this time, the maximum deformation value of the F3 point at the corresponding position of the front tunnel is 0.090&#160;mm, which is significantly higher than the deformation value of its previous penetration. Analysis reveals that secondary tunnel excavation induced a substantial secondary disturbance to the front tunnel, contributing 25.56% of the total settlement at point F3. In contrast, only 1.80% of the total settlement at point S3 could be attributed to disturbance from the front tunnel. These findings demonstrate that, during the construction of the double-arch tunnel without middle drift tunnel, the secondary tunnel exerts a significant secondary disturbance effect on the arch crown of the front tunnel, whereas the reverse influence is relatively negligible.</p><p id="Par41">

This behavior reflects the influence of a &#8220;wedging effect&#8221; caused by excavation face disturbance under weak geological conditions, which acted in advance on the forward rock mass and led to the formation of a localized stress concentration zone. As the tunnel face approached the monitoring section, the surrounding rock pressure decreases rapidly, and enters the stage of stress release and relaxation. The local plastic zone expands significantly, and the surrounding rock is in an unstable transition state. Subsequently, the surrounding rock pressure gradually stabilized and began to rise slowly, indicating the progressive establishment of a new load-bearing path in the crown area, and the development of an arching effect. During the construction of the secondary tunnel, the zero-clearance layout led to a clear secondary disturbance in the front tunnel&#8217;s surrounding rock. A significant pressure increase was observed at the arch shoulder and inverted arch regions (F7 and F8), suggesting that the disturbance was transmitted through the structural connection zones, resulting in reverse loading and a diminished structural safety reserve. The surrounding rock pressure in the secondary tunnel shows a three-stage characteristic of &#8220;rise&#8210;sudden drop&#8210;stabilization (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>b). In the early phase, the surrounding rock was located within the residual stress field induced by the front tunnel&#8217;s disturbance. The excavation further breaks the original stress balance, especially in the inverted arch and arch shoulder (S5&#8211;S8), where significant unloading and structural weakening were observed, reflecting the sensitive area of surrounding rock failure. Furthermore, during the construction of the secondary tunnel, the stress of the side wall (F3), arch foot (F4), inverted arch (F5, F7) and arch shoulder (Z8) on the side of the secondary tunnel all increased to varying degrees.

Due to the sequential excavation of the twin tunnels, the disturbance exhibited distinct spatial and temporal asymmetry. Therefore, analyzing the internal force variation in the front tunnel lining during the secondary tunnel excavation is crucial for revealing the underlying structural stress mechanisms. The corresponding calculation results are presented in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>. After the front tunnel is penetrated, the axial force and bending moment of the lining show the distribution characteristics of &#8220;large in the upper and small in the lower, large in the right and small in the left&#8221;. The maximum axial force and bending moment are concentrated on the right wall near the side of the secondary tunnel, which are 12 kN and 2.1 kN m, respectively, which are 21.67% and 9.52% higher than those on the left side. With the advance of the secondary tunnel excavation, With the advance of the secondary tunnel excavation. When the secondary tunnel is constructed to 1/3 section, the axial force difference between the two sidewalls reached up to 58.47%. The bending moment followed a similar trend, with the right sidewall exhibiting a peak positive bending moment of 3.5 kN m, indicating significant tensile stress on the inner surface and an elevated risk of cracking. This suggests that the disturbance induced by the secondary tunnel was transmitted to the front tunnel via the structural connection region, establishing an asymmetric stress mechanism characterized by a &#8220;bias&#8211;transfer&#8211;feedback&#8221; sequence. Since the secondary lining of the secondary tunnel had not yet been installed, the structural stiffness remained insufficient, causing part of the confining pressure to be transmitted through the surrounding rock to the right side of the front tunnel lining, thereby creating a zone of stress concentration. In particular, the weak stiffness parts such as the side wall and the arch waist are prone to &#8220;tensile&#8211;shear&#8221; failure under the interaction of axial force and bending moment. This process, when combined with reverse-transmitted disturbance, may further induce a secondary collapse in the front tunnel structure.</p><p id="Par48">

The construction characteristics of zero-spacing arrangement in this structure enable the boundary constraints of the structure to be weakened, and the disturbance propagation of the surrounding rock to be more direct during the construction process. This significantly aggravates the asymmetric stress evolution characteristics of the structure-surrounding rock system. The force evolution is shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>.</p><p id="Par50">In the excavation stage of the front tunnel, the stress mode is similar to that of conventional single-hole tunnels. The surrounding rock gradually forms a pressure arch, and the load is transmitted to the side wall through the arch foot. The whole is in a small eccentric pressure state, and the structural stability is well. With the excavation of the secondary tunnel, the stress path of the structure-surrounding rock system is reconstructed. Due to the lack of partition structure, the surrounding rock load on the secondary tunnel can be transmitted to the right side of the front tunnel through the primary support and the surrounding rock between the two arches, resulting in a significant increase in the additional load in this area. At the same time, the disturbance destroys the &#8220;gripping effect&#8221; of the original rock mass, weakens the structural constraints on the right side of the front tunnel, and the force gradually evolves from a small eccentricity to a large eccentricity, and the asymmetry is significantly enhanced. The stress of the components such as the arch shoulder, arch crown and side wall of the front tunnel is uneven, the local bending moment is increased, and the risks of inner tension and outer collapse are easy to occur. Especially in the stage where the secondary lining has not been applied to the secondary tunnel, the structural stiffness is insufficient, which is more likely to cause the load to shift to the front tunnel, and form unfavorable working conditions. The test results further show that the internal force of the lining on the right side of the front tunnel (such as arch waist and side wall) increases significantly, which reflects that the disturbance has clear directionality, and the right side is the first to enter the high stress state.</p><p id="Par51">

The whole process can be divided into three stages: initial plateau&#8210;rapid rise&#8210;slow growth, which reflects that the structure&#8212;surrounding rock system changes from elastic response to stress concentration under additional load, ultimately leading to stress redistribution driven by localized structural failure.</p><p id="Par53">During the initial loading stage (0&#8210;0.3&#160;MPa), the pressure at monitoring points in the both tunnels increased slowly, the structure is in a state of compaction and bonding, and the system response is relatively stable. After entering the middle stage of loading, the pressure of surrounding rock rises rapidly, and the response trend of both tunnels gradually diverges: the stress on both sides of the inverted arch (F5, F7) and the right shoulder (F8) of the front tunnel increases significantly, with a maximum value of 0.45&#160;MPa, forming a concentrated area. Although the side of the secondary tunnel near the front tunnel also showed a significant increase, the growth rate and peak value are lower than those in the front tunnel. Some monitoring points showed a plateau later. This indicates an asymmetric response between the two tunnels. The fundamental cause of this difference lies in the initial stress asymmetry induced by the excavation sequence. The surrounding rock on the right side of the front tunnel is subjected to additional disturbance during the excavation of the secondary tunnel, forming a bias accumulation zone. As a follow-up load, the surcharge load further amplifies this initial bias pattern, resulting in a particularly significant stress concentration effect in the right arch waist and inverted arch region of the front tunnel. Meanwhile, double-arch tunnels without middle drift structural characteristics make the arch waist lap area the main load coupling path between the left and right tunnels, and the area bears a greater vertical load superposition effect. In the late stage of loading (&gt;&#8201;0.62&#160;MPa), the pressure at most monitoring points increases more slowly or tends to level off. This may result from local cracking of the structure or changes in the contact condition between the surrounding rock and the lining, which cause stress release or a shift in the load transfer path. It is worth noting that the front tunnel measuring points (F7, F8) near the side of the secondary tunnel still continue to rise, indicating that the region has not yet formed an effective crack release mechanism, and the structural deformation is still developing continuously, with a higher risk of instability.</p><p id="Par54">

Especially in the arch shoulder and inverted arch area on the side of the secondary tunnel adjacent to the front tunnel, the axial force and bending moment increase synchronously, indicating that the area gradually evolves into the core part of load transfer.</p><p id="Par56">In the early stage of loading (&lt;&#8201;0.2&#160;MPa), the structure remains in the elastic phase. Stress at all monitoring points is relatively uniform and changes slightly, and there is no significant stress concentration. With the gradual increase of load (0.2&#8211;0.5&#160;MPa), tress at the arch shoulders and inverts arch on the adjacent sides of both tunnels grows rapidly. These areas enter the nonlinear response stage first, reflecting that the stress concentration develops based on the initial disturbance. When the additional load increases to 0.6&#160;MPa, the internal force non-uniformity is further aggravated. Taking the front tunnel as an example, the axial forces of the right arch shoulder and inverted arch are increased to 115.02 kN and 102.43 kN, respectively, which are significantly higher than the initial growth rate. The corresponding bending moments increase to &#8722; 10.28 kN m and &#8722;&#8201;14.08 kN m, indicating a typical state of &#8220;high axial compression&#8211;large bending moment&#8221; interaction, and the local strength reserve of the structure is significantly reduced. In contrast, the axial force and bending moment corresponding to the left arch shoulder are reduced to 67.75 kN and &#8722;&#8201;7.26 kN m, respectively, with a decrease of 29.17% and 40.83%, showing a significant asymmetric stress distribution. This shows that under the boundary condition of the without middle drift, the additional load not only leads to the redistribution of the overall stress of the structure, but also promotes the connection area between the two arches to become the main control force path, which significantly amplifies the initial bias effect caused by the construction disturbance.</p><p id="Par57">

The local stress level of the structure is significantly improved. Under the influence of vertical load, the &#8220;elliptical&#8221; deformation trend of tunnel section is obvious, which reflects the transformation of the structure from linear elasticity to nonlinear response stage. When the load continues to increase (0.6&#8722;0.8&#160;MPa), the cracks in the inverted arch area penetrate and develop along the direction of the arch foot and the side wall (# 7, # 8), forming a typical shear-bending composite effect to induce failure, indicating that the area has entered the local instability stage.</p><p id="Par60">

The maximum settlement occurs at the point S3, located at the arch crown of the secondary tunnel, with a value of 10.05&#160;mm. As the tunnel face of the secondary tunnel approaches the monitoring section, the settlement rates of the surrounding rock in both tunnels increase simultaneously. After the tunnel face passes the section, the settlement rate gradually slows down, and the surrounding rock deformation tends to stabilize. It is worth noting that the surrounding rock at the point F3 in the front tunnel undergoes significant additional settlement due to the excavation of the secondary tunnel. The increase accounts for approximately 28.27% of the displacement observed after the initial excavation of the front tunnel, which is close to the 25.56% observed in the physical model test. The result clearly reflects the biased loading disturbance effect induced by the secondary tunnel excavation. It significantly influences the secondary deformation of the surrounding rock near the existing structure, and confirms the effectiveness and reliability of the simulation scheme.</p><p id="Par67">

</p><p id="Par79">Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref> shows the spatial distribution characteristics of the plastic zone in the surrounding rock under different working conditions. It can be observed that although the plastic zones are generally located in similar regions across all cases, all of which are concentrated in the lap area of arch waist and its surrounding areas, there are significant differences in their scale and shape. The original condition (Case 1) induces the largest extent of the plastic zone, indicating that under full-face excavation, despite the smaller advance per round, the frequent disturbances cumulatively weaken the stability of the surrounding rock. This effect is particularly pronounced at the junction between the left and right tunnels, where an extensive plastic evolution is observed. In contrast, the CD method with sequential excavation significantly reduces the disturbance to the surrounding rock. Among them, the first excavation near the side of the front tunnel (Condition 3) is the most prominent in reducing the plastic expansion in the arch waist and inverted wall area, resulting in the smallest plastic zone. This effectively suppresses the unstable evolution at the structure&#8211;rock interface. Therefore, from the perspective of controlling plastic damage in the surrounding rock, the &#8220;middle wall method (left first and right later)&#8221; proves to be the most favorable excavation approach for the secondary tunnel.</p><p id="Par80">

The results show that with the increase in excavation length, the magnitude of arch crown settlement and inverted arch heave increases significantly, and the disturbance to the structure becomes more intense. Specifically, the maximum crown settlements are 1.27&#160;m, 1.34&#160;m, and 3.16&#160;m respectively, which is 5.22% and 148.82% higher than that of 2&#160;m footage.

This shows that when the footage increases to 4&#160;m, the structural response has entered the nonlinear stage, and the deformation of surrounding rock expands sharply. From the perspective of spatial distribution characteristics, the vertical deformation of the surrounding rock shows an approximately symmetric pattern between the left and right tunnels under 2&#160;m and 3&#160;m excavation lengths, suggesting that the disturbance remains controllable.

Specifically, the maximum axial forces of the lining structure under the three working conditions are 618 kN, 859 kN, and 1285 kN, respectively, which are 39.00% and 49.59% higher than the previous working conditions.

The results show that the face offset distance exerts a significant regulatory effect on vertical deformation of the surrounding rock. When the offset distance is 6&#160;m (Case 1), the maximum settlement at the tunnel arch crown reaches 1.65&#160;cm, and the maximum uplift at the inverted arch is 0.97&#160;cm. As the distance increases to 12&#160;m (Case 2), the arch crown settlement noticeably decreases to 1.23&#160;cm, representing a reduction of 25.45%, while the inverted arch uplift remains nearly unchanged. This shows that moderately widening the distance between the twin tunnel faces helps to reduce the superimposed effects of construction-induced disturbances and improves the vertical deformation response of the surrounding rock. When the offset distance further increases to 24&#160;m (Case 3), the arch crown settlement slightly rises to 1.28&#160;cm, and the inverted arch uplift increases to 1.03&#160;cm.

Specifically, when the offset is 6&#160;m, the maximum axial force and bending moment at the arch waist of the front tunnel are 795 kN and &#8722;&#8201;385 kN m, respectively.

</p><p id="Par98">Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig26" ref-type="fig">26</xref> shows the evolution characteristics of the plastic zone in the surrounding rock under different longitudinal offsets between tunnel faces. Overall, with the increase of the distance between the left and right tunnel faces, the plastic zone of surrounding rock shows an evolution trend of &#8220;first weakening and then strengthening&#8221;. When the spacing of the tunnel face is 6&#160;m, the plastic zone is mainly concentrated in the arch waist, lap arch shoulder and inverted arch area, and the spatial distribution is more symmetrical. As the tunnel face offset increases to 12&#160;m (Condition 2), the overall extent of the plastic zone does not expand significantly. However, the maximum equivalent plastic strain decreases to 2.33e<sup>&#8722;&#8201;2</sup>, representing a reduction of approximately 31.18%. This indicates that a moderate increase in offset helps to mitigate structural interaction and suppress the intensity of plastic evolution. However, when the offset further increases to 18&#160;m (Condition 3), the maximum equivalent plastic strain value increases to 3.24e<sup>&#8722;&#8201;2</sup>, which is about 39.10% higher than that of the 12&#160;m condition. At this time, the plastic zones become more concentrated, indicating that the excessive spacing of the tunnel face may weaken the constraint coordination effect of the surrounding rock and induce a new plastic concentration zone.</p><p id="Par99">

However, certain limitations remain, and further research is necessary.</p><p id="Par101">
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>This study was based on the Xinmajie Tunnel as an engineering case, where the numerical model was established and calibrated through physical tests to analyze the effects of excavation methods, advance lengths, and staggered distances on tunnel structural behavior. Due to the specific geological conditions, tunnel geometric parameters, and lining properties involved in the model, the conclusions may not be universally applicable under different conditions. Therefore, future research should clarify the quantitative relationships among staggered distance, surrounding rock mechanical properties, and lining characteristics, thereby enhancing the applicability of these findings to a wider range of projects.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par102"> In this study, the internal forces (axial force and bending moment) of the tunnel lining structure were calculated based on the Euler&#8211;Bernoulli beam theory (Eqs.&#160;<xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="disp-formula">5</xref>). These equations are theoretically rigorous for the elastic stage. However, in the inelastic stage, they generally overestimate the internal forces. This implies that when these equations are applied for safety evaluation during the inelastic stage, the results are inherently conservative, providing an additional safety margin for the structure. Therefore, this approach can be approximately regarded as a conservative calculation method.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par103">In fact, these equations and their associated analytical method have been extensively applied in previous studies for the calculation and analysis of internal forces in tunnel lining structures during the nonlinear stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, further confirming the rationality of the approach adopted in this study. Nevertheless, future research should aim to refine these equations to more accurately capture the internal force characteristics of the lining in the inelastic stage and to enhance their applicability in engineering practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par104">Based on the similar model test and finite element numerical simulation method, this paper systematically studies the deformation response of the surrounding rock, the evolution of lining force, and the development of cracks in a double-arch tunnel without a middle wall under construction-induced disturbances and additional loading. The main conclusions are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par105">During tunnel excavation, the evolution of surrounding rock pressure exhibits a distinct staged pattern, generally following a trend of &#8220;increase&#8210;sudden drop&#8210;stabilization.&#8221; Meanwhile, the structural stress state gradually transforms from minor eccentric compression to a state dominated by large eccentric and compound loading, with the asymmetric disturbance response becoming increasingly pronounced.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par106">The construction of the secondary tunnel exerts a significant impact on the structure of the front tunnel. The maximum increase in arch crown settlement of the front tunnel reaches 25.56%. The right arch shoulder, side wall, and inverted arch of the front tunnel are subjected to superimposed eccentric loads and disturbance feedback, making them the dominant zones for structural stress redistribution and initial failure. These regions are particularly prone to tension&#8211;shear coupled failure.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par107">Under additional loading, the right arch shoulder and inverted arch of the front tunnel are the first to enter the stress concentration stage. The cracks evolution successively experienced the development path of &#8220;arch shoulder&#8594; arch crown&#8594; inverted arch&#8594; side wall.&#8221; This progression exhibits a typical asymmetric, and staged failure behavior, reflecting a gradual shift of the dominant stress-bearing zones within the structure.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par108">Reasonable construction parameters can significantly optimize the stability of tunnel structure. Under the specific working conditions, the &#8220;middle wall method (left first and right later)&#8221; combined with a smaller single-step excavation length effectively reduces both surrounding rock disturbance and structural eccentric loading. A 12&#160;m spacing exhibited the best performance in controlling settlement and limiting the development of the plastic zone. Future research should further clarify the quantitative relationship between excavation parameters and structural stability, so as to improve the engineering applicability of research conclusions.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support for this study from the National Natural Science Fund of China (No. 52078090), the Science and Technology Innovation Project of YCIC Group Co., Ltd.
