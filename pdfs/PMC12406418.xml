According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Global Tuberculosis Report 2024, there are approximately 10.8&#160;million new cases of TB, mainly in low- and middle-income countries, with limited health care resources. Based on WHO data for 2024, TB disease annually occurs in 30 countries, five of which are: India (26%), Indonesia (10%), China (6.8%), Philippines (6.8%) and Pakistan (6.3%). The disease causes approximately 1.6&#160;million deaths worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. India has the highest number of cases, with more than 2.6&#160;million new cases annually, accounting for about 26% of the global total [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. China records around 680,000 new cases of TB per year, while Indonesia faces around 969,000 cases, placing it among the countries with the highest incidence in Southeast Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Tuberculosis (TB) has a significant impact on public health, covering medical, social, and economic aspects. TB can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and lead to serious complications, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems, including those with HIV/AIDS, which increases the risk of drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. From a social perspective, stigmatization of TB often leads to social exclusion, which discourages patients from seeking treatment or continuing therapy, exacerbates the spread of the disease, and causes psychological effects, such as anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Economically, people with TB often lose productivity due to being unable to work during the long treatment period, resulting in loss of income and financial instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. At the community level, TB control burdens national health systems and hampers economic growth, especially in high-prevalence countries, due to increased treatment costs and reduced productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Tuberculosis (TB) treatment faces a number of complex challenges. The standard TB treatment regimen involves a combination of drugs that must be taken regularly for at least 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The long duration of therapy and complex regimens often lead to non-compliance, especially in patients who feel their symptoms improve before therapy is completed. In addition, TB treatment can cause side effects, such as nausea, headache, hepatotoxicity, and neuropathy, which further increases the risk of discontinuation of therapy by patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Non-adherence to treatment has serious implications, including the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), which requires longer and much more expensive treatment, with lower treatment success rates. Research shows that patient adherence to TB treatment varies, with some studies reporting non-adherence rates as high as 20&#8211;30% in some high TB burden countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Treatment adherence in TB patients is influenced by various interrelated factors. One of the main factors is the length of treatment, which often makes patients feel tired and reluctant to continue therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, complex treatment regimens and drug side effects such as nausea, dizziness, or liver damage can decrease patients&#8217; motivation to adhere to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Social factors also play an important role; the social stigma associated with TB can discourage patients from being open about their disease and hinder their access to health services. Economic factors, such as the cost of traveling to health facilities or loss of income due to time spent on treatment, can be significant barriers, especially in low-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Lack of involvement of health workers in providing adequate support and education can also lead to patients not understanding the importance of complying with therapy until completion. Psychological factors, such as the patient&#8217;s level of anxiety, depression, or internal motivation, as well as support from family and the surrounding community, also affect the level of adherence of TB patients to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">In the context of tuberculosis treatment, nurses serve as key implementers of adherence interventions, not only by delivering medication but also by leveraging digital tools to enhance patient education, monitor progress, and maintain motivation throughout the treatment journey. Nursing interventions play an important role in improving treatment adherence in people with TB. Digital-based counseling is important to be implemented by nurses to improve medication adherence in tuberculosis (TB) patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In fact, this approach has great potential to overcome the challenges of TB treatment. Various nursing strategies have been implemented, such as counseling to provide an understanding of the importance of completing treatment, as well as skills training to help patients cope with drug side effects and how to manage daily medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although counseling is an essential nursing intervention, in the reviewed studies it was often delivered through digital platforms such as SMS, video calls, or mobile apps, rather than as a stand-alone service. In addition, medication reminders, either in the form of a recorded schedule or direct medication administration by a nurse, are also used to ensure that patients follow their medication regimen appropriately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. An innovative nursing intervention approach that is gaining popularity is the use of digital technology, includes various digital adherence technologies (DATs) such as mobile apps, electronic medication monitors (EMMs), video-observed therapy (VOT), and short message service (SMS) reminders. such as mobile apps or SMS reminders, which can help patients remember their medication schedule and monitor their progress. Several studies have shown that these technology-based interventions are effective in improving medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Nursing interventions utilizing technology have great potential to improve tuberculosis medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Technology-based interventions allow for more efficient monitoring, easier communication, broader education, more personalized support, and the effectiveness of technology-based interventions can be integrated into the health care system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although nursing interventions involving technology offer great potential to improve TB medication adherence, there is still a gap between the potential and the reality of implementation in the field due to various factors such as access to technological infrastructure, patient reluctance, lack of family support so that integrated nursing interventions are needed.</p><p id="Par12">Previous review have shown that treatment adherence is important for improving the recovery of people with TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, no reviews have described interventions by nurses to improve treatment adherence in people with TB. Meanwhile, nurses have important roles as educators, counselors, and advocates in addressing problems in people with TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, this scoping review aims to explore various technology-integrated nursing interventions that have been implemented to improve medication adherence in people with tuberculosis (TB), identify the most effective technology-based strategies facilitated by nurses, and provide a clearer understanding of approaches that require further development. The findings of this study are expected to guide nursing practitioners in designing and implementing more effective, evidence-based, and technology-enhanced interventions to support TB treatment adherence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par13">This study used a scoping review design with the Arksey &amp; O&#8217;Malley approach designed to map various nursing interventions in improving treatment adherence in people with TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This approach was chosen because scoping reviews allow for a broad and comprehensive exploration of the different types of interventions that have been implemented in various contexts and can cover a wider range of literature. The steps in this scoping review include: first, identification and selection of a clear topic or research question; second, selection and screening of relevant literature using well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria; third, extraction of data from the selected articles; fourth, reporting the results in the form of relevant themes or categories. With this approach, this study aims to provide a comprehensive picture of the various nursing interventions that have been implemented in improving adherence in people with TB, as well as provide directions for further research.

</p><p id="Par45">Generally, there&#8217;s a tendency for older patients with low technological literacy to prefer SMS-based reminders due to their simplicity and accessibility. Meanwhile, younger patients with high technological literacy tend to favor app-based reminders, which offer more features and a more interactive experience. Healthcare providers need to consider their patients&#8217; demographics and offer diverse reminder options to maximize patient adherence and satisfaction. Combining both modalities (e.g., offering SMS as a basic option and an app as an advanced option) can be an effective strategy.</p><p id="Par46">Digital medication reminders not only help TB patients remember their medication schedules but also play a crucial role in increasing their motivation to remain adherent. This is because TB treatment is very long and often presents psychological challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Visualizing the progress and achievements of digital medication reminder apps can increase motivation through tangible and sustainable accomplishments. Many applications use the concept of streaks, which is a series of consecutive days of taking medication. Building and maintaining this streak can be a motivating little game. Some platforms can even award virtual badges or badges for certain achievements, such as completing a month of treatment without missing a dose, which can be a positive psychological boost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Motivation is often strengthened by positive feedback and support. The application can send periodic motivational messages or after the patient successfully takes medication for a certain period. If the PMO, family members, friends, or volunteers are also connected to the app, they can see the patient&#8217;s progress and provide direct support, both physically and through text messages. Knowing that someone else cares and is monitoring can be motivating. Digital platforms offer community features or forums where patients can share experiences, ask questions, and receive support from other patients facing similar challenges. Feeling less alone and receiving support from peers can significantly boost motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. If patients experience severe side effects or other issues that hinder motivation, the app can provide an easy way to communicate with nurses or doctors, ensuring problems are addressed before leading to non-adherence. By combining reminders, positive feedback, community support, and relevant information, digital medication reminders effectively transform the challenging journey of TB treatment into something more manageable and motivating for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">The findings of this review highlight that technology-based strategies, while effective in supporting TB medication adherence, function primarily as tools that enable and extend nursing practice. Their success is not solely determined by the availability of the technology itself, but by how nurses integrate these tools into holistic, patient-centered care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Nurses play an essential role in conducting initial patient assessments, selecting the most appropriate digital modality based on literacy level and accessibility, providing comprehensive education on treatment and technology use, and offering ongoing therapeutic support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This active involvement ensures that digital reminders and observation systems are not passive interventions, but part of a continuous, adaptive care process tailored to the individual needs of each patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">Furthermore, the effectiveness of these interventions is rooted in the integration of technological solutions within the broader scope of nursing responsibilities, which encompass motivation, psychosocial support, and health education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. By leveraging digital platforms, nurses can maintain consistent communication, address treatment-related concerns promptly, and reinforce adherence behaviors through personalized follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. This combination of human interaction and technological facilitation reflects a person-centered approach that extends beyond simple reminder functions, ultimately fostering patient empowerment and long-term adherence. Without the skilled involvement of nurses, even the most advanced technological interventions risk becoming impersonal and less effective in addressing the complex barriers to TB treatment adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">Knowledge is power, and a better understanding of diseases and treatments can be motivating. The application can provide important information about TB, why adherence is important, making it a conscious and motivated decision. With the right information and regular reminders, patients may feel more in control of their condition, reducing anxiety that can erode motivation. When patients feel empowered with information, they are more likely to be active partners in their treatment, rather than just passive recipients. The motivation of TB patients towards digital medication adherence reminders is generally high due to the reminder, monitoring, and social and emotional support features provided. However, privacy and access to technology need to be considered to maintain optimal motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par50">Interventions to improve adherence to non-digital medication are excluded. Low-tech strategies are not found in the literature and have been excluded by the search criteria. Studies focused only on digital interventions for TB medication adherence, whereas medication adherence is influenced by a variety of complex socioeconomic, cultural and health system factors, which may not be fully addressed by digital solutions. Article selection bias, where studies tend to select publications that report positive results or successful interventions, ignoring studies that show low effectiveness or failure, thus providing a picture that is not fully representative. The general, non-specific nature of the study area makes it difficult to generalize the findings. Results from one geographical area with specific infrastructure and patient characteristics may not apply in other areas with different access challenges or digital literacy. A limitation of this review is that it only includes English language articles, which may not be representative of nursing interventions in the local context.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par51">This scoping review demonstrates that nursing interventions integrating digital technology are effective in improving medication adherence among tuberculosis patients. Across the 12 reviewed studies, nurses played key roles in assessing patient needs, selecting appropriate technology (e.g., SMS reminders, mobile applications, video-based directly observed therapy), training patients and their treatment supporters, and conducting ongoing remote monitoring and motivation. By embedding these technologies into nursing practice, nurses can bridge geographical barriers, enhance patient engagement, and support sustained adherence, particularly in remote or resource-limited settings.</p><p id="Par52">Key pillar nursing interventions utilize technology, allowing remote consultation for monitoring, answering questions, and providing support without the need for face-to-face meetings, greatly reducing geographical barriers, and resource efficiency. Innovative methods allow nurses or PMOs to remotely observe patients taking medication asynchronously or synchronously, proving highly effective in ensuring every dose, reducing travel burden, and providing accurate adherence data. Education and motivation through digital media by nurses that is engaging and easy to understand can be implemented to maintain patient morale during long-term treatment. The long-term impact and application of these technology-based nursing interventions have a significant positive impact on long-term care by empowering patients to improve motivation and medication adherence.</p><p id="Par53">The implications of this scoping review suggest that digital-based technologies can be integrated into nursing practice as part of TB treatment management strategies. Nurses can use technology to provide more regular and personalized reminders to patients, and improve remote medication monitoring and support, especially for patients in hard-to-reach areas. Further research on the long-term impact of using this technology on treatment adherence and quality of life for people with TB would be beneficial. To maximize their impact, policymakers and caregivers should pilot scalable, low-cost SMS reminder systems in low-level digital literacy programs for vulnerable populations. Based on the results, it is recommended that nursing protocol interventions include SMS for patients in areas with low digital literacy while VDOT is only provided for urban areas with stable internet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
