The molecular basis of EDS implicates defects in extracellular matrix components, including various fibrillar collagens and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). However, the precise pathogenic mechanisms behind EDS remain elusive. Here, we have implemented a multi-tiered approach to demonstrate the functional impact of <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic> mutations on biochemical and developmental processes, ultimately leading to the spondylodysplastic subtype of EDS (spEDS), characterized by severe musculoskeletal symptoms. We show that the loss of function of &#946;1,3-galactosyltransferase 6 (&#946;3GalT6) is partially compensated by &#946;1,3-glucuronosyltransferase 3 (GlcAT-I), the next enzyme in the GAG biosynthetic pathway. In addition, results from transcriptomics, collagen analysis, and biophysical experiments revealed that impaired collagen maturation, including defective glycosylation of collagen XII, contributes to altered tissue structure and biomechanics, the hallmarks of spEDS. Our findings unravel a new pathogenic mechanism of spEDS and bring us one step closer to therapeutic strategies, including cell and tissue engineering.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p><italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic> pathogenic variants impair the biomechanics of connective tissue, despite a compensation mechanism of glycosaminoglycan synthesis</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="specialties"><kwd>Cell biology</kwd><kwd>Genetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="keywords"><kwd>Extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>Genetic diseases</kwd><kwd>Glycobiology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023 AAPG ANR PRC GlycoLink to SFG (IMoPA),nationale</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-INBS-0005-02,ANR-17-EURE-0003</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Maladies Rares</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/100014865</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N&#176;

Besides defects in fibrillar collagens and their modifying enzymes, the molecular heterogeneity of EDS has been expanded to enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis and other extracellular matrix (ECM) components (i.e., tenascin-X and collagen XII (Col XII)) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Because the collagen architecture and the ECM functional properties are affected in EDS, it is considered a &#8220;collagen-related disorder&#8221; (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Defects in GAG biosynthesis are severe, from strongly disabling to lethal (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and overlap with other osteochondrodysplasias, cutis laxa, hereditary myopathies, and TGF-&#946;&#8211;related disorders (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Pathogenic variants of <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-nucleotide" xlink:href="NM_080605.3">NM_080605.3</ext-link>), coding for &#946;1,3-galactosyltransferase 6 (&#946;3GalT6, B3GT3, EC 2.4.1.134), compromise the early steps of GAG synthesis. These variants are classified in the spondylodysplastic EDS (spEDS) subtype (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), in which <italic toggle="yes">B4GALT7</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SLC39A13</italic> pathogenic variants are also included (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Due to their low incidence, spEDS remain poorly explored, leading to delayed, sometimes erroneous diagnosis and late patient management.</p><p>GAGs are long linear sulfated polysaccharides attached to various core proteins forming proteoglycans (PGs), which exert versatile functions in multiple pathophysiological conditions (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). They play essential roles in embryonic and postnatal development of connective tissues (CTs) such as skin, bone, cartilage, muscle, blood vessels, and organs (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). GAGs are classified according to the composition of sugar repeats and include heparan-sulfates (HS) and chondroitin/dermatan-sulfates (CS/DS). PGs are ubiquitously expressed at the plasma membrane and in the ECM of all animal cells and tissues and exert critical functions in cell-cell and cell-matrix communication, cell signaling, and tissue homeostasis. They act as a reservoir for multiple growth factors and mediators (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). GAGs also play important roles in the ECM assembly and function by interacting with other matrix components, such as collagens, thereby ensuring the peculiar architecture and biomechanical properties of CTs (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>The biosynthesis of GAG chains requires the concerted action of multiple enzymes. These include glycosyltransferases (GTs), which initiate and elongate the saccharide backbone, and sulfotransferases, epimerases, kinases, and phosphatases, which complete their maturation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This machinery is conserved over a wide range of eukaryotic organisms and its alteration is associated with multiple pathological conditions, including cancers (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), immune diseases (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and genetic diseases (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The assembly of HS and CS/DS chains is initiated by the synthesis of a tetrasaccharide linker, Glucuronic acid-&#946;1,3-Galactose-&#946;1,3-Galactose-&#946;1,4-Xylose-&#946;1 (GlcA-&#946;1,3-Gal-&#946;1,3-Gal-&#946;1,4-Xyl-&#946;1) attached to specific serine residues of the core protein, which is necessary for the elongation of the GAG chains. &#946;3GalT6 is a Golgi membrane-bound GT that catalyses the transfer of Gal from UDP-Gal to the Gal-&#946;1,4-Xyl disaccharide linked to the core protein of a PG (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.179474DS1" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.179474DS1</ext-link>). Therefore, it is a key player in the initiation of GAG chains (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Pathogenic variants of genes encoding the enzymes implicated in the formation of the tetrasaccharide linker, including &#946;3GalT6, lead to a spectrum of severe conditions called linkeropathies (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). In a pioneering study, we identified <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic> pathogenic variants in 5 individuals from 3 Iranian families carrying a homozygous c.619G&gt;C p.(D207H) mutation (patients P1 and P2), a homozygous c.649G&gt;A p.(G217S) mutation (patient P5) or a compound heterozygous c.619G&gt;C p.(D207H)/c.323_344del p.(Ala108Glyfs*163) frameshift mutation (patients P3 and P4) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These defects were associated with extensive skeletal abnormalities, bone fragility, mild to moderate intellectual deficit, and impaired wound healing classified as spEDS (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Simultaneously, Nakajima et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) identified mutations cosegregating with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity type 1 (SEMD-JL1) and spEDS in 2 small cohorts of Eastern Asian families. These findings underscore the pleiotropic consequences of defective &#946;3GalT6 on processes that control the development and physiology of skin, bone, tendon, and ligaments. In a following study, we expanded the spEDS clinical spectrum to cardiac defects, cervical spine instability, respiratory insufficiency, and cerebrovascular accidents (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Today, the list of <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic> variants has grown to 48 mutations affecting 70 individuals (54 families), representing a large sample of affected individuals (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).

Together, the conditions caused by <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic> mutations comprise multisystemic disorders, including spEDS-<italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic> (formerly type 2 spEDS, EDSSPD2), SEMD-JL1, and Al-Gazali syndrome (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>To date, our understanding of how <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic> mutations affect protein function and GAG synthesis and how these defects cause clinical outcomes, is limited. Herein, we selected 3 pathogenic variants p.(Y182C), p.(D207H) and p.(G217S) and established their impact at multiple levels, from gene defect to phenotype (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). We demonstrate that all 3 mutations provoke a complete loss of function (LOF) of recombinant &#946;3GalT6 expressed in <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic>). Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified a common structural alteration of the catalytic site caused by these mutations. Surprisingly, despite &#946;3GalT6 LOF, patient fibroblasts and 2 CRISPR-Cas9&#8211;KO cell models retained the capacity of synthesizing GAG chains, although their content and profile were severely compromised. This residual GAG synthesis could in part be attributed to the (&#946;1,3-glucuronosyltransferase 3, GlcAT-I, EC 2.4.1.135), which is involved in the formation of the tetrasaccharide linker. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses revealed that the most dysregulated pathways were those involved in collagen maturation. A cell model of ECM synthesis revealed altered structure and biomechanics upon <italic toggle="yes">B3galt6</italic> extinction, reminiscent of the clinical situation, plausibly because Col XII, a Fibril Associated Collagen with Interrupted Triple helices (FACIT) also known as a PG, was devoid of GAG substitution. Our findings indicate that <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic> mutations severely compromise tissue biomechanics, despite residual GAG synthesis. Additionally, we have discovered a previously unknown connection between GAG synthesis and collagen maturation, which may have a significant impact on the clinical expression of spEDS and advance our understanding of its pathobiology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Disease-associated missense mutations impair &#946;3GalT6 activity due to common structural defects.</title><p>To determine the consequences of the mutations p.(Y182C), p.(D207H), and p.(G217S) encountered in spEDS-<italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic> patients (P2, P3 and P5, [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]) or SEMD-JL1 (PVII.1) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 1</xref>), we expressed and purified the recombinant WT and mutant &#946;3GalT6 proteins in <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic>. We analyzed their activity and determined, when possible, their kinetic parameters. &#946;3GalT6 is a type II transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic (Ct) N-terminus (N<sub>ter</sub>) domain, a single pass transmembrane (TM) helix, an unstructured stem region, and a globular catalytic luminal domain. Two constructs lacking both the Ct domain and the TM helix (MBP-DN<sub>ter</sub>29-WT), or in addition, the stem region (MBP-DN<sub>ter</sub>50-WT), were generated (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and led to the expression of soluble proteins (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Both truncated proteins were active towards the disaccharide Gal-&#946;1,4-Xyl(2-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phosphate)-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-7-methoxy-naphthyle (Gal-Xyl(2P)-OMN) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), but MBP-DN<sub>ter</sub>29-WT activity was higher (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sub>m</sub> value towards Gal-Xyl-(2P)-OMN was similar to those previously reported (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, mutant proteins were generated from this construct and produced to similar yields as the WT (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Strikingly, all 3 pathogenic variants, p.(G217S) (homozygous in patient P5), p.(D207H) (homozygous in patient P2 and heterozygous with a frameshift mutation in patient P3), and p.(Y182C) (homozygous in patient PVII.1) caused a complete LOF of the recombinant enzymes (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This result is consistent with the conserved status of these 3 residues across species (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), emphasizing their key functional and/or structural role. To assess whether they may induce large structural protein alterations, circular dichroism (CD) experiments were performed. The far-UV spectra of &#946;3GalT6 mutants were similar to the WT and display a classic &#945;-helix signature with a maximum at approximately 190 nm and 2 minima at approximately 210 nm and approximately 220 nm (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). This suggests that the overall conformation of each mutant is comparable to the WT, ruling out the hypothesis of large structural changes causing the LOF.</p><p>Since the structure of &#946;3GalT6 is unresolved, molecular modeling was used to localize disease-associated mutations. AlphaFold predictions suggest an &#945;/&#946;/&#945;-like organization characteristic of GTs with a GT-A fold (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), with 9 &#945;-helices and 2 &#946;-sheets: one with strands &#946;1&#8211;&#946;4 and &#946;6&#8211;&#946;8, and a second with &#946;5 and &#946;9 (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>, A and B). The positions of the disease-associated mutations (Y182C, D207H, and G217S) are shown in the 3D model, as well as the sequence alignment with &#946;1,3-<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (B3GNT2) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3C</xref>). The G217 residue lies in the strand &#946;7 buried in the active site, near the D&#215;D motif (<sup>156</sup>DDD<sup>158</sup>), critical for Mn&#178;<sup>+</sup> coordination and UDP-Gal binding (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Y182 is within &#946;6, also buried in the active site, while D207 is located in a loop (G188-P211) at the periphery of the catalytic domain (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>To assess the impact of these mutations on &#946;3GalT6 dynamics, for each of the WT and three mutants (Y182C, D207H and G217S) we performed three replicates of 1 &#956;s MD simulations, leading to a total of 12 &#956;s simulation time. Analysis of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and salt bridges revealed interaction networks within the catalytic domain. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> (upper panel) shows H-bonds with greater than or equal to 40% strength variation in at least one system; salt bridges occurring in more than 40% of simulation time are shown in the lower panel. These interactions were mapped onto the protein structures (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of WT and mutants revealed the consistent loss of a K193&#8211;D242 salt bridge in all 3 variants (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This salt bridge links the G188&#8211;P211 loop (between &#946;6 (L181-S187) and &#946;7 (Y212-S221)) and helix &#945;8 (E241&#8211;L249), likely contributing to local structural stability and ligand interactions. Its loss may underlie the LOF phenotype induced by the pathogenic variants. Supporting this, residual fluctuations analysis (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>) showed the R191&#8211;D207 segment within the G188&#8211;P211 loop exhibited high fluctuations, with reduced amplitudes in the mutants relative to WT. These changes of dynamic behavior could critically alter &#946;3GalT6 function.</p><p>Some interactions were mutation specific. Y182C and G217S showed slightly fewer interactions than WT, while D207H showed the least (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, B and C</xref>). Regarding the <sup>156</sup>DDD<sup>158</sup> motif, WT featured 2 salt bridges (K154&#8211;D156 and D158&#8211;K280) and 1 H-bond (D156&#8211;G216), which were retained in G217S and D207H but reduced or absent in Y182C. Overall, disruption of the K193&#8211;D242 critical salt bridge that stabilizes the G188-P211 flexible long loop and mutation-specific changes in interaction strength likely contribute to the LOF observed in the 3 variants. Further structural studies, including crystallization of WT &#946;3GalT6, are needed to confirm these findings.</p></sec><sec><title>&#946;3GalT6 LOF in patient fibroblasts and in B3GALT6-KO cells is partially compensated and depends on the cellular context.</title><p>To investigate the striking effect of these mutations on the activity of purified &#946;3GalT6, we used the <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic>-KO H7 clone as a KO model, for which the galactosyltransferase activity was very low and protein expression undetectable (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 6A</xref>). After reexpression of the different enzymes in this model, we measured the activities toward Gal-Xyl(2P)-OMN using the cell lysates. Our results indicate that enzyme activity could only be detected in <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic>-KO cells expressing the WT form, whereas the mutant-expressing and H7-mock cells had similar enzymatic activities, just above the detection level (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, the enzyme activity in patient fibroblasts (P2, P3, and P5) was dramatically reduced and considered as residual activity (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>). We also confirmed that the protein expression of WT and &#946;3GalT6 mutants was similar and that proteins were colocalized with the cis-Golgi marker GM130 (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>). Taken together, our data confirm that the 3 mutations cause a complete LOF of &#946;3GalT6 in purified proteins and barely detectable enzyme activities in patient fibroblasts and mutant-expressing <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic>-KO cells.</p><p>Previous analyses of CS/DS and HS in patient fibroblasts by us and others suggested that GAG synthesis was strongly impaired but still present (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). To investigate this discrepancy, we analyzed the capacity of the <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic>-KO cells to synthesize GAGs after the reexpression of WT or &#946;3GalT6 mutants. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> shows that the endogenous GAG synthesis was significantly increased in the H7-WT (4-fold), in the H7-Y182C (3-fold) cells compared with the H7-mock cells, indicating either a residual enzyme activity that couldn&#8217;t be detected in vitro previously and/or the existence of a compensation mechanism in cellulo. On the other hand, an endogenous and residual GAG synthesis was also observed in the cells expressing H7-D207H, H7-G217S, and GlcAT-I, but no significant increase was measured. Then, the exogenous xyloside 4-methylumbelliferyl-&#946;-D-xylopyranoside (4-MUX) was used to initiate GAG synthesis via &#946;4GalT7, the enzyme preceding &#946;3GalT6 in the GAG synthesis. The results showed that the synthesis of the GAG chains primed by 4-MUX (2.5 &#956;M) was significantly increased for the WT, the H7-182C, and the H7-GlcAT-I cells, which previously had the lowest endogenous GAG synthesis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the synthesis of GAG chains is increased in a dose-dependent manner in transfected <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic>-KO, including the H7-mock cells. However, the differences in GAG synthesis were no longer significant at the highest dose of 4-MUX.</p><p>To further analyze how <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic> inactivation or mutations affect in cellulo CS/DS synthesis, we examined the level of radiolabeled decorin (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) and its glycosylation by immunoblot (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). In <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, the fold-changes in the level of radiolabeled decorin were consistent with the immunoblot analysis, where higher fold-changes were associated with GAG-substituted decorin. Immunoblot analysis of the decorin in H7-WT cells exhibited a major broad band (&gt; 100 kDa), corresponding to the GAG-substituted PG and a faint signal (~ 50 kDa) corresponding to the unsubstituted core protein (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistent with the endogenous GAG synthesis and the level of radiolabeled decorin, the H7-Y182C cells exhibited a major band corresponding to the GAG-substituted decorin, which also appears to have longer GAG chains. In the H7-mock cells, the unmodified core-protein was the major band as well as in the H7-D207H and H7-G217S, although notably, the presence of a broad band of lower intensity was clearly seen for these mutants (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistent with <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, B&#8211;D</xref>, small quantity of GAGs was detected in H7-GlcAT-I cells. However, GAG biosynthesis was restored in the presence of an excess of 4-MUX, suggesting that the compensation mechanism occurring in H7-GlcAT-I cells is likely dependent on the nature and availability of the acceptor substrate.</p><p>The radiolabeled GAG chains of decorin were also analyzed in electrophoretic gels (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>) and show that the H7-mock cells and those transiently expressing the different GT, are still able to initiate GAG synthesis onto the core protein of decorin to various degrees in cellulo despite the LOF observed in vitro. This suggests that the residual GAG synthesis is maintained via an alternative pathway and highlights the fine-tuning of this process, depending on the level of GTs expression and the availability and the nature of the acceptor substrate.</p><p>A plausible hypothesis is the formation of a noncanonical trisaccharide linker (GlcA-&#946;1,3-Gal-&#946;1,4-Xyl-&#946;1) as an alternate primer for GAG synthesis, as reported in <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic>-deficient patient urine (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and in a KO-zebrafish model (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). To confirm this, patient fibroblasts P2, P3 and P5 were transfected by a silencing RNA (siRNA) targeting <italic toggle="yes">B3GAT3</italic> mRNA. Results show that, upon knockdown, the GAG-substitution of decorin was further reduced (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We next expressed and purified a truncated GlcAT-I and evaluated its activity towards the Gal-&#946;1,3-Gal-&#946;1,4-Xyl-&#946;-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-7-methoxynaphthyle (Gal-Gal-Xyl-OMN) and Gal-&#946;1,4-Xyl-&#946;-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-7-methoxynaphthyle (Gal-Xyl-OMN) analogue substrates. Results in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> indicate that GlcAT-I was highly active towards the trisaccharide Gal-Gal-Xyl-OMN, which mimics the canonical linker. In addition, the enzyme exhibited a lower (about 5-times) but significant activity towards the disaccharide Gal-Xyl-OMN (1mM). Next, in vitro glycosylation assays were performed as shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C. The step-wise addition of the first 3 glycans, leading to the formation of a [Gal&#946;1&#8211;3Gal&#946;1&#8211;4Xyl]-peptide, resulted in slower migration due to the increased molecular mass (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In presence of GlcAT-I, the full native linker, [GlcA&#946;1&#8211;3Gal&#946;1&#8211;3Gal&#946;1&#8211;4Xyl] was produced, as observed by an increase in migration speed due to the addition of a negative charge. Interestingly, for reaction mix 6 (which was without &#946;3GalT6), the partial conversion of the [Gal&#946;1&#8211;4Xyl]-peptide by GlcAT-I was observed as an additional band on the gel. The identities of the reaction products were confirmed by MALDI-TOF analysis (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 9</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrate that GlcAT-I can produce a noncanonical trisaccharide linker from different acceptor substrates when &#946;3GalT6 activity is defective, and it contributes to residual GAG synthesis in a pathological context.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptomics reveals dysregulated collagen maturation in fibroblasts from patients with spEDS.</title><p>We next examined the global impact of <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic> pathogenic variants on biological pathways.

The band was identified as the Col XII, also known as a PG, through MS analysis. Immunoblot analysis showed that the control ATDC5 cells expressed the GAG-substituted long form, visible as a smeary band more than 250 kDa, and possibly the short form (devoid of GAG-glycosylation sites) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). In <italic toggle="yes">B3galt6</italic>-KO cells, immunoblot analysis showed the presence of a sharp band corresponding to the long form of Col XII without GAG chain(s) and possibly the short form.

Height and stiffness of the pseudotissues were assessed using nanoindentation (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Spatial mapping of tissue height indicated that control pseudotissue exhibited lower values than <italic toggle="yes">B3galt6</italic>-KO, for which a higher range of values was observed. Concomitantly, stiffness mapping indicated that <italic toggle="yes">B3galt6-KO</italic> pseudotissues exhibited significantly higher Young&#8217;s moduli (median 13.95 kPa) than control (10.50 kPa), despite large variations within a same pseudotissue (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, both pseudotissues presented heterogenous distribution of Young&#8217;s moduli with stiffer zones corresponding to higher heights, that probably correspond to cell nuclei. These observations are concordant with the composition of the pseudotissues, which consist of differentiated ATDC5 cells surrounded by fibrillar collagens and noncollagenous proteins, namely PGs and glycoproteins. Altogether, our data suggested that the <italic toggle="yes">B3galt6</italic>-KO pseudotissue presented large variations in Young&#8217;s moduli and higher tissue stiffness compared with control, due to the loss of PG-GAGs and subsequent changes in collagen microarchitecture due to their absence.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic>-spEDS is the most prevalent genetic linkeropathy with approximately 50 pathogenic variants reported since the discovery of the first mutations (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Despite promising progress in the description of its clinical presentation, the underlying mechanisms of <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6-</italic>spEDS are poorly understood. The integrated molecular and cellular strategies described here fill important gaps in our understanding of <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6-</italic>spEDS pathobiology. Specifically, our study illuminates the mechanisms by which gene mutations affect &#946;3GalT6 function and the subsequent synthesis of GAGs. We demonstrate how these defects, despite the presence of a residual GAG synthesis, impair collagen maturation and ECM biomechanics.</p><p>At the molecular level, we report the efficient expression and purification of a truncated form of &#946;3GalT6 in bacteria, fully active against the acceptor substrate Gal-Xyl(2P)-OMN. We found that the 3 mutations Y182C, D207H, and G217S result in a complete LOF of the recombinant enzyme, which is concordant with the reduced galactosyltransferase activity in patient fibroblasts carrying these mutations. Nakajima et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) evaluated the activity of the following mutations, p.(M1?), p.(S65G), p.(P67L), p.(D156N), p.(R232C), and p.(C300S) and p.(S309T), identified in patients with spEDS and SEMD-JL1 and found that all expressed mutated enzymes, except p.(R232C), presented very low galactosyltransferase activity toward Gal-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-naphthyl. These results from our lab and others underscore dramatic effects of the pathogenic variants on enzyme activity.</p><p>The &#946;3GalT6 belongs to the GT31 family of the CAZy database (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.cazy.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.cazy.org/</ext-link>), and its 3D structure has not been solved yet. To overcome this lack of information, we performed large-scale atomistic MD simulations to explore the conformational dynamics of &#946;3GalT6, revealing a common mechanism accounting for the deleterious effect of the selected mutations. Comparison of the interaction network between WT and the 3 mutants highlights the loss of a salt bridge between K193 and D242. These 2 residues are located in a long flexible loop (G188-P211) and within the &#945;8 helix of the catalytic domain, respectively. We propose that the K193-D242 salt bridge plays a role in stabilizing the active site of &#946;3GalT6 by connecting key elements that belong to the catalytic center and possibly allow interactions with the substrates. Indeed, analysis of the 3D structure of B3GNT2 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), another member of the GT31 family, shows that the corresponding loop (F275-G307) contains important residues involved in donor substrate binding. In B3GNT2, K288 and Y289 form hydrogen bonds with the pyrophosphate of UDP. As these amino acids are replaced by conservative substitutions in &#946;3GalT6 (R197 and W198, respectively), they are anticipated to fulfill equivalent roles (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, Leoni et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), based on homology modeling using B3GNT2 as template, predicted that the p.(R197C) mutation, causing a severe syndrome, would substantially alter the UDP-Mn<sup>2+</sup> binding site and catalytic activity of &#946;3GalT6. Our MD simulations add further information by showing that, in &#946;3GalT6, the P194-C205 segment to which R197 and W198 belong, shows high fluctuations, and that the flexibility of this domain is reduced in all mutants, reinforcing the idea that disturbance of the UDP binding site is an important factor contributing to the observed LOF. This is supported by the identification of a p.(C206W) mutation causing early lethality of a child with Al-Gazali syndrome, which was attributed to major conformational changes of the enzyme (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In the B3GNT2 structure, the F275&#8211;G307 loop also contains residues interacting with the acceptor substrate. However, since the substrate differs from that of &#946;3GalT6, further study is needed to confirm whether the corresponding loop in &#946;3GalT6 has a similar role. In all 3 mutants, the missing salt bridge involves D242, a residue belonging to a conserved &#215;ED motif, predicted to be the catalytic base. As described for D333 in B3GNT2, and D255 in core 1/T-synthase C1GalT1 (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), another CAZY31 enzyme, it could facilitate the nucleophilic attack of the acceptor Gal<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>3 hydroxyle onto the anomeric <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>1 of the Gal donor substrate, a mechanism deployed by most inverting GTs (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Overall, the loss of a link between 2 critical elements for the catalytic domain provides a convincing rationale for the LOF observed in the 3 mutants. This hypothesis, based on predictive methods, needs to be confirmed by structural analysis.</p><p>Next, we determined the impact of the &#946;3GalT6 LOF on GAG synthesis. We showed previously that the capacity of patient fibroblasts to prime GAG synthesis using 4-MUX was severely compromised, but not absent (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In our study, similarly, the CS/DS chain of decorin was still detectable and, noticeably, its length was increased. In addition, previous studies revealed reduced (but detectable) HS expression on the cell membrane of patient fibroblasts (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), and in patient lymphoblastoid cells (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that GAG chain synthesis is not totally abrogated in <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6-</italic>spEDS patient cells.</p><p>In <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic>-KO H7 cells, the levels of endogenous GAGs and radiolabeled decorin were greatly reduced for the H7-D207H and H7-G217S mutants, highlighting their deleterious effect in cellulo. In contrast, GAG synthesis in these mutants, as well as in mock-transfected cells, was restored to levels similar to those in H7-WT cells with 4-MUX (5 &#956;M). Furthermore, we showed that, despite the lack of enzymatic activity in vitro, H7-Y182C cells produce GAG chains at levels similar to WT, as previously described for patient VII.1 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The higher capacity of H7-Y182C cells to maintain GAG synthesis can be explained by the fact that the enzyme is expressed as a transmembrane protein (while the purified protein is truncated) and by the distinct positioning of Y182, and the 2 residues, D207 and G217, which are located within and on, respectively, the other side of the flexible loop. It also suggests that Y182 is more likely to play a role in the structure than in catalyzing or binding the donor substrate. Our findings are concordant with Chen et al. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), who reported that Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) <italic toggle="yes">B3galt6</italic>-KO cells retained the capacity to produce GAGs, while the corresponding <italic toggle="yes">Xylt2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">B4galt7</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">B3gat3</italic>-KO cells were incapable of doing so, suggesting a peculiar mechanism when &#946;3GalT6 is deficient.</p><p>These results prompted us to explore the formation of an alternate linkage GlcA-Gal-Xyl serving as a GAG primer. Supporting this proposal, Persson et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) described a noncanonical linkage region in bikunin from urine of healthy individuals, and in CS chains primed from xylosides in human cell lines. In line, in a <italic toggle="yes">B3galt6</italic>-KO zebrafish model, Delbaere et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) showed that the PGs possessed a trisaccharide linkage region. This was confirmed by the analysis of the GAG linkage region of bikunin from patients with <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6-</italic>spEDS (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Our results show that decorin glycosylation was further reduced after <italic toggle="yes">B3GAT3</italic> knockdown in spEDS fibroblasts and indicate that GlcAT-I would act after &#946;4GalT7 when &#946;3GalT6 activity is absent or very low.</p><p>In agreement with the previous results, we showed that the recombinant GlcAT-I was able to use a Gal-Xyl analogue and also to catalyze the formation of the trisaccharide linker when incubated with a small peptide mimicking the CSF1 PG. In contrast, when GlcAT-I was overexpressed in cellulo, the GAG synthesis capacity appeared to differ depending on the nature and/or availability of the acceptor substrate, and, potentially, on the level of expression of &#946;3GalT6. This observation is in line with a previous study on <italic toggle="yes">B4galt7-</italic>KO CHO cells (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), which reported a possible different compartmentalization of exogenous xylosides compared with endogenous xylosylated core proteins, which could therefore facilitate or prevent GAG assembly depending on the cellular context. Further experiments, including coexpression of WT or mutant &#946;3GalT6 and GlcAT-I are necessary to fully dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying this alternative process. Collectively, it appears that a pathogenic context promotes the formation of GAGs with an immature linkage region. However, this residual GAG synthesis seems to depend on the cellular environment and could involve GlcAT-I in its fine-tuning.</p><p>By transcriptome-wide expression profiling of spEDS fibroblasts, we identified several DEGs and overrepresented biological processes linked to collagen maturation and collagen fibrils assembly, which is consistent with abnormal collagen fibril architecture of skin biopsy from the patients with spEDS (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies document the major role of matrix PGs in regulating collagen organization and ECM behavior, even if the contribution of the GAG part is not often specified and controversial (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). SLRPs, such as decorin, play a role by either juxtaposing collagen monomers through steric hindrance or directly connecting them during fibril growth. (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Decorin connects fibrillar collagens with minor collagens such as collagen VI (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) and it also interacts with FACITs, such as collagens XII and XIV, which interconnect collagen fibrils (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Additionally, large CS-PGs, such as versican and aggrecan, also regulate collagen behavior in a distinct and potentially opposite manner to SLRPs (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Therefore, the strong defects in CS chains observed in our study are likely to severely affect collagen organization.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the most strongly DEGs identified in our study were <italic toggle="yes">LOXL1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">LOXL2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">LOX,</italic> coding for 3 LOX family members, which catalyze the oxidative deamination of specific lysine residues within collagens, causing covalent collagen cross linking (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The transcriptomic spEDS signature also includes <italic toggle="yes">PLOD1</italic>, coding for the lysyl hydroxylase LH1, which modifies a subset of lysine residues within the triple-helical region of collagen, thereby modulating the structure and valency of collagen cross links (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Notably, mutation of this gene causes the kyphoscoliotic type of EDS (kEDS), which shows major clinical overlap with spEDS (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). However, it is surprising that only 12 genes overlap between the 2 transcriptomic analyses of patients deficient in <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic>. This may be explained by the fact that Ritelli&#8217;s study is based on 2 sisters, who have considerably less genetic variation than unrelated individuals. Moreover, these sisters are affected by a SEMD-JL1-type syndrome, whereas, in our work, only one patient (VII.1) was diagnosed with this disease (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Collectively, transcriptome profiling reveals changes in collagen organization and alterations in critical developmental pathways that are likely to explain the perturbation of physiological functions, from early morphogenesis to postnatal development.</p><p>We showed that, among other PGs, the GAG substitution of the FACIT Col XII was severely impaired. Widely expressed in CTs, Col XII regulates collagen fibril spacing and assembly, as well as cellular function during tissue development and regeneration (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). It is a collagen homotrimer of 3 a1(XII) chains with 2 major alternatively spliced variants, the large variant carrying four predicted GAG attachment sites (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Col XII and its binding partners, including SLRPs and tenascin X, form flexible bridges between collagen fibrils and other noncollagenous molecules, and thus regulate the organization and mechanical properties of collagen fibrils in various tissues (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Mutations in <italic toggle="yes">COL12A1</italic> cause myopathic EDS (mEDS), the symptoms of which overlap with those of spEDS. However, the function of the Col XII GAG chains is poorly documented. The defective GAG substitution of Col XII discovered here may be relevant to the pathogenesis of spEDS.</p><p>In our work, higher Young&#8217;s modulus median value was calculated in <italic toggle="yes">B3galt6-</italic>KO pseudotissues using AFM-nanoindentation technique. The nanomechanical changes within our <italic toggle="yes">B3galt6-</italic>KO model are likely to be due to the combination of at least 2 mechanisms, including the loss of water retention capacity, directly caused by the reduced GAG content, and a disorganized FACIT-collagen network resulting from impaired PG-GAG&#8211;collagen interactions. Interestingly, Vaez et al. (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) showed that glycation of collagen fibrils in collagen scaffolds leads to a higher Young&#8217;s modulus, presumably due to changes in collagen crosslinks and higher water sorption capacity. This highlights the importance of GAG negative charges and water content in the biomechanical properties of CTs. In <italic toggle="yes">Col12a1<sup>&#8211;/&#8211;</sup></italic> mice, the absence of Col XII led to disrupted collagen organization and increased stiffness of the corneal stroma as assessed by AFM (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Similarly, the increased tissue stiffness observed in our study could be due, at least partially, to the defective Col XII glycosylation. Notably, several studies have attempted to establish functional relationships between collagen organization and stiffness. In general, tissues from patients with EDS have lower elastic modulus and lower ultimate strength, which have been tentatively associated with EDS symptoms (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). In an ECM model produced by skin fibroblasts, ECM stiffness in <italic toggle="yes">PLOD1</italic>-deficient cells from patients with kEDS was slightly but not significantly lower than controls (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In our study, greater surface stiffness was shown in <italic toggle="yes">B3galt6</italic>-KO pseudotissues, suggesting that our ECM model recapitulates the characteristics of the matrix environment. It is therefore a relevant model for studying CT disorders by assessing the function of collagen, GAG-PG, and matrix bridging molecules as a whole. One limitation to our biomechanical studies is the need to better delineate the regions within the pseudotissue to directly correlate the biomechanical measurements with the biochemical and molecular modifications.</p><p>In summary, we describe here an integrated multifaceted approach that uncovers the consecutive mechanisms triggered by <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic> mutations, from protein LOF to the altered biomechanical properties of CTs in spEDS. Our study highlights the importance of better understanding the functional and physical interactions occurring within the ECM and reveals a new link between GAG synthesis and collagen maturation, implicating Col XII. Our study provides evidence for the development of new therapeutic strategies to stimulate the GAG chain biosynthetic pathway and limit the deleterious effect of GAG deficiency, thereby improving the health and quality of life of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sex as a biological variable</title><p>Patients included in our study were selected based on the type of <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic> mutation, regardless of their sex and age.

The WT and 3 mutants (Y182C, D207H, and G217S) were built with CHARMM-GUI (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) - membrane builder (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc-1?4input/membrane" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc-1?4input/membrane</ext-link>) and CHARMM36m force field, solvated with TIP3P water (12&#197; buffer) and 150 mM NaCl. Each system underwent 3 1-&#956;s replicates.</p><p>Production of the trajectories - All simulations were performed using GROMACS 2021.3 (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Energy minimization was carried out with the steepest descent algorithm for 5,000 steps, followed by NPT equilibration at 310 K, allowing lipid and solvent relaxation around the restrained protein. Harmonic restraints were applied to all protein and lipid nonhydrogen atoms and gradually reduced over 6 steps, totaling 1.875 ns. Electrostatics were treated with the PME method and van der Waals interactions were force-switched off between 10&#8211;12&#197;. Production runs were conducted in the NPT ensemble with a 2.0 fs time step, 310 K temperature (Nos&#233;-Hoover thermostat), and 1 atm pressure (Parrinello-Rahman barostat). The SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Coordinates were saved every 10 ps.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the trajectories.</title><p>Standard MD trajectory analyses were performed using the gmx module of GROMACS 2021.3. Backbone RMSD (C&#945;, C, N, O) relative to the initial frame was recorded for each replicate (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4A</xref>). Based on RMSD profiles, subsequent analyses were conducted over the last 900 ns, where systems were fully relaxed. Perresidue RMSF was computed for backbone atoms relative to the average structure (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4B</xref>). All systems remained stable during the simulations. Salt bridges were identified using VMD when the distance between oxygen atoms of acidic residues and nitrogen atoms of basic residues was less than or equal to 3.2&#197; in at least 1 frame. Their formation frequency was calculated as the number of frames where the center-of-mass distance between these atoms was less than or equal to 3.5&#197;, with the maximum value across 3 replicates recorded for each pair. Hydrogen bonds were detected using HBPLUS (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), applying geometric criteria: D&#8211;A &#8804; 3.9&#197;, H&#8211;A &#8804; 2.5&#197;, and angles &#8805; 90&#176; for D&#8211;H&#8211;A, H&#8211;A&#8211;AA, and D&#8211;A&#8211;AA (with AA indicating acceptor antecedent). For each H-bond between every pair of residues, strength was defined as the percentage of frames in which the bond was present, and the maximum value across replicates was assigned.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Gene invalidation, HeLa cell culture and transfection</title><p>HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM with high glucose supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. <italic toggle="yes">B3GALT6</italic>-KO cells were generated by transfecting cells with pX458_sghB3GALT6-2 plasmid (TACGENE, CNRS UMR 7196-INSERM U1154-Sorbonne University) containing a single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence (5&#8242;-ACGTGCTGCGGATCACGCTG-3&#8242;), the Cas9 gene and Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) coding sequence.
