My third willing donor had just been denied by the transplant center. After 5 months, the center's committee declined the donation citing their medical history, which was known from the start. I was now back at square one hoping to find another possible donor as my kidney function continued to drop. The choice of dialysis or hospice loomed closer every day.</p><p>As a physician and researcher, I initially thought getting a transplant would be a speedy and compassionate process. What I found instead was a slow, complicated, unpredictable journey for recipients and donors. I would like to share what I found on that journey and some suggestions for consideration, with the hope that it will benefit future patients and inspire reforms.</p><p>We are operating with a process and attitudes rooted in the 1950s&#8212;the first decade a kidney was transplanted. The evidence is clear that the system is not working well. CKD affects an estimated 37 million Americans.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Every year, thousands of patients with ESKD die prematurely waiting for a kidney transplant. Kidney disease is one of the top ten causes of death in the United States<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and costs taxpayers more than $37.3 billion annually in Medicare spending.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, every time a patient moves from dialysis to transplant, they receive the best standard of care and taxpayers save over $500,000<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> in Medicare costs. We could be saving thousands of lives and billions of dollars each year. Why are we not?</p><p>During my career as a physician, and recently as a patient anxiously hoping for a kidney transplant, I have learned that while our talented physicians, nurses, and others can provide great, compassionate, individual patient care, our hospitals are generally poor in adopting best practices and new standards.</p><p>While we need to recognize and appreciate what is working well, more importantly, we need to re-engineer what is not. First, let us quickly implement simple, obvious fixes, <italic toggle="yes">e.g</italic>., staff the kidney transplant phone line rather than using voice mail, work up multiple donors in parallel, and other steps. Second, design and conduct studies that generate evidence to optimize transplant health care services, medical practice, and patient outcomes. Third, implement a culture of routine measurement and embrace re-engineering, also known as continuous process improvement.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Re-engineering should include (<italic toggle="yes">1</italic>) implementing 2024 information technology and organ matching, (<italic toggle="yes">2</italic>) increasing the kidney supply&#8212;particularly by removing barriers and creating incentives for living donors&#8212;and (<italic toggle="yes">3</italic>) adopting evidence-based, patient-centered care<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> nationwide.</p><sec id="s1"><title>Information, Technology, and Matching</title><p>Good news may be on the horizon; a major change is planned for the United Network for Organ Sharing.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The goals of its Modernization Initiative are to improve the efficient and equitable allocation of transplant organs in the United States. Almost certainly, the 40-year monopoly will be broken up and new expertise added. With more accurate, timely tracking of kidneys and greater information transparency, centers and patients can improve decision making and outcomes.</p><p>In addition, personalized medicine is a significant opportunity to improve both donor&#8211;recipient pretransplant kidney matching and post-transplant immunosuppression selection and dosing. For example, increasingly eplet matching is being used to assess DNA-level histologic matching, rather than traditional antigen-level matching alone, but it is not routine. After transplant, commonly used calcineurin inhibitors reduce rejection but are nephrotoxic over time. Eplet matching and future monitoring of biomarkers may enable the tailoring of drug levels and improve kidney longevity.</p><p>Also in the future, it may be possible to induce donor's tolerance to a transplanted kidney and avoid the use of long-term immunosuppression. While studied in clinical trials with some success, further research and development is needed before it is ready and available for routine use. Additional federal funding, grants, and collaboration could accelerate this area of research.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Kidney Supply</title><p>While many Americans say <italic toggle="yes">yes</italic> to deceased organ donation, it is not enough to help the 90,000+ people on the transplant waiting list, which generally grows every year. Of the deceased donor kidneys recovered, 18%&#8211;30% are reportedly discarded, damaged, or lost.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> As a transplant surgeon recently said in regard to those lost, &#8220;While I know where my Door Dash is, I can't tell you where my kidney is.&#8221; Approximately 20,000 people are transplanted annually in the United States from deceased donors.</p><p>Increasing the supply of kidneys from voluntary living donors&#8212;approximately 6000+ annually&#8212;is key to solving this problem. They last twice as long as deceased donor kidneys, with better outcomes. Donating has been proven to be very safe, with donors' lifespans similar to nondonors. Two key barriers for living donors are the financial out-of-pocket costs and the unpredictable marathon evaluation process.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Out-of-pocket costs for living donors range from $8000 to $14,000,<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> a significant obstacle for disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. New York State recently passed legislation that reimburses those expenses. Federal legislation could use New York as a template. Alternatively, the current administration could further expand the 2019 executive order or revise the National Donor Living Assistance Center rules to reimburse all donor costs or provide a standard amount. A promising effort is the proposed 2024 End Kidney Deaths Act. The federal government would conduct a pilot study providing a $10,000 refundable tax credit for 5 years for those who donate to a stranger, <italic toggle="yes">i.e</italic>., altruistic donors&#8212;approximately 300&#8211;400 people a year currently.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Evidence-Based Patient-Centered Care</title><p>The other major barrier for living donors is the tremendously variable, inefficient, and unpredictable evaluation process. While donors expect centers to welcome them, they often face a challenging process lacking a common protocol or criteria, adequate live staffing, or seemingly a sense of urgency. The evaluation process varies immensely from 1 day to 6 months.</p><p>Why such a large variation in the time to evaluate donors? (And recipients?) Some centers cite limited resources to process potential donors and recipients more quickly. Recipients are often limited to having one potential donor evaluated at a time, while their kidney function worsens. Yet centers often refuse to accept recent blood tests, computed tomography scans, and additional studies from other hospitals&#8212;even ones within their own system&#8212;which slows the process and increases costs.</p><p>We need substantial reforms in parochial attitudes and traditional policies at transplant centers. Privacy laws and regulations are misunderstood, hindering communication. While the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act protects privacy, it also enables patients to share information. For example, surrogate maternal donors commonly opt to share ongoing pregnancy information with recipient parents. Traditional center's policies block donors and recipients from easily sharing their evaluation results, <italic toggle="yes">etc</italic>. Donor and recipient hospital transplant teams are similarly blocked, arguably delaying decision making.</p><p>Most centers use committees to decide who is allowed to donate or receive a transplant. Their roots come from the 1960's God Panels, which decided who got dialysis and who died. As a transplant surgeon recently shared, &#8220;I can't imagine a committee deciding for me that some small, hypothetical, future risk should stop me from donating a kidney to my son or daughter.&#8221; A patient deciding to be a living kidney donor should be treated no differently than any other elective medical procedure in the United States protected by informed consent and shared decision making.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>A committee denial of a willing donor sends the recipient back in line to hopefully find another donor. Meanwhile, they age, their health declines, and eventually they may not qualify for transplant. Yet, the donor can go to a different center, be worked up again over many months at additional cost, and be approved to donate.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Looking Ahead</title><p>Every patient who needs and wants a life-saving transplant should be able to get one. That is not happening today. In the short term, we need to remove obvious financial and process barriers to living donation and study incentives. In the longer term, we need every center participating in routine cycles of measuring performance, identifying barriers, creating solutions, and implementing national evidence-based changes to improve outcomes.</p><p>We have dedicated, hardworking practitioners and amazing generous donors saving the lives of determined patients receiving transplants every day. However, people are unnecessarily dying while trying to navigate the system and its barriers. Working together, we can increase the available supply of kidneys, speed up and improve the process, save money, and, most importantly, save lives.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><fig id="s001" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="kidney360-6-1409-s001.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></fig></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The content of this article reflects the personal experience and views of the author and should not be considered medical advice or recommendation.
