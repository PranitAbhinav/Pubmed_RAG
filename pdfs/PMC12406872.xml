This could include didactic teaching, interactive case-based training, instruction on the use of consultation aids (such as paper copies of guidelines) and communication skills teaching (eg, on shared decision-making) where it was relevant to antihypertensive treatment. Trials targeting exclusively secondary prevention and those conducted in secondary care settings were excluded due to the reduced scalability and potential lack of cost-effectiveness of the findings, given hypertension is predominantly managed in primary care. For the same reason, trials involving extra personnel, pay for performance or telemonitoring methods were also excluded.

We used Revman software (Cochrane Collaboration) to create forest plots.

First, the duration of interventions may have contributed to success; the one successful intervention was one of the longest, at 2 years. Improvement of medication intensification rates is likely to have partly driven an intervention&#8217;s effectiveness,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> but many patients with hypertension will only be reviewed every 6&#8211;12 months<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> and treatment may only be intensified at every few visits.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Therefore, BP changes are more appropriately evaluated in the medium to long term. The two studies that non-significantly favoured the intervention had the shortest follow-up time (5 and 6 months, respectively). These were also the smallest studies; therefore, they may have been more likely to show a favourable effect if they had been longer and better powered. Second, the intensity of follow-up may have heightened the probability of success. Only two studies provided interim follow-up for participants: one via three times per year BP assessments<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and one via six monthly follow-up appointments <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> yearly communication of BP parameters to clinicians<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>&#8212;the latter was the single successful intervention. More regular follow-up provides more opportunities for treatment intensification and lifestyle and adherence counselling; regular review has been shown to improve BP control across a variety of settings.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25 26</sup></xref> Third, increased antihypertensive use at the end of the study may have been key; the only study noting increased use was the sole effective one<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> (out of three reporting antihypertensive use<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8 10 11</sup></xref>).

Generally, the content of interventions was similar and featured teaching on hypertension and its management; however, the only successful study also provided a leaflet for GPs to keep on their desks, reiterating knowledge and treatment guidelines.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p><p>Conversely, several study characteristics appeared unrelated to effectiveness, including the level of randomisation (community, region, practice), the length of training (three interventions provided a 1-day session,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8 10 12</sup></xref> one provided three sessions<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and one a session every 2&#8201;months for 2.5 years<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>&#8212;this latter intervention was non-significantly beneficial), whether participating GPs were from university-affiliated teaching practices (both such studies described non-effective interventions<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>), setting (the only beneficial study was in a high-income country,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and the study from a low-income country<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and one in an underserved community in a high-income country<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> were non-beneficial) and patient attrition rates (these were not given for the one successful intervention, but ranged from 8%<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> to 21%<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> for the other studies). In terms of intervention content, some studies allowed GPs to select teaching topics,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> provided training on communication skills and motivational interviewing<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8 11 12</sup></xref> or used case vignettes and role play to consolidate knowledge,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8 9 12</sup></xref> but these did not appear to be related to success.</p><p>Several other outcomes, though beyond the scope of this review, were described. Two studies commented on the high acceptability of interventions to GPs.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9 11</sup></xref> CVD outcomes were reported for one study, which were non-significantly higher in the control.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Four studies examined intermediate outcomes to attempt to elucidate mechanisms for intervention effectiveness: Jafar <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> reported an increase in antihypertensive prescribing and adherence and lifestyle improvements in the intervention compared with the control groups,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and Pouchain <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> (the single effective study) reported higher numbers of antihypertensives prescribed for the intervention group.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Two of the negative studies reported no effects of the intervention on antihypertensive adherence, patient knowledge and CVD risk scores,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> or numbers of antihypertensives prescribed.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Importantly, two factorial studies which featured combined patient and clinician education arms described greater BP reductions in those arms versus clinician education only arm (ie, reductions of 12&#8201;mm Hg vs 6 mm Hg<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and 12&#8201;mm Hg vs 4 mm Hg<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>). Furthermore, these studies both demonstrated significantly more effective BP lowering in the combined patient and clinician education than in control arms.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8 9</sup></xref> These findings suggest combinations of interventions may be more advantageous than sole ones.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>We provide rigorous up-to-date evidence on cost-effective, scalable interventions addressing a key public health issue. Further strengths include the focus on the outcome (change in SBP) most likely to exert clinical effect and a comprehensive risk of bias assessment. Interventions were similar in nature (albeit with differing populations and levels of implementation), enabling valid comparisons. The review included a study from a low-income setting<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and one aimed at an underserved population,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> which may have improved generalisability. However, a key drawback of this review is the heterogeneity of results, rendering interpretation problematic, as much of the beneficial effect was driven by one large study. Therefore, we urge cautious interpretation of results. Additionally, selection bias may have detracted from the generalisability of the findings (as with all randomised controlled trials); GPs and patients willing to take part may be those who are more motivated to appropriately manage hypertension already. This was compounded by a lack of randomisation procedures at the GP or patient level in the included studies and could have biased the findings towards the null (via better BP lowering in the control arm than expected by chance). However, four out of five included studies reported cluster RCTs,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">810</xref><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> where randomisation was at the level of the cluster, but results were provided at the level of the patient&#8212;this could have led to a unit-of-analysis error. We tried to ameliorate this by using cluster-adjusted estimates. Moreover, this type of error tends to overestimate treatment effects;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> therefore, it may be less of a concern for this meta-analysis, given the aggregated result was null. GP and patient recruitment and participation rates were poorly described in all but one study,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> rendering it difficult to evaluate the impact of selection bias on the findings. Moreover, our aim was to evaluate interventions targeting primary care clinicians (including practice nurses, who provide much of the care for people with hypertension in the UK<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>), but all but one study focused on physicians (GPs); this may limit the applicability to UK practice. External validity could have been hampered further by the inclusion of two studies with a university-affiliated teaching practice population, though this did not seem to impact outcomes. Attrition, though rates in all included studies were commensurate with expected levels for similar interventions,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> may have also affected outcomes, possibly biasing towards the null as patients lost to follow-up could have been those most likely to benefit from interventions.</p><p>Further research should investigate mechanisms of intervention action so that successful mechanisms can be amplified in future interventions, for example, by measuring therapeutic inertia before and after interventions. Interventions targeting nurse and/or pharmacist education should be evaluated, given these professionals manage the majority of hypertension in the UK.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Implications on workload should be carefully evaluated. Modes of intervention delivery, for example, remotely via video call, should be evaluated to potentially maximise cost-effectiveness and scalability. While we deliberately did not focus on digital interventions due to concerns about equitable uptake in low-income or deprived settings,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> our findings may inform future digital interventions. If possible, efforts should be directed towards longer-term, sustainable initiatives, preferably coupled with patient education. Finally, CVD outcomes should be measured, after a suitable lag period, to establish preventative effectiveness as well as intermediate outcome (SBP) control.</p><p>In summary, hypertension is the key modifiable CVD risk factor and affects a quarter of the world&#8217;s population,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> yet is inadequately controlled by pharmacological treatment in at least a third of treated cases.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Thus, there is a major need to identify new models of care, particularly cost-effective ones, and this study provides important new evidence on this front. Education of primary care clinicians is a simple, acceptable and feasible<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> approach which could be rolled out at scale (eg, by remote delivery). Our findings do not support the routine use of current models of clinician education as sole interventions for suboptimal hypertension management, but suggest that more intensive, longer-term interventions may have a role in managing higher-risk patients.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The scalability of such interventions, in addition to the high prevalence of inadequately treated hypertension,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and the capacity for population-wide CVD amelioration afforded by better treatment<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31 32</sup></xref> mean that even modest SBP reductions at population level present important implications for future care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SF1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-087692</object-id><label>online supplemental figure 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s001.tif" id="d67e1207" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-087692</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s002.docx" id="d67e1212" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP2" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-087692</object-id><label>online supplemental file 2</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s003.docx" id="d67e1217" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="ST1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-087692</object-id><label>online supplemental table 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s004.docx" id="d67e1222" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="ST2" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-087692</object-id><label>online supplemental table 2</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s005.docx" id="d67e1227" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Professor Reecha Sofat and Ms. Katie Abramson, librarian at UCL, for their valuable contribution to the search strategies.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.
