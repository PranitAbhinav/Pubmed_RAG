This move has generated significant legal uncertainties and has become the focal point of a broader debate over the patentability of NGT plants. In reviewing the rationale and challenges underlying the patent ban, this article argues that the abandonment of patents diverges from established expectations. Introducing a new complete patent ban is likely to lead to several adverse consequences, including challenges related to justification, implementation, and innovation. Instead of radically altering the NGT plant patent framework, more practical and balanced alternatives within existing patent system &#8211; such as the establishment of a patent-clearing platform, the adoption of a compulsory licensing model and the creation of a labeling and traceability system &#8211; may offer more effective solutions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>EU</kwd><kwd>new genomic techniques</kwd><kwd>patent ban</kwd><kwd>regulation</kwd></kwd-group><support-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22120240585</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [22120240585].</funding-statement></funding-group></support-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><ref-count count="71"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="7015"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" disp-level="1" id="s0001"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>New Genomic Techniques (NGTs), which enable highly precise modifications to DNA and allow for more targeted, accurate and faster changes than conventional breeding, present new opportunities to harness nature.<xref rid="fn0001" ref-type="fn"><sup>a</sup></xref><fn id="fn0001" fn-type="footnote"><label><sup>a</sup></label><p>NGT, which have emerged or have been developed since 2001, can alter the genetic material of an organisms, including targeted mutagenesis, cis genesis, genome editing etc.</p></fn> In principle, plants developed through NGTs are patentable under most legal frameworks, as they involve modified DNA sequences, and the patentability of new breeding technologies and products of new breeding technologies is a separate issue from regulatory frameworks.</p><p>The European Union has made specific legislative attempts to regulate NGT plants, beginning from the European Commission Proposal in 2023 for a regulation on plants obtained by certain NGTs and their food and feed.<sup><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The patentability of NGT plants has become an issue of controversy during the negotiation about the proposed regulation. This Proposal arises from the need to accommodate novel NGTs within the existing Genetical Modified Organism (GMO) regulatory framework, aiming to create a more enabling environment for research and innovation. It categorizes two different types of NGTs: NGT 1 plants which are considered equivalent to conventional plants, and NGT 2 plants from all other plants obtained through NGTs. While the European Commission proposal initially sought to deregulate NGT 1 plants from the traditional GMO framework to foster sustainability and innovation, the European Parliament proposed a ban on all patents for NGT plants in the amendments to the Proposal (the Proposal) in 2024.<sup><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>This marks the first time that the issue of patentability has been formally addressed in the legislation governing genetically modified products in the EU. In contrast to the patent ban raised by Parliament, the Council of the EU launched a Mandate for negotiations with the European Parliament (the Mandate) in March 2025, instructing a reform within the existing patent system.<sup><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> On the one hand, Members of European Parliament (MEPs) voted to ban patents on NGT plants in order to avoid legal uncertainties, increased costs and new dependencies for farmers and breeders.<sup><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> This patent ban reflects concerns voiced by farmers and breeders. As demonstrated by an overview of patent applications, agricultural companies have been actively pursuing exclusive rights.<sup><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> On the other hand, work within the council showed that a qualified majority in favor of the patent ban could not be reached. Instead, the Council focused on increasing the level of transparency regarding patents on NGT plants, encouraging licensing on equitable conditions, and assisting operators in navigating the plant intellectual property landscape. Trilogue negotiations regarding NGT plants patent will begin with the European Parliament, the Council of Europe and Commission in the future.</p><p>Patent-related debates in agriculture are longstanding. The potential effect of the newly proposed patent ban raises further questions about its impact on existing patents and plant variety rights in the agriculture sector. Under the Proposal, NGT plants should not be subject to patent legislation, but seek protection under the Community Plant Variety Rights (CPVR) system, as laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 2100/94, as long as they meet the granting criteria.<xref rid="fn0002" ref-type="fn"><sup>b</sup></xref><fn id="fn0002" fn-type="footnote"><label><sup>b.</sup></label><p>Plant breeders are able to secure plant varieties rights for NGT varieties. The EU provides a sui generis plant variety right protection based on the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants. The protectability of NGT plants is based on their &#8220;distinctness, uniformity and stability.&#8221; This would result in NGT plants being subject to the breeder&#8217;s exemption which plays a pivotal role in the field of agricultural development and plant breeding. The breeder&#8217;s exemption allows breeders to use existing plant varieties protected by plant variety rights, to create new varieties without requiring permission from the original variety&#8217;s rights holder.</p></fn><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Some scholars have criticized plant patents for providing misguided incentives for innovation.<sup><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> For the interests of all parties, genome edited plants should be made public without prior patenting.<sup><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In practice, a campaign led by breeders and farmers successfully challenged patents on seeds. The European Patent Office (EPO) has ruled in earlier cases that conventionally bred plants should not be subject to patent protection.<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Nevertheless, other scholars, through comparative analysis, argue that patent protection has led to greater innovation outcomes and has been essential in securing a return on investment for innovators.<sup><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Not surprisingly, NGT plants cannot escape the debate of whether to patent or not. It remains uncertain whether the new patent ban will effectively reduce legal uncertainties, costs and dependency issues for farmers and breeders. The patent ban inevitably complicates the patent rules for plant, resulting in different standards for NGTs, GMO and conventionally bred plants. This paper explores the complexities surrounding patents for NGT plants. It argues that the patent ban reflects a political compromise in the broader context of deregulating NGT plants, and seeks to unpack the rationale behind it. By addressing the challenges posed by the patent ban, the paper concludes that more balanced solutions rather than an outright prohibition on patents, could better address issues related to access and utilization of NGT plants.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0002"><label>2.</label><title>Complexity Resulting from NGT Plants Patent</title><p>The development of new plant breeding technology has introduced significant challenges to the patentability of biotechnological inventions. National patent laws diverge in their treatment of patentability of GM plants, and the harmonization of legal standards across jurisdictions is a long way off. Following the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in <italic toggle="yes">Diamond v. Chakrabarty</italic><sup><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, which affirmed that &#8220;anything under the sun made by man&#8221; can be patented, the United States pioneered the patent protection of GM plants. U.S. law permits the patenting of plants as patentable subject matter. Similarly, the Australia Patent Act 1990 adopts a broad approach, allowing patent protection for new plant varieties and their propagating materials.<sup><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>In contrast, not all jurisdictions extend patent protection to GM plants. A notable exception is Canada, which has consistently denied the patentability of higher life forms, including GM plant.<sup><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> However, modified genes, protein, cells containing the modified genes and the process to create a GM plant could provide alternate avenues for securing patent protection. The rationale behind this exclusion is twofold. On the one hand, it is considered unethical to patent life forms such as plants. Patent law should not extend its scope to higher life because they should not be treated as mere object.<sup><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> On the other hand, it is viewed as unnecessary because patents on genetic materials or plant cells effectively confer control over the whole organism. Canadian courts have affirmed that the cultivation of GM plants would constitute an infringement of the patented gene and cell within the production of any form of commodity production.<sup><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Typically, when farmers buy varieties including patented genes, cells, processes, etc., they must sign a Technology Use Agreement (TUA), which details how the seeds can be used. As to the patentability of NGT plants, individual genes and process to insert a trait into a plant might be patentable, but &#8220;higher life forms&#8221; are not.<sup><xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>In the EU, the legal framework initially prohibited overlapping protection between patent and plant variety for GM Plants. This was later nuanced through a restrictive interpretation of the exception to patentability of plant varieties. The EU explicitly excludes plant varieties and essentially biological processes for the production of plants from patent protection. However, it provides leeway for patenting a plant group encompassing more than one variety, provided that the invention meets the general requirements under European patent law. Regarding GM plants, patent is available for a claim not specifically directed to a plant variety.<sup><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling confirmed that &#8220;a claim that did not specifically relate to plant varieties but to transgenic plants having certain features was allowable in the case of an invention, as long as the technical feasibility of which was not confined to a particular plant variety.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Interpretations given to patentability provisions have evolved over time, rather than carved in stone. In <italic toggle="yes">Broccoli/Tomato II</italic> case, the EPO ruled that plants produced via essentially biological processes could be patented.<sup><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Nevertheless, this was reversed in the <italic toggle="yes">Pepper</italic> case, where the Enlarged Board of Appeal (EBA) determined that the legal and factual context in Broccoli/Tomato II case had changed substantially.<sup><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The EBA, through a dynamic interpretation of Rule 28(2) of the European Patent Convention (EPC), concluded that products exclusively obtained by means of essentially biological process are not patentable. This shift was based on grammatical, systematic, and teleological interpretations of Article 53(b) EPC. Importantly, the decision clarified that GM plants, which are not exclusively obtained through biological processes, remain patentable.<sup><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>The distinction between GM plants and essentially biological processes has been further clarified in key EPO rulings. In light of the ruling in <italic toggle="yes">G 2/07</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">G 1/08</italic>, the EBA held that a process is not excluded from patentability if it contains an additional step of a technical nature that &#8220;introduce a trait into the genome or modifies a trait in the genome of the plant produced.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The long-awaited landmark <italic toggle="yes">G 3/19</italic> decision further clarified that the exception to patentability applies only to &#8220;product claims and product-by-process claims directed to plants, plant material and animals, if the claimed product is exclusively obtained by means of an essentially biological process or if the claimed process features define an essentially biological process.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Thus, neither essentially biological processes nor the plants varieties derived from them are patentable, whereas both NGT-derived plants and associated breeding methods may be eligible for patent protection.</p><p>Nevertheless, NGT plants patents present novel challenges in the context of patent infringement. Traditional genetic modifications are distinguishable from naturally occurring mutations, making enforcement relatively straightforward. However, plants produced via NGTs might be phenotypically or genotypically indistinguishable from plants developed through conventional breeding. In patent infringement scenarios, the procedure for a patent infringement would require to trace back any potentially patented origin. This creates significant evidentiary burdens in infringement proceedings as conventionally bred plants might be mistakenly classified as NGTs and encounter issues related to the burden of proof or complex evidentiary challenges.<sup><xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>Furthermore, there are growing concerns that multinational corporations may actively exploit NGTs primarily to secure patents over plant products rather than for the development of innovative breeding techniques.<sup><xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The scope of such patent claims and the applicability of derivative product protection faces uncertainty due to the wording of functional language in the Biotechnology Directive.<xref rid="fn0003" ref-type="fn"><sup>c</sup></xref><fn id="fn0003" fn-type="footnote"><label><sup>c.</sup></label><p>Article 8(2) of Directive 98/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 1998 on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions leaves room for interpretation as to what constitutes &#8220;specific characteristics obtained as the result of the invention.&#8221;</p></fn> The volume and nature of patent applications suggest an aggressive effort by the biotechnology industry to maximize protection, a trend that risks creating significant legal uncertainty and conflict within the patent system.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0003"><label>3.</label><title>A Compromise in Deregulating NGT Plant: The Patent Ban</title><p>As discussed above, it is in principle possible to patent NGT plants under current EU legislation.

This signaled a shift toward a more product-based approach. <sup><xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>As a result, the EU began to reconsider its stance on NGT plants. The move toward deregulation of NGT 1 plants soon became entangled in debates over NGT-related patents. At first glance, patentability issue seems outside the scope of regulatory reform. The EU Commission did not address patent ban issues in the 2023 proposal, as regulatory changes are separate from the patent framework. Patent protection is intended to focus on technical innovation, not regulatory classifications. Since both NGT plants and GM plants involve genetic technologies, their regulatory categorization should not determine their patentability.</p><p>Nevertheless, the eased control over NGT plants will inevitably influence patent policy in a context where large agriculture companies already have a monopoly on plants, seeds and natural resources. The linkage between deregulation and patent ban emerges from broader concerns: the potential for a growing monopoly of large companies over seeds, plant varieties, and genetic resources. This context provides an important opportunity to revisit patent policies as policymakers reconsider the supervision regulation of NGT plants. Patent disputes over NGT plants lie at the intersection of industrial innovation and breeder rights. Regulators must strike a balance, ensuring adequate incentives for innovation while preserving equitable access for breeders and farmers.</p><p>Historically, a clear legal separation is drawn between the regulatory and patent systems. As the EPO reiterated in case <italic toggle="yes">Plant Genetic System</italic> that risk assessment was regulated by national or European Directives and was a matter for bodies other than the EPO.<sup><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Institutions other than the EPO were highly competent in the technical assessment of risks. It is the risk assessment process that used science-based evidence to determine impacts and effects on human health and the environment, and could under some circumstance prohibit the exploitation of an invention.<sup><xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> This division between patent regime and GMO law system will hardly balance the interests between the farmers and the seed manufacturers.<sup><xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p>Revolutionarily, the European Parliament&#8217;s amended proposal marks a shift: deregulation and patentability of NGT plants are addressed within the same regulatory framework. On the one hand, this landmark proposal signifies a liberal regulatory environment for NGT plants. It is worth noting that this deregulation is, to some extent, involuntary and politically forced. Many member states found the CJEU&#8217;s decision in Case C-528/16 is unenforceable and unconvincing, partly due to the unavailability of the newest molecular analysis tools and partly due to the lack of data on the long-term effects to ecology and human health.<sup><xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p>The patent ban could be deemed as a compromise in deregulation of NGT plants. The primary goals of the proposal are to set reasonable boundaries that will provide incentives to industry and ensure access for farmers. One consideration for this compromise might be to promote access and prevent monopolization, as relaxing the approval regulatory process of NGT plants will raise a huge number of applications. It is estimated that 94% of NGT plants applications will be subject to very little supervision based on the proposal&#8217;s deregulation.<sup><xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> And patent holders of these NGT plants are empowered to control inventions and may benefit from commercial interests rather than public interest.<sup><xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p><p>Another consideration for this compromise might be to prevent legal uncertainties, as the EPO maintains a statutory patentability exclusion for conventionally bred plants. Legislative measures and public policies do not emerge from a vacuum and operate in isolation. The patent framework appears to be separated with GMO regulatory framework but intertwined with each other indeed. The debate over patentability of conventionally bred plants has been settled for the time being, thus agriculture practitioners often take it for granted. Whereas NGT plants possess the same characteristics as conventionally bred plants in the proposal, the patent exclusion has been suggested to maintain consistency.</p><p>Overall, navigating patentability of NGT plants is a complex and challenging task because GMO legal framework and patent framework serve different stakeholders&#8217; interests, as well as imply different power relationships and strategies. It is difficult to conclude whether this patent ban as a compromise could serve its initial aim. Further questions need to be considered: whether the patent ban is rational? Are there any concerns about its feasibility and effectiveness?</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0004"><label>4.</label><title>The Rationale Behind the Patent Ban</title><p>A number of historical, situational and social factors affect how a patent ban serves as a compromise. A historical factor is the absence of regulatory tools to prevent monopoly through patent ownership of GM plants since it raised accessibility concerns.<sup><xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In parallel with the affirmative answer to the patentability of GM plant, a growing anxiety about patent monopoly control has been observed in EU. The precautionary principle about regulating emerging biotechnology had created a paradoxical situation.<sup><xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> On the one side the patent law adopted a liberal approach to promote agricultural innovation, and on the other side the GMO law adopted a restrictive approach to commercialize GM plants considering human health and environmental safety.</p><p>While there was only one commercially available GM crop in the EU thus far, a situational factor is that NGT plants might be lined up for the market after deregulation, with potential applications in fields such as enhanced yield, disease resistance, stress tolerance, and nutrition.<sup><xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> As a result, the need for access in patent protected NGT products will probably become increased and more pressing. The European Commission did emphasize to assess the impact of patents on breeders&#8217; access to genetic material and techniques. Therefore, the deregulation was appraised for increasing agricultural innovation from one hand but criticized for growing monopolies from another hand.<sup><xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p><p>Licensing a technology and paying royalties is not new for NGT plants. The third-party users such as technology development firms, seed providers, etc., might need to obtain licenses if they are infringing on other patents, and famers buy certified seeds and pay a royalty as part of this purchase. The inappropriate application of patent right will raise the challenge of securing the freedom to operate by obtaining all necessary licenses, leading to a substantial hindrance to technology utilization and cause harm to the public.<sup><xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p><p>However, a social factor is that NGTs have lower entry costs and are more technically accessible than established genomic techniques, which means that the developers and users of these techniques are more diversified if access to and affordability of the technologies is maintained.<sup><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Accordingly, NGTs raise more concerns about increased costs and new dependencies for farmers&#8217; and breeders&#8217; access to varieties developed by the private sector.<xref rid="fn0006" ref-type="fn"><sup>f</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><fn id="fn0006" fn-type="footnote"><label><sup>f.</sup></label><p>CRISPR genome editing is set to revolutionize plant breeding and provides more rapid, efficient and precise ways toward future crops and food production compared with the previous plant breeding technologies.</p></fn><sup><xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> On the one hand, the deregulation of NGT plants exacerbates monopoly problems, allowing multinational seed companies to easily leverage their monopoly power to construct farmers&#8217; access to seeds.<sup><xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Arguably, large companies use their patents to consolidate economic power, seek profits and then deprive farmers of their freedom by making them dependent on these companies.<sup><xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Parallel to the increasing number of plant patents, they play a dominant role and potentially create monopolistic or oligopolistic scenarios, whilst small companies have disappeared in the international seed market.<sup><xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p><p>On the other hand, NGT-derived product may be covered not only by several patents on genome editing tool but also by multiple patents on multiple traits, therefore third-party users need to obtain multiple licenses.<sup><xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> With the anticipated increase in the use of NGTs, it is likely that more plant varieties will fall under the scope of multiple patents. This may significantly increase the administrative and financial burden, and create significant barriers to the use and development of NGT plants.<sup><xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup></p><p>Furthermore, the existing patent system fuels concern for reach-through licenses due to the powerful capability of genome editing technology. An NGT patentee, in order to generate value, may tend to offer licensing agreements which contain reach-through royalty obligations on the resulting products. For example, the license agreement between Broad Institute and Editas Medicine stipulates that &#8220;company shall pay to Institutions running royalties on net sales of licensed products, licensed services, enabled products, and enabled services.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> It means that any products obtained through genome editing, including a product which was made, identified, discovered, developed, selected or derived from, need to incur paying royalty regardless of whether they are included in the scope of patent claim or not. Despite some research entity such as Wageningen University has publicly announced that its entire suite of gene editing patents will be freely available for scientists in developing countries, the license must be for nonprofit application. Acquiring commercial licenses for full use of patent protected CRISPR genome editing toolkits might be expensive for agricultural scientists in developing countries.<sup><xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> It is to some extent not conducive to competition and decreasing costs because the elevated royalty fees will be incorporated into the plant product and passed to the final consumers.<sup><xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup></p><p>Hence there is a need, as outlined above, for further integration and clarification of the regulatory and patent regimes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0005"><label>5.</label><title>Potential Challenges to the Patent Ban</title><p>In view of the concerns outlined above, the proposed patent ban was intended as a compromise in the broader context of deregulation, aims to ensure access to breeding material and prevent the abuse of patent monopolies. However, this rushed patent ban seems to lag behind current developments and leaves numerous issues unresolved. The debate over the patentability of NGT plants is deeply intertwined with the ongoing deregulation of such plants. In this context, the patent ban is unlikely to serve as a straightforward solution for protecting farmers and breeders from the dominance of patent-holding corporations. This section explores why the patent ban may be misperceived as an effective solution by addressing three critical concerns: the justification challenges, the implementation challenges, and the innovation challenges.</p><sec disp-level="2" id="s0005-s2001"><label>5.1.</label><title>The Justification Challenge</title><p>For NGT 1 plant whose traits could be derived through conventional breeding, prohibiting patents on NGT 1 plants seems unreasonable, given the technical nature of the process involved. A key issue arises when it comes to NGT 1 plants, which may exhibit traits identical to those developed via conventional breeding yet are produced using genetic technology. Conventional breeding methods are often regarded as biological or traditional. As such, conventionally bred plants, including their parts such as seeds and propagation materials, are not patentable, as they fall under the category of &#8220;essentially biological processes.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> In contrast, patents protection is generally granted to plants developed through genetic technologies that do not exist in the nature.</p><p>The Technical Board of Appeal (TBA) has already provided explanations of what constitutes an essentially biological process for the production of plants in case law.<sup><xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> In particular, the Enlarged Board of Appeal provides clear exclusion of essentially biological process in landmark decisions such as G 2/07 and G1/08, if a technical step is introduced that alters or inserts a trait into the genome, beyond mere sexual crossing and selection, the process should not be excluded from patentability.<sup><xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Therefore, even though the same plant trait may be achieved through conventional breeding, the fact that NGT 1 plants contain genetic technical intervention should not be overlooked.</p><p>For NGT 2 plants, where the genomic alternations are more substantial and complex, it is even more unreasonable to ban the patents. First, the scope of patent ban is not logically analogous to the scope of deregulation. Despite that deregulation is only limited to NGT 1 plant, the patent ban covers all NGT plants. Second, NGT 2 plants are regulated similarly to GMOs and are subject to extensive authorization, export and import procedures. Given that transgenic plants can be patented, it is inconsistent to deny patent protection to NGT 2 plants, which are often functionally and technically similar. The logic is not self-consistent to enable a patent on transgenic plants but prohibiting a patent on NGT 2 plants. This inconsistency weakens the normative justification for a broad patent ban, making it appear unfocused and overly restrictive.</p><p>Furthermore, the EPO has established that a natural plant trait that is known or exists does not negate novelty&#8239;or&#8239;inventive step&#8239;of a claimed invention. In other words, even if an NGT 1 plant exhibits a trait that already exists in nature or is established, it could still meet substantive requirements to be granted a patent.<sup><xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Therefore, NGT 1 plants should still be patentable as they have technical modification in essence. Regulators have also introduced thresholds for the scale and number of modifications for NGT 1 plants, ensuring that more complex modifications remain under GMO oversight.<xref rid="fn0007" ref-type="fn"><sup>g</sup></xref><fn id="fn0007" fn-type="footnote"><label><sup>g.</sup></label><p>Annex I to the Commission proposal indicates that a NGT plant is considered equivalent to conventional plants when it differs from the parent plant by no more than 20 genetic modifications.</p></fn></p><p>In conclusion, the patent ban lacks a coherent rationale. While regulatory efforts to differentiate between traditional and technical breeding are valid, they should not overlook the innovation inherent in NGT methods. Patent law should echo the technical process, not just the product.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="s0005-s2002"><label>5.2.</label><title>The Implementation Challenge</title><p>Implementing a patent ban on NGT plants presents multiple challenges. The first implementation challenge is the lengthy and complex legislative process. Negotiations of introducing a total patent ban had come to a deadlock among EU member states. Prolonged negotiations are expected, and consensus is difficult to achieve. Despite efforts to break the deadlock, several member states, including Poland, Austria, and Slovakia, remain hesitant to support the NGT proposal.<sup><xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup></p><p>Furthermore, different attitudes of various legislative bodies render implementation considerably more challenging. The Council of EU holds substantially different opinions from the European Parliament&#8217;s patent ban approach. The &#8220;co-decision&#8221; procedure requires their agreement as co-legislators for the patent ban to be adopted in the final text. Besides, the European Commission also has an important role in EU&#8217;s interinstitutional negotiations as it has the right of proposal and function of mediating between the co-legislators in the &#8220;trilogue&#8221; negotiations. Notably, the European Commission didn&#8217;t raise any provision about patent ban in its original proposal. It may be envisioned that the patent ban will be subject to extremely complex discussions during future negotiations between co-legislators and might face revisions before its final adoption.</p><p>The second implementation challenge is from a possible conflict with the EPO. The EPC is an intergovernmental treaty that includes non-EU members, and the EPO operates independently of EU legislation.<xref rid="fn0008" ref-type="fn"><sup>h</sup></xref><fn id="fn0008" fn-type="footnote"><label><sup>h.</sup></label><p>The EPC is an international agreement that empowers the EPO to grant bundles of national patents to applicants through a single application procedure. After Brexit, the UK intends to stay within the framework of a European Patent System.</p></fn> As a result, the EPO might not follow EU law in the same rhythm and not align with the EU&#8217;s legislative direction, especially if the patent ban conflicts with existing provisions in the EPC or the EU Biotechnology Directive. Since the patent ban conflicts with the EPC and EU Biotechnology Directive, it is uncertain whether, when and how the regulators will amend the EPC or adapt its practices in accordance with the patent ban. Alternatively, the Institute of Professional Representatives before the European Patent Office (epi) has urged MEPs to reconsider the patent ban, warning it could hinder innovation.<sup><xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup></p><p>A third challenge may come from Environmentalists and Industry. Environmental groups such as the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM Europe) argue the patent ban is only a wishful thinking but far behind reality.<sup><xref rid="cit0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> The rushed legislative process leaves too many uncertainties and risks unsolved. Rather than a blanket ban, they advocate for traceability and labeling systems to manage patent-related risks. The biotech industry, including start-ups and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), is also critical of the proposed ban, warning that it could stifle innovation and undermine the long-term competitiveness in the field of genetic technology. Industry representatives have advocated for impact assessments that incorporate voices from across the innovation ecosystem. Both the justification and implementation of a patent ban on NGT plants reveal significant legal, technical, and political tensions. A more targeted and technically grounded approach, one that balances innovation incentives with public oversight, may offer a better path forward than a broad and inconsistently justified ban.<sup><xref rid="cit0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup></p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="s0005-s2003"><label>5.3.</label><title>The Innovation Challenge</title><p>In the context of EU agricultural conditions, a patent ban represents a significant deterrent to investing time and resources in developing new traits. While existing EU regulations include plant varieties exemptions, applicants still have various routes to secure patent protection for genomic modified plants, these are only viable in the absence of a patent ban. Although Article 53 EPC and Rule 26 of Implementing Regulation to the EPC define the exclusion of &#8220;plant varieties&#8221; and &#8220;essentially biological processes for the production of plants,&#8221; their scope remains unclear and unpredictable.<sup><xref rid="cit0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> Since genome edited plant patents began appearing in September 2012, their number has grown steadily worldwide.<sup><xref rid="cit0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> Notably, patent distribution is highly uneven, presenting a strong geographical bias, wherein EU filings lag far behind those in the USA and China, largely due to difference in funding systems and ethical considerations.<sup><xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup></p><p>A patent ban could further hinder the EU&#8217;s competitiveness, stifling investment in agricultural biotechnology. Genome editing and other NGTs require substantially greater investment than traditional breeding methods. Although it is simplistic to assume that more patents automatically result in more innovation, they remain one of the few effective legal instruments to protect new traits.<sup><xref rid="cit0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> In the absence of patent protection, enterprises might opt for trade secret protection in a confidential status, which would lead to less transparency and non-continuous innovation.<sup><xref rid="cit0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> Given the high cost of plant breeding, patent protection is essential for securing sustainable investment in crop innovation.<sup><xref rid="cit0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup></p><p>Agricultural development depends heavily on the introduction of specific traits, and NGTs such as genome editing allow these traits to be introduced more quickly and precisely than traditional methods. This is especially critical for orphan or underutilized crops, where genome editing enables the elimination of undesirable characteristics and improves adaptation to local or marginalized environments.<sup><xref rid="cit0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> Without patent protection, trait innovators cannot collect royalties or prevent unauthorized replication of their innovations. This hits SMEs particularly hard, as they rely heavily on patent systems to capture value and stay competitive.<sup><xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> In the absence of patents, the likelihood of commercializing any NGT plant products becomes vanishingly small.</p><p>Therefore, deregulating NGT plants without securing investment pathways is a hollow gesture. If the goal of the proposed regulation is to promote NGT plants in the European market, this cannot be achieved without enabling innovation through adequate protection. As noted by the epi, funding in this field is already limited in the EU.<sup><xref rid="cit0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> Without robust and adequate patent protection, companies will be discouraged from investing in NGTs, innovation will stall, and the EU&#8217;s ambitions to enhance competitiveness through agricultural biotechnology will be undermined. More broadly, such a ban would not only impact agriculture but could also have long-term consequences for the broader biotechnology sector by deterring future innovation and investment. Returning to the aim of proposal &#8211; to facilitate innovation and promote NGT plants to enter the European market &#8211; it is questionable whether EU will harvest the benefits from deregulation.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0006"><label>6.</label><title>Alternative Solutions to the Patent Ban</title><p>It is argued that a patent ban is not the only, or necessarily the best, solution to the paradigm shift brought about by NGTs. As discussed, abandoning NGT patent entirely might not preserve the ultimate interests of both breeders even farmers, as it raises challenges to the fairness (justifiability), enforcement (implementation), and technological advancement (innovation). Indeed, patents can act as a &#8220;necessary evil,&#8221; playing an indispensable role in incentivizing innovation.<sup><xref rid="cit0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> Instead of banning patents outright, pragmatic fixes within the existing legislative framework could be explored as alternative solutions to the patent ban, including establishing the patent clearing platform, introducing a specific ground for compulsory license and integrating public labeling and traceability database for transparency.</p><sec disp-level="2" id="s0006-s2001"><label>6.1.</label><title>Establish a Patent Clearing Platform</title><p>NGTs like CRISPR genome editing implicate large numbers of disparate social interests.<sup><xref rid="cit0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> One of the critical issues for NGT plants involves overlapping patents when a single plant variety includes multiple patented traits. With the anticipated increase in the use of NGTs, it is likely that more plant varieties will fall under the scope of multiple patents. This may lead to a situation in which third parties are required to pay royalties to several diversified intellectual property rights holders, significantly increasing the administrative and financial burden associated with farm-saved seeds, including barriers to access and obstacles to technology adoption.</p><p>The ethical license of genome editing patent portfolio such as a patent clearing platform could help facilitate access to individual patents through a standardized mechanism, reducing the risk of oligopolies control by a few dominant breeding companies.<sup><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> To address this, the European Seed Association has already introduced an agricultural crop licensing platform to simplify access to patented traits. A transparent and freely accessible patent clearing platform could prevent the creation of oligopolies of breeding companies. The Council Mandate also encourages wide access to varieties, making patents available to breeders and providing the applicable equitable licensing conditions on a voluntary basis.</p><p>Given that NGTs, such as genome editing, exemplify overlapping patents issue, the new patent clearing platform should be developed and add elements to address the need for access to NGT patents.

Consequently, if the new plant or plant variety retains the specific characteristics of the patented invention, it cannot be placed on the market without obtaining a license from the patent holder.</p></fn> NGT patents cannot be easily categorized as research tools, meaning their use generally requires a license. Refusing to grant a license or charging excessively high license fees might put technologies beyond the reach of breeders.

Conventional plants are exempt from labeling, whereas NGT 2 plants are subject to labeling and traceability obligations. The traceability and labeling of different plant products placed on the market could safeguard food chain operators&#8217; and farmers&#8217; right to information from one hand, and enable consumers to make preference choice from another hand.</p><p>To reduce inadvertent patent infringement, the system should also enhance patent transparency. At present, the EU has no obligation to mark patent information on plants and plant varieties in the EU, making it difficult to determine whether a given plant involves NGTs patents-an issue particularly salient in NGT-related litigations. Such concern could be alleviated through establishing a specific patent information database within the patent system.

Rather than resolving existing challenges, such a ban could trigger a &#8220;tragedy of the commons&#8221; scenario, where the lack of exclusive rights deters investment in innovation due to insufficient returns. The patent ban would not alleviate legal uncertainties, rising costs, or new dependencies for breeders and farmers. On the contrary, this &#8220;piggy-back&#8221; approach may further discourage innovation in the plant breeding sector. Moreover, the difficulty in distinguishing NGT plants from those produced through conventional breeding would continue to pose challenges for breeders and farmers.</p><p>Therefore, in light of the regulatory objectives of the Proposal, a patent ban appears to be a misplaced solution. Introducing a complete patent ban on NGT plants will face numerous challenges and come at a significant cost. In this light, reinterpreting and reforming the existing patent system represent a more viable, justifiable and effective strategy for addressing NGT plants. Alternative approaches, such as patent clearing platform, compulsory licenses, labeling and traceability database, could offer more effective means to navigate the complexity of the NGT patents landscape while supporting innovation and transparency.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We thank the two anonymous reviewers and the editors for very helpful feedback and advices.</p></ack><sec sec-type="COI-statement" disp-level="1" id="s0008"><title>Disclosure Statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">The proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on plants obtained by certain new genomic techniques and their food and feed, and amending Regulation (EU) 2017/625 (COM(2023)0411 &#8211; C9&#8209;0238/2023 &#8211; 2023/0226(COD)).</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="cit0002"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Amendments adopted by the European Parliament on 7 February 2024 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on plants obtained by certain new genomic techniques and their food and feed, and amending Regulation (EU) 2017/625 (COM(2023)0411 &#8211; C9-0238/2023 &#8211; 2023/0226(COD)).</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="cit0003"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Council of the European Union, Mandate for negotiations with the European Parliament, 2023/0226(COD).</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="cit0004"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">European Parliament Press, New Genomic Techniques: MEPs back rules to support green transition of farmers, July 2, 2024, Ref.: 20240202IPR17320.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="cit0005"><label>5.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Ejaz Anwer</surname><given-names>M</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Padmaja</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Kandpa</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></string-name></person-group><article-title>Trends and patterns of patent in agriculture and allied sector</article-title>. <source>J Educ Chang Intellectual Property Rights</source>. <year>2023</year>;<volume>28</volume>:<fpage>529</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>43</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="cit0006"><label>6.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Lukasiewicz</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>van de Wiel</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Lotz</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Smulders</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>Intellectual property rights and plants made by new genomic techniques: access to technology and gene-edited traits in plant breeding</article-title>. <source>Outlook Agric</source>. <year>2024</year>;<volume>53</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>205</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>15</lpage>. doi: <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1177/00307270241277219</pub-id>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="cit0007"><label>7.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Alexander Steinbach (2018)</collab></person-group>. <article-title>Technology, patents, and plants: are the next generation of GMOs patentable?</article-title><source>Ssrn J</source>. <year>2018</year> [<comment>February 28, 2019</comment>]. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2139/ssrn.3266049</pub-id>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="cit0008"><label>8.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Porter</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Durand</surname><given-names>J-L</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Elmayan</surname><given-names>T</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>Jean Louis Durand and Taline Elmayan.
