In 2021/22, 13% (17 000 staff) of all mental health staff left their positions compared with 11% across all NHS employers, resulting in an increase in vacant positions.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 3</sup></xref> The repercussions of staff shortages and high turnover extend beyond individual practitioners, affecting the remaining staff and the organisation as a whole in what has been labelled the &#8216;doom loop&#8217;,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> where increased workloads and poor staff morale add to the risk that others will leave.

Retention is known to vary among settings, services and between professions,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> but the reasons for this variation have not been fully explored in order to understand what factors affect whom and in what circumstances.

The scope (the retention of clinical mental health professionals in the English NHS) was predetermined, but the focus of the interviews was determined by the IPT, by identifying key mechanisms hypothesised to influence staff retention in mental health services. By testing and refining the IPT against real-world experiences, we could refine how different mechanisms were triggered in varying organisational contexts.</p><p>While many retention strategies are being tried in individual organisations, there is no standardised approach to this issue, and we therefore evaluated the &#8216;situation as usual&#8217; and how that was affecting retention in the participating organisations.</p><p>Our objectives were:</p><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>To interview frontline clinical staff about what influences their motivation to remain in post or to leave their role or the organisation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To interview senior staff about why they think people are leaving and organisational level strategies to improve retention and their perceived effectiveness.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To modify the IPT to more clearly reflect the real-world experiences of our participants.</p></list-item></list><p>We used multisite case studies, undertaking realist interviews<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> with senior management and frontline clinical staff (n=199) at each site to address the research question &#8216;In the context of mental health services, what factors influence staff retention, for whom, why and under what circumstances?&#8217; The topic guide was structured to cover the key areas identified in the realist review but was sufficiently open to allow for the emergence of new themes.</p><p>Results from different sources and different organisations were triangulated using comparative methods to elucidate a theory and national set of recommendations relating to retention. This study was conducted in the NHS in England, a publicly funded national healthcare system. Most services and treatments are free at the point of need and provided by organisations called Trusts. Trusts typically provide mental health services for those who live in a defined geographical area. At the time we conducted this study, there were 54 mental health Trusts within England providing a range of services, generally delivered either in community or inpatient settings. Almost all services are staffed by multidisciplinary teams of registered and unregistered clinical staff, supported by a range of administrative services. This study focused on registered clinical staff (eg, physicians, nurses, occupational therapists, psychologists and social workers) and senior managers (who may or may not be registered clinicians).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Site selection</title><p>Six English mental health Trusts were purposefully selected by the research team to be case study sites. Sites were selected to ensure variation in the following criteria:</p><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>Retention rates of clinical staff (based on the annual stability index).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Job Satisfaction score on NHS staff survey.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Care Quality Commission (CQC) ratings (national inspection body for healthcare providers).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Geographical location, encompassing urban, rural and mixed settings across England.</p></list-item></list><p>To protect anonymity, the sites are identified by letters A&#8211;F.</p><p>Three Trusts were in the South of England, two in the North and one in the Midlands. Two served urban populations, the rest served a mixture of rural and urban. Stability index in the year prior to data collection ranged from 0.795 to 0.885. Staff satisfaction ranged from two in the bottom five ratings for all English Trusts to two in the top 10 for staff satisfaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Sample and recruitment</title><p>At each site, 23&#8211;45 frontline registered clinicians and senior managers (directors or their delegates or people with specific responsibilities around retention and workforce) were interviewed to discuss what they thought were the key factors motivating staff either to leave or to remain in post. Data collection took place between March and November 2021. As this coincided with travel restrictions in the UK due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all communication was carried out using remote methods. Recruitment emails and information sheets were sent out via research and development (R&amp;D) and communications teams. In most cases, these were sent to all clinical staff as well as targeted emails to senior managers and staff networks. Some organisations did not have all-staff mailing lists, so they used multiple professional lists to reach as many staff as possible. Potential research participants responded directly to the research team by completing an online consent form. Organisations were not informed who responded to the invitations. Purposeful sampling was employed to try and address under-recruiting in key groups. For example, where we did not recruit many participants from inpatient services in response to the initial recruitment email, R&amp;D staff approached ward staff directly or used specific mailing lists to target them. These approaches were bespoke to the situation in each organisation.</p><p>All registered staff who were employed by the organisation were eligible regardless of job title.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Data collection</title><p>Data were collected via semistructured interviews with participants by telephone or online using video conferencing software. Interviews were based on a topic guide which allowed for exploration of the IPT as well as novel themes. Pilot interviews were used to test the topic guide on clinical/academic colleagues, which led to some minor changes. The topic guide was subsequently adapted during data collection to further explore new issues and emerging categories. The interviews lasted between 40 min and 80&#8201;min. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. At the start of all interviews, participants were reminded that their participation in the study was voluntary, they could withdraw at any time and the research team would maintain their anonymity. No participants decided to withdraw once they had completed the interview, but not all staff who consented were interviewed due to the research team not being able to make follow-up contact or withdrawal prior to interview due to workload commitments and capacity. Interviewers (five researchers, EW, SO, JL, EL, MS) met weekly to review the topic guide and emerging themes in line with constant comparative methodology.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Many of the interviews were highly emotive and the weekly interview meetings were also used for debriefing and peer support for the research team.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Data analysis and synthesis</title><p>A deductive, iterative approach to analysis was taken, with multiple cycles to test, refine and develop the IPT. This began on the micro level with analysis of the individual interviews, then moved to the meso level exploring patterns (CMOs) and themes within each case study and finally to the macro looking at the themes across the study sites. Qualitative coding software (Quirkos) was used to facilitate data management and analysis. The analysis was undertaken by four members of the research team (EW, SO, JL, EL). Initially, all four researchers coded the same selected transcripts to develop consensus around use of the coding framework.

This stage aimed to explore inferences about the generative causality of different contexts. This was done in iterative cycles using analysis research team meetings to test and retest similarities and differences between context and mechanisms and how and why they might lead to a range of outcomes.

They reported how reductions in the number of inpatient beds (C) and an increase in patient acuity (C) were interacting and impacting on whether staff felt they could deliver good quality of care (M) in both community and inpatient settings. There were concerns that patient acuity was rarely considered in workload/staffing plans. Many staff reported that where there was no safe staffing level on wards or capped caseloads in the community, their workload became unmanageable, and they were unable to provide the quality of care they wanted to and were reduced to &#8216;firefighting&#8217; and &#8216;risk management&#8217;.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">Staff saying that they don&#8217;t have the time to provide the quality and the level of care that they want (M)&#8230;.it&#8217;s a mini time bomb&#8230; the frustration can only be carried for so long before staff vote with their feet (O</italic>).

However, it was clear in the interviews that this was a major mechanism influencing staff satisfaction, well-being and retention (O). One way this was evident was in perceptions of a &#8216;blame culture&#8217;: while senior managers tended to assert that the organisation was supportive, many frontline staff described expecting to be blamed if anything went wrong, for example, a serious incident. This perception of blame culture (C) led to feelings of stress, a reluctance to take positive risks and to a defensive approach to practice (M). This, in turn, led to reduced job satisfaction and a belief among frontline staff that they are not able to do the best for their patients (O), linking back to the quality-of-care theme.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">I think the difficulty is people go to A&amp;E and they'll say I'm going to kill myself.

For example, while each Trust reported a visible range of staff support and development and training opportunities (C), the degree to which these were offered to staff in a fair and inclusive way was often more important than their existence (M). Staff reported in many Trusts the lack of equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. They also highlighted a lack of transparency on decisions on which staff were put forward for promotion or were able to access training and development opportunities, particularly where this involved funding (C). This led to staff feeling unfairly treated and demoralised (M).</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">Recently there is a flurry of people who have gone from our Trust to a local Trust (O), because they felt that &#8230; as a person from a different ethnic background (C), you won't be able to progress (M</italic>).

In these Trusts, staff appeared to have the energy and time to focus on these wider issues, whereas in underperforming Trusts, staff (and the organisation) were more concerned about core issues of workload and quality of care and seemed to have no capacity to think about their own development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The impact of organisational culture on feeling valued</title><p>Feeling valued was seen as a key mechanism which influenced staff&#8217;s job satisfaction and morale and retention. Underpinning many of the issues highlighted by participants was their experiences and perceptions of the organisation&#8217;s culture (C), and its direct influence on how it left staff feeling valued or undervalued. Aspects of this were identified within the review, but the interview data extended this substantially and emphasised its significance. Participants identified the importance of an organisational culture that embedded listening to, engaging with and responding to clinical staff at the core of its policies and practice, demonstrating an open and learning culture (C) with staff being valued as a central cog. Key issues raised included having trust in the leadership that staff were valued (M), leadership valuing the variety of staff opinions (M) and the organisation valuing transparent and accountable culture across all staffing groups (M).</p><p>Several participants described structural reorganisations within their Trust (C) which had left a legacy of mistrust (C).

Many highlighted the importance of the organisation&#8217;s leadership in engaging people with changes and responding to their ideas through meaningful consultation (C) as key to successful retention (O).

Team leadership was linked strongly to having a sense of belonging (M) and staff described how team leaders had a key role in anchoring staff in both their professions and posts within an organisation (M). Staff reported actively seeking roles in stable teams with team leaders who had good track records (C); this information often spread via word of mouth.

This suggests that previous research has failed to identify some ways in which retention is enhanced or undermined among mental health staff, including the influential roles played by team leaders and the need for psychological safety. Psychological safety is a mechanism that was not identified in the initial literature review or development of the IPT but was something that participants regularly mentioned and has therefore been integrated into the refined model. This was strongly linked to the support provided by leaders and teams as well as to workload levels. The model has been reworked (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>) to reflect these changes and the non-linear nature of the relationships.</p><fig position="float" id="F2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>A depiction of the final programme theory.</title></caption><graphic position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-g002.jpg"/></fig><p>In this non-linear model, organisational culture (C) unpins the other contexts within the organisation and determines if workloads are manageable, cohesiveness of teams and the opportunities and development that are available to staff (C). These secondary contexts impact on the daily working lives of staff and affect whether they feel psychologically safe, connected and valued by the organisation and their colleagues, as well as if they judge themselves as able to give good quality care (M). These mechanisms are instrumental in the way a person feels about their role and their organisation and lead to outcomes such as job satisfaction and morale and well-being (O). Job satisfaction, morale and well-being are the decisive factors in determining intent to leave (O). Some staff will leave, and some staff will stay; both will then impact on organisational culture. Is this a place where happy, satisfied staff stay or overworked staff leave? Thus, triggering the cycle to turn again.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Summary of principal findings</title><p>The interview data reinforced the crucial role of organisational culture as a factor affecting retention of mental health staff and the importance of workload and the perception of the quality of care the patients receive, both factors highlighted in the original IPT.

The realist model shows that retention cannot be effectively addressed by focussing only on the end of the process. Organisational leadership needs to look at their contexts and the mechanisms activated in their organisations. Employers should focus on staff well-being rather than consider it a &#8216;nice to have&#8217;. Staff join the health service because they want to help people. They just need to be provided with a work environment conducive to making a difference, but our research has shown that many aspects of the organisational context undermine their capacity to do so. Change happens in health services all the time, however employers need to ensure it happens in collaboration with staff rather than being imposed on them.

The lessons learnt from this investigation can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the factors affecting frontline retention, with views spanning from frontline workers to senior executives and making meaningful comparisons between different mental health organisations and services.</p><p>The data were collected from NHS sites in England, and while healthcare systems vary globally, the fundamental challenges in managing complex emotional and mental health disorders are widespread. Further research is needed to explore these findings in different cultural and healthcare contexts. This is one of the largest qualitative studies ever carried out on healthcare staff and the large number of interviews across professions, settings and services gives us confidence that at least some aspects of our findings in relation to workforce retention are more widely transferable.</p><p>The study represents a snapshot of staff experiences up to December 2021; all data were collected during a period of COVID-19 restrictions. This may have impacted the data collected; the full impact of the pandemic on mental health Trusts remains an ongoing process. We adapted our topic guide to include COVID-19&#8217;s impact on retention.</p><p>This study did not interview service user representatives and does not therefore capture their perspective on workforce retention or its impact on quality of care, although mental health service user groups were consulted during the development of this research project, particularly the formulation of the IPT. However, the main aim was to discover staff perspectives and priorities, and this was achieved.</p><p>As we only included registered staff employed by the NHS organisation, we did miss the viewpoints of non-registered staff such as healthcare assistants and registered staff like social workers who are employed by the local authority rather than the NHS.</p><p>A key strength is the size of the study: our sample of 199 interviews is very large for qualitative research. This was necessary to ensure we had reached saturation across a wide range of professions and six sites. However, we did not achieve as much representativeness across all ethnic groups as we had hoped, and our remote data collection methods may have led to some exclusion of those who were less digitally confident and connected. Some perspectives may therefore be missing from this data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Maintaining the healthcare workforce represented a huge challenge for mental health providers; retention of the current workforce is only one strategy which healthcare policy must consider. The mental health workforce has been severely overstretched with an unmanageable workload, with a consequence of a significant negative impact on the well-being of staff, particularly those in frontline clinical roles. Staff in many sites reported an organisational culture where they did not feel supported, protected or valued and described a blame culture with a lack of psychological safety.</p><p>Key factors affecting healthcare staff retention are workload, organisational culture and psychological safety. Where an organisation limits staff caseloads (C), workloads remain manageable (C); this leads to staff feeling that they can do their job well (M), and this leads to improved job satisfaction (O), leading to improved retention (O). Equally, where staff feel supported and protected by their organisation (C), they feel able to take positive risks for the benefit of their patient&#8217;s treatment (M), leading to improved job satisfaction (O), leading to improved retention (O). The current government and policy priorities need to account for the need for creating these conditions if we are to address the chronic workforce challenges in mental health services and the wider NHS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2025-102161</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s001.docx" id="d67e588" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP2" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2025-102161</object-id><label>online supplemental file 2</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s002.docx" id="d67e593" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Our thanks to all the stakeholders and participants in mental health Trusts who gave freely of their time and views to the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by The Health Foundation [grant number 1275277].
