Despite advancements in chemotherapy and immunotherapy, outcomes for patients with advanced squamous lung cancer remain suboptimal. Recent studies have shown that immunotherapy, particularly with programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, can improve survival rates, but challenges persist in achieving durable responses. Combining immunotherapy with radiotherapy has emerged as a promising strategy. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) can enhance the immune response by inducing tumour-specific antigen release and promoting systemic immune activation, while low-dose radiation (LDRT) may further potentiate these effects by modulating the immune environment. This study explores a novel triple-combination approach using SBRT, LDRT, sintilimab and chemotherapy to optimise therapeutic efficacy and improve outcomes in locally advanced or metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a randomised, controlled, open-label, multicentre phase II clinical trial involving patients with locally advanced or metastatic sqNSCLC. Participants are randomised 1:1 into two arms: the experimental arm receives SBRT and LDRT combined with sintilimab and chemotherapy, while the control arm receives sintilimab with chemotherapy alone. Randomisation is stratified by PD-L1 expression and the presence of brain metastases. The primary endpoint is the objective response rate. Secondary endpoints include disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival and safety. Based on an expected ORR of 75% for the experimental group and 55% for the control, with a 20% difference detection at 80.1% power and a two-sided &#945; level of 0.2, a total of 114 patients (57 per group, accounting for a 10% dropout rate) is required.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Commission of Sichuan University West China Hospital (2023&#8211;1582), Medical Ethics Committee of Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College (2024ER543-1), Ethics Committee of The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (2024-54-2), Ethics Committee of Union Hospital (Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology) (2024-1052-02), Ethics Committee of Sichuan Cancer Hospital (SCCHEC-02-2025-069), Clinical Trial Ethics Committee of Deyang People's Hospital (2025-03-012-H01), and Ethics Committee of Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital (2025-108).

Lung cancer, in particular, stands as the foremost cause of cancer-related deaths both in China and globally. According to the Global Cancer Statistics (GLOBOCAN), lung cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer in 2022, responsible for almost 2.5&#8201;million new cases and 1.8&#8201;million deaths worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Over the past 10 years, the incidence of lung cancer in the Chinese population has been slowly increasing as the population ages and lung cancer screening becomes more widespread nationwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The National Cancer Center of China reports 1&#8201;060&#8201;600 new lung cancer cases and 733&#8201;300 lung cancer deaths in China for the year 2022, accounting for 21.98% of all new malignant tumour cases and 28.49% of cancer-related deaths.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>Lung cancer is categorised into two primary types according to the WHO: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC represents 80%&#8211;85% of lung cancer cases and is further classified into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Lung squamous carcinoma is the second most common tissue type of NSCLC, accounting for 20%~30% of NSCLC.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5 6</sup></xref> Lung squamous carcinoma originates from basal cells, is mostly central, grows along the proximal bronchioles and invades large blood vessels and is most common in patients of advanced age, males and smokers. For a long time, the clinical treatment of lung squamous carcinoma was mainly platinum-containing doublet chemotherapy, with poorer prognosis than lung adenocarcinoma, and the overall survival (OS) needs to be improved. In recent years, with the optimisation and improvement of chemotherapeutic agents, the exploration of targeted drugs and the breakthrough of immunotherapy, the survival of patients with squamous cancer has been improved to some extent. Compared with lung adenocarcinoma, squamous lung cancer has a higher frequency of somatic cell mutation and stronger immunogenicity, which makes it more suitable for receiving immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has also made breakthroughs in squamous lung cancer in recent years, becoming an important means of treatment for squamous lung cancer.</p><p>Based on the KEYNOTE-024, KEYNOTE-042 and KEYNOTE-407 studies, pembrolizumab alone (limited to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) &#8805;50%), and pembrolizumab in combination with paclitaxel and platinum were first used for first-line treatment of advanced squamous lung cancer.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Subsequently, a large number of domestically produced programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) inhibitors have been clinically studied in advanced squamous lung cancer. RATIONALE 307 is the first successful multicentre, randomised controlled phase III clinical study of first-line immunotherapy for squamous lung cancer in China and the second in the world, with progression-free survival (PFS) in the tislelizumab+paclitaxel+carboplatin group, tislelizumab+nab-paclitaxel+carboplatin group and paclitaxel+carboplatin group of 7.6 months, 7.4 months and 5.2 months, respectively.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> ORIENT-12, the world&#8217;s first randomised, double-blind, phase III controlled clinical study exploring PD-1 monoclonal antibody in combination with gemcitabine and platinum in the first-line treatment of advanced squamous lung cancer, demonstrated that sintilimab in combination with gemcitabine and platinum significantly prolonged the PFS compared with gemcitabine and platinum (6.7 months vs 4.9 months, p&lt;0.001).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> However, the overall efficacy of chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy in squamous lung cancer remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, finding synergistic strategies for potentiated immunotherapy is an urgent task in the treatment of squamous lung cancer.</p><p>Radiotherapy (RT) is an important treatment for lung cancer, and about 50~60% of patients with lung cancer require RT. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) uses a precise positioning pattern to target high-dose irradiation to the tumour, which increases the cumulative biologically equivalent dose as much as possible while decreasing the irradiation dose to the normal tissues outside the target area, thus reducing the damage to the surrounding tissues.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Compared with conventional segmental RT, SBRT can reduce the expression of immunosuppressive cells in the tumour immune microenvironment, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and promote immune activation. RT can cause a large number of tumour cells to die within a short period of time and expose a large number of tumour-specific antigens, so that the tumour lesion becomes a natural tumour vaccine in the organism after irradiation, and even causes the unirradiated tumour to shrink or disappear (abscopal effect).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Preclinical studies have shown that SBRT in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors stimulates systemic immunity, sensitising tumour-specific T cells to enter the circulation and homing them to distant tumours, thereby delaying the growth of unirradiated tumours.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Although the SBRT+anti&#8211;programmed death receptor 1 (anti-PD-1) modality has achieved some efficacy in preclinical studies, in actual clinical practice, advanced patients with complex lesions may have multiple metastases or large lesions. Due to the limitation of normal tissue dose, SBRT cannot be applied to multiple metastatic lesions and/or large lesions over 5&#8201;cm.</p><p>Low-dose radiation (LDRT) refers to a total radiation dose of less than 10&#8201;Gy, which is often used for immunomodulation after organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases and leukaemia or lymphoma because of its mild toxicity and low damage to bone marrow-derived immune cells.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> LDRT itself has a weak tumour-killing ability, so it has not been used in the treatment of solid tumours. However, LDRT has an immunomodulatory effect, which can activate innate immunity and coordinate adaptive immunity, and induce T cells, macrophages, etc to home to the tumour to activate adaptive immunity; LDRT can also induce the upregulation of a variety of cytokines, such as interleukin-5.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> In response to clinical needs and informed by foundational research, we propose a new mode of immunotherapy combined with radiotherapy: combining immunotherapy and SBRT to treat primary tumours with LDRT to irradiate distant tumours. Our research team has found that combining high-dose RT with PD-1 inhibitors to treat primary tumours and LDRT to irradiate distant tumours can inhibit the growth of primary tumours and improve the control of distant tumours at the same time, in which T-cell recruitment is the key factor for tumour control by LDRT.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Phase I clinical studies conducted on this basis have shown better safety and efficacy.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p>Given the poor therapeutic efficacy currently associated with the treatment of advanced squamous lung cancer, exploring new and effective therapeutic modalities that can provide lasting benefits to patients has become an urgent problem in the field of lung cancer, and this study is based on identifying and solving the clinical problems. The synergistic effect of SBRT combined with LDRT and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors is still in its infancy in NSCLC. Previous studies have shown that SBRT can stimulate the systemic immune response, and LDRT, despite its weak direct tumour-killing effect, can promote the infiltration of T cells into the tumour, increase the expression of a variety of T-cell-related chemokines, enhance the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors and amplify the distal effect of SBRT.</p><p>Building on our preliminary findings from animal models and phase I clinical trials,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17 18</sup></xref> which showed that the triple therapy enhanced abscopal response and led to complete cure in more than half of the mice, and demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 60.7% with a manageable safety profile in patients, we plan to conduct a large-scale, multicentre clinical trial to further clarify the efficacy of this triple therapy. Additionally, we will leverage clinical samples and patient data to explore prognostic and adverse reaction biomarkers. The goal of this research is to provide new treatment options for patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC), optimise the combination of RT and immunotherapy and drive transformative advances in the application of tumour RT modalities.

Patients without metastatic foci at baseline do not require cranial, pelvic or whole-body bone imaging thereafter, if there are no clinical indications. PET/CT is acceptable as a screening method for baseline evaluation, and if abnormalities are detected, appropriate CT/MRI monitoring is required for subsequent evaluation. The imaging techniques should be the same for the duration of the study for the same subject. The presence of a measurable lesion is confirmed by the investigator at the study centre at the time of screening to determine subject eligibility based on RECIST V.1.1. A maximum of five target lesions in total and two target lesions per organ are included in RECIST V.1.1.</p><sec id="s2-7-1-1"><title>Baseline assessment</title><p>The first tumour imaging at screening must be performed within 28 days prior to randomisation. Prior to randomisation, the investigator at the study centre confirms that the subject has a measurable lesion that meets RECIST V.1.1 criteria.

For patients with evidence of imaging PD as first assessed by the investigator based on RECIST V.1.1, if the clinical disease is stable, there is no evidence of rapid imaging progression, and the investigator believes that the subject can continue to benefit from the investigational drug, treatment may continue on the current study regimen, with confirmation of imaging assessment to be repeated at a minimum of a 4-week interval. If the reassessment confirms PD, the patient should discontinue treatment on the study protocol; if progression is not confirmed, treatment on the study protocol will continue, with assessments at the protocol-specified time points of the imaging schedule, until PD is confirmed by an investigator authorised for this study. If the subject&#8217;s clinical disease is unstable after the first assessment of imaging PD, treatment with the study protocol will be discontinued directly without the need for imaging reassessment for confirmation after a minimum 4-week interval. According to RECIST V.1.1, at the time of subsequent tumour reassessment after the first assessment of imaging PD, the tumour lesion should be compared with the lesion condition at the time of the first PD, and confirmed imaging disease progression will be determined if one of the following conditions is met: an increase in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesion by &gt;5&#8201;mm; further progression of the non-target lesion; an increase in the sum of the longest diameters of the new lesion that appeared in the previous PD by &gt;5&#8201;mm (target lesion) or further progression (non-target lesion); and the appearance of additional new lesions.

Measurements will be statistically described using mean&#177;SD or median (minimum, maximum) unless otherwise stated. Count information is statistically described using frequencies (percentages). All statistical analyses, unless otherwise stated, will include treatment group and randomised stratification factors in the analytical model, stratified by PD-L1 expression level (TPS&lt;1%&#8201;vs TPS&#8805;1%) and brain metastasis (yes vs no).</p><p>Primary study endpoint: ORR, defined as the proportion of subjects in complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) in the analysed population, as judged by the investigator according to RECIST V.1.1 criteria, that is, ORR=(number of subjects with CR+PR)/total number of subjects&#215;100%. A binomial distribution was used to estimate the ORR and its 95%&#8201;CI for the test and control groups, as well as the difference between the groups and its 95%&#8201;CI. The determination of CR and PR should be based on the best assessment of efficacy of the tumours identified two times during the study.</p><p>Secondary endpoints: (1) DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects in CR, PR and stable disease (SD) to the total number of subjects, that is, DCR=(number of subjects with CR+PR+&#8201;SD)/total number of subjects&#215;100%. The DCR and its 95%&#8201;CI were estimated using binomial distribution for the test and control groups, and the difference between the groups and its 95%&#8201;CI; (2) DOR is defined as the time interval between the first recorded remission of the disease and the progression of the disease or death, whichever occurred first. Kaplan-Meier was used to estimate the median DOR and to plot the survival curves. (3) PFS is defined as the time from randomisation to first imaging disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Disease progression was determined based on investigator assessment according to RECIST V.1.1 criteria. Patients who do not experience disease progression or death at the time of analysis will have the time of the last tumour assessment used as the time of censoring. Between-group comparisons of PFS will be made using stratified log-rank tests along with stratified Cox proportional risk models to estimate the between-group HRs and their 95% CIs, with randomised strata as the stratification factor. The Cox proportional risk model will also be used to assess the effect of covariates on HR estimates that may be relevant to prognosis and outcome prediction. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the median PFS and its 95%&#8201;CI and to plot survival curves. (4) OS is defined as the time from randomisation to the subject&#8217;s death from any cause. OS will be compared between groups using a stratified log-rank test, and a stratified COX proportional risk model will be used to estimate the between-group HR and its 95%&#8201;CI using randomly stratified factors. The Cox proportional risk model will also be used to assess the impact of covariates that may be associated with the prediction of prognosis and efficacy on the estimate of HR.</p><p>To evaluate the efficacy of the study protocol across different subgroups, analyses will be conducted based on randomised stratification factors including PD-L1 expression level (TPS&lt;1%&#8201;vs TPS&#8805;1%), brain metastasis (yes vs no) and other possible efficacy-related variables, such as RT (SBRT overlapped with LDRT vs SBRT+LDRT), smoking history (yes vs no), ECOG PS (0 vs 1), age (&gt;60&#8201;vs &#8804; 60) and sex (male vs female). HRs and 95% CIs for PFS, OS and ORR will be estimated for each subgroup and results will be presented in forest plots.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Timeline</title><p>The trial is scheduled to begin recruitment on 1 March 2024, and is expected to complete enrolment by February 2027.</p><p>West China Hospital, the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Union Hospital (Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology), Sichuan Cancer Hospital, Deyang People's Hospital, and Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital have already initiated patient recruitment.

Current efforts focus on combining novel chemotherapy agents, targeting new pathways and integrating immunotherapy with other modalities to improve efficacy. Our study is the first phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining LDRT and SBRT with sintilimab and chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous lung cancer (stage IIIB&#8211;IV, unresectable or unsuitable for radical chemoradiotherapy). This trial builds on encouraging phase I data that suggested promising efficacy and manageable toxicity of this triple combination.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p>SBRT delivers precise, high-dose radiation that induces tumor cell death and promotes systemic immune activation via exposure of tumour antigens and release of damage-associated molecular patterns, potentially eliciting an abscopal effect.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13 21 22</sup></xref> Clinical studies such as PEMBRO-RT and MDACC have reported improved response rates and PFS when combining SBRT with PD-1 inhibitors.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23 24</sup></xref> However, SBRT is limited by normal tissue constraints, especially for treating multiple or large lesions (&gt;5&#8201;cm). LDRT modulates the tumour microenvironment differently by inducing transient inflammation and reprogramming immunosuppressive tumour-associated macrophages to a pro-inflammatory phenotype, thereby enhancing infiltration and function of CD4+ and&#8201;CD8+ T&#8201;cells, natural killer cells and dendritic cells.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">1525</xref><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Clinically, LDRT combined with immunotherapy has demonstrated a favourable safety profile and immunomodulatory effects.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15 28 29</sup></xref> Sintilimab, a human IgG4 monoclonal PD-1 antibody, has shown significant efficacy in both non-squamous and squamous NSCLC, including improved OS, PFS and ORR.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11 30 31</sup></xref></p><p>The integration of SBRT and LDRT with sintilimab is expected to leverage the complementary mechanisms of these modalities&#8212;SBRT&#8217;s tumour ablation and immune priming, LDRT&#8217;s microenvironmental remodelling and PD-1 blockade&#8217;s immune activation&#8212;to enhance antitumour responses.</p><p>Strengths of this study include its novel multimodal approach targeting both local and systemic disease, supported by preliminary safety and efficacy data. The trial incorporates comprehensive monitoring of AEs, with special attention to pneumonitis and RT-related toxicities, critical for assessing the feasibility of this regimen. Limitations include the inherent challenges of phase II trials such as sample size and patient heterogeneity, which may impact the generalisability of results.</p><p>In conclusion, this phase II trial aims to provide valuable evidence on the efficacy and safety of combining LDRT and SBRT with sintilimab and chemotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic sqNSCLC. It represents an important step towards optimising treatment by harnessing the synergy between RT and immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-094859</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-s001.docx" id="d67e638" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82373021); the 1&#183;3&#183;5 Project for Disciplines of Excellence, West China Hospital, Sichuan University (No. ZYJC21003 and No. ZYYC23010); the Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province (2025ZNSFSC0045); Beijing Xisike Clinical Oncology Research Foundation (Y-HS202202-0094 and Y-2024AZ(NSCLC)ZD-0267) and Noncommunicable Chronic Diseases-National Science and Technology Major Project (2024ZD0520200).
