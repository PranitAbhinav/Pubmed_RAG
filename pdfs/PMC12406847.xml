Despite progress in TB care, unfavourable treatment outcome persists, highlighting the need to identify determinants and address gaps in paediatric TB management. This study aimed to assess treatment outcomes and identify determinants of unfavourable outcomes in children treated for TB at a referral centre in Cameroon.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This retrospective cohort study included children aged &lt;15 years diagnosed with TB and followed at the Jamot Hospital of Yaound&#233; from 2001 to 2020. Treatment outcome was classified as favourable (cured or treatment completed) or unfavourable (death, treatment failure or loss to follow-up). Sociodemographic and clinical data were recorded. A Poisson regression model was applied to evaluate temporal trends in the annual incidence of unfavourable outcomes. Logistic regression was used to identify determinants of unfavourable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 881 children included, 52.1% were female and 40.7% were &#8804;5 years. HIV status was unknown for 36.9% and positive for 10.1% of children. Extrapulmonary TB was found in 34.5% of children. The cumulative incidence of unfavourable outcome was 24.5% (95% CI 21.7% to 27.5%). Loss to follow-up (19.8%) was the most frequent unfavourable outcome, followed by death (4.5%) and treatment failure (0.2%). A decreasing trend in the annual proportion of unfavourable outcomes was observed. Determinants of unfavourable outcome included: residence out of Yaound&#233; (adjusted OR (aOR) 12.51; 95%&#8201;CI 1.10 to 5.58; p=0.02), unknown HIV status (aOR 2.10; 95%&#8201;CI 1.47 to 3.00; p&lt;0.001) and retreatment status (aOR 7.25; 95%&#8201;CI 1.98 to 29.45; p=0.003).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite encouraging improvements over time, unfavourable outcomes remain high in paediatric TB. Strengthening HIV testing, follow-up systems and access to care for children in rural areas is essential to sustain and accelerate progress in TB treatment success.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>Patient Outcome Assessment</kwd><kwd>Clinical Epidemiology</kwd><kwd>Respiratory Infection</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><sec><title>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC</title><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in resource-limited settings, yet long-term data on determinants of unfavourable outcomes in African contexts are limited.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS</title><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>This 20-year cohort study from a TB referral centre in Cameroon identifies that residence outside the town of the treatment centre, unknown HIV status and retreatment are determinants of unfavourable treatment outcome in paediatric TB.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY</title><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>These findings highlight the urgent need for systematic HIV testing, enhanced patient follow-up systems and equitable access to TB care, which may inform future research, clinical practice and health policy.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the top infectious disease killers worldwide, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations such as children.

Most studies focus narrowly on mortality or are conducted over short timeframes, using small cohorts, and fail to capture the broader determinants of unfavourable outcomes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9 10</sup></xref> Additionally, few studies provide long-term data on paediatric TB outcomes in high-burden settings.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 3</sup></xref> To address these gaps, we conducted a 20-year retrospective cohort study in a TB reference centre in Cameroon. Our objective is to evaluate treatment outcomes comprehensively, identify predictors of unfavourable outcome and provide robust data to inform interventions aimed at improving long-term paediatric TB care in resource-limited settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design, setting and participants</title><p>This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Centre for Diagnosis and Treatment of TB (CDT) of the Jamot Hospital of Yaound&#233; (JHY), a specialised referral hospital for TB and respiratory diseases for Yaound&#233; (capital city of Cameroon) and surrounding areas. The CDT receives approximately 1500&#8211;1800 patients annually and also hosts an approved treatment centre that provides care to people living with HIV infection. A systematic sampling approach was used, selecting cases based on predefined eligibility criteria. No formal sample size calculation was performed, as the study aimed to include the total population of eligible patients over the 20-year period, maximising the power. All children aged &lt;15 years registered and followed up at the CDT from January 2001 to December 2020 (20 years) whose treatment records contained complete information on age and gender were included. We excluded children who were transferred during the follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>Patients and the public were not involved in the design, conduct, or analysis of this study, as it was a retrospective, record-based cohort study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>TB diagnosis and treatment</title><p>Since its establishment in 2000, TB diagnosis and treatment at JHY have followed the National Tuberculosis Control Programme guidelines and WHO recommendations.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11 12</sup></xref> Paediatric TB diagnosis combines clinical, radiological, bacteriological and histological evidence. For pulmonary TB (PTB), smear-positive (bacteriologically confirmed) cases (SPPTB) are confirmed by identifying acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in sputum or gastric aspirates using Ziehl-Neelsen or auramine staining, with one positive result sufficing for diagnosis. Since 2017, the introduction of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF test has significantly improved sensitivity for detecting TB, particularly in children with smear-negative TB. Smear-negative (clinically diagnosed) PTB (SNPTB) was diagnosed in children with persistent TB symptoms, a history of contact with an infectious TB case and suggestive chest X-rays, despite two negative smear results and failure to improve after 10 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) was diagnosed based on clinical suspicion supported by site-specific investigations such as biopsies, imaging or cytology. In accordance with the national TB programme guidelines during the study period, systematic drug susceptibility testing was not routinely performed in children due to the predominance of clinical diagnosis and challenges in microbiological confirmation. The cohort, therefore, consisted primarily of children treated for presumed drug-susceptible TB. Data on resistance patterns, including multidrug-resistant TB, were not available in this programme dataset.</p><p>All patients were classified as new or retreatment cases (relapse, treatment failure, return after default or defaulter) and received standardised regimens. Antituberculosis drugs were dispensed free of charge. Treatment regimens were standard regimens of category I for new patients and of category II for retreatment cases. All localisations of TB (except for neuromeningeal and bone) were treated as follows. New cases were treated with a regimen that includes an intensive phase of 2 months duration with rifampicin (R), isoniazid (H), ethambutol (E) and pyrazinamide (Z), followed by a 4-month continuation phase with rifampicin and isoniazid (2RHEZ/4RH). During retreatment, category I medications (R, H, E, Z) were completed with streptomycin (S). Therefore, retreatment cases were treated with RHEZS for 2 months, followed by 1&#8201;month on RHEZ and 5 months on RHE (2RHEZS/1RHEZ/5RHE). From 2017 to 2019, streptomycin was removed and the protocol was the same as new cases. Since 2019, retreatment cases are receiving 6 months of RHEZ. The continuation phase lasted 10 months for central nervous system, bones and joints TB. During the intensive phase, adherence was directly monitored by the healthcare team for patients admitted, and during weekly drug collection in those treated as outpatients. The continuation phase was conducted on an outpatient basis and adherence was assessed during monthly visits for renewal and drugs collection. Additionally, since 2005, systematic HIV screening has been progressively implemented as part of TB care. At that time, free care for both diseases (TB and HIV) had been initiated, but management was not yet integrated within the same care units. Children who tested positive for HIV received free antiretroviral therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Monitoring and outcome of TB</title><p>During treatment, SPPTB children were re-examined for AFB and SNPTB and EPTB children were followed up clinically at the end of months 2, 5 and 6 for new cases, and at the end of months 3, 5 and 8 for patients receiving retreatment. At the end of the treatment, patients are ranked into mutually exclusive categories as : (1) cured - patient with a negative smear at the last month of treatment and at least one of the preceding; (2) treatment completed&#8212;patient who has completed the treatment and for whom the smear result at the end of the last month is not available; (3) failure&#8212;patient with a positive smear at the fifth month or later during treatment; (4) death&#8212;death from any cause during treatment; (5) defaulter or LTFU&#8212;patient whose treatment has been interrupted for at least two consecutive months and (6) transfer&#8212;patient transferred to complete his treatment in another centre and whose treatment outcome is unknown. The primary outcome of interest in our study was treatment outcome, categorised as either favourable or unfavourable. Favourable outcome included patients classified as &#8216;cured&#8217; or &#8216;treatment completed&#8217;, while unfavourable outcome included &#8216;death&#8217;, &#8216;treatment failure&#8217; and &#8216;LFTU&#8217;.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Data collection</title><p>In this retrospective cohort study, data were collected by reviewing the treatment records and registers. To ensure data accuracy and completeness, trained researchers independently extracted information using a standardised data collection form. Discrepancies were resolved through double-checking by a second investigator. Eligible patient files were identified, and data were extracted into an electronic questionnaire using Epidata Manager (V.4.4.2.1, Epidata Association, Odense, Denmark). For each patient, sociodemographic data (age, sex, residence location), clinical data (TB history, weight, TB site and classification, site of follow-up), and laboratory data (microscopy or molecular test results, HIV status) were recorded. Patients were retrospectively followed according to the classification of the TB and the TB site: 6 months (new cases), 8 months (retreatment cases), 12 months (cases with neurological or bone involvement) to determine treatment outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed using R V.4.1.3.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages, while quantitative variables were summarised as median and 25th&#8211;75th percentiles. The &#967;<sup>2</sup> test was used to compare proportions, and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison of quantitative variables. Z-scores were calculated based on the WHO growth standards to assess nutritional status. These scores were used to classify children into different malnutrition categories, with a Z-score below &#8722;2 indicating malnutrition. The cumulative incidence of unfavourable outcomes was calculated as the proportion of children experiencing these events relative to the total number at risk. Annual proportions of unfavourable outcomes were calculated to assess temporal trends. To evaluate the temporal trend in unfavourable outcomes over the study period, we applied a Poisson regression model, with the calendar year as a continuous predictor and the number of unfavourable outcomes as the dependent count variable. To identify factors associated with unfavourable outcomes, univariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. Variables with a p&lt;0.10 in univariate analysis were included in a multivariate logistic regression model. Adjusted ORs (aORs) with 95% CIs were reported. A p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Study population description</title><p>Of the 901 children enrolled at JHY, 20 were excluded for the following reasons: 12 had no recorded age or gender and 8 were transferred out.

id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the treatment outcomes of children with TB in a high-burden setting in Cameroon over a 20-year period. Among the 881 children included, the cumulative incidence of unfavourable outcomes was 24.5% and there was a significant decline in the proportion of unfavourable outcomes over years. Key determinants of unfavourable outcome were residence outside the city where TB care is provided, unknown HIV status and retreatment for TB. These findings underscore the considerable burden of unfavourable outcome in paediatric TB, while also highlighting a progressive improvement over time. They emphasise the importance of identifying and addressing specific determinants in order to sustain and further enhance treatment success among children.</p><p>The proportion of unfavourable TB outcomes varied substantially over the two-decade study period. Between 2001 and 2005, the progressive increase observed, peaking at 45.0% in 2005 can be attributed to the initial challenges faced by the CDT at JYH, which began functioning in 2001. This includes high patient volumes (2500&#8211;3000 annually), lack of retention strategies, limited tracing of patients lost to follow-up and routine HIV screening in children with TB was suboptimal, increasing the risk of missed coinfections and treatment complications. The proportion of unfavourable outcomes drops to 14.3% in 2009. This overall downward trend was also supported by the Poisson regression model, which estimated a statistically significant annual decrease in the incidence rate of unfavourable outcomes over the study period. The series of national policy changes implemented, including the &#8216;Stop TB&#8217; strategy (2006&#8211;2015) and the subsequent &#8216;End TB&#8217; initiative (2015&#8211;2030) can explain this trend. These reforms contributed to improvements in TB management across Cameroon and particularly at HJY, through decentralisation of services, the establishment of new CDT, the recruitment of tracing officers and the integration of HIV/TB care with free antiretroviral therapy introduced in 2005. However, the variability in the decline may be linked to periodic shortages of TB medications during this time. The lowest proportions of unfavourable outcome among children were observed from 2019 onwards. This is after the introduction of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay for paediatric TB diagnosis in our setting, which likely enabled earlier detection and treatment, contributing to improved outcomes. In 2020, the proportion of unfavourable outcomes reached 7.5%. This may suggest an improvement in paediatric TB management. But it is likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely disrupted health services worldwide, including TB case detection and follow-up. In Cameroon, as in many countries, the pandemic led to reduced healthcare access, reallocation of resources to COVID-19 response and interruptions in TB services, resulting in under-reporting of cases.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Consequently, the observed decline in unfavourable outcome in 2020 may partially reflect a drop in TB notifications rather than true epidemiological improvement.</p><p>The cumulative incidence of unfavourable outcome in our study (24.5%) is consistent with previous studies conducted in Cameroon. Vukugah <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> reported a similar burden of unfavourable outcomes (20%) among children treated between 2018 and 2020 in the Centre Region.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In the North Region, Dodo Balkissou <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> reported a lower incidence (4%) of poor outcome among children treated between 2010 and 2016.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> That study was conducted during a period when TB services in Cameroon were undergoing major national reforms (including decentralisation of care and increased availability of antiretroviral therapy) which could have contributed to better programme performance. In Botswana (6.9%)<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and Ghana (9.3% and 17.4%),<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 15</sup></xref> the incidence was also lower. This variation may reflect differences in case severity, healthcare infrastructure and follow-up systems. As a national referral centre, JHY receives children with more advanced TB, unlike studies in Botswana and Ghana that included primary care settings where cases may be detected earlier.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The elevated rate of LTFU (19.8%) in our study can be explained by JHY&#8217;s role as a stabilisation centre: many children return to their local areas poststabilisation, where limited follow-up systems may hinder continuity of care. In contrast, countries like Botswana benefit from stronger healthcare integration, reflected in a much lower LTFU rate (3%).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> HIV prevalence among TB cases in our study (10.1%) was lower than in Botswana (22.8%) and comparable to Ghana (16.1%). Yet, despite its higher HIV burden, Botswana&#8217;s favourable outcomes likely result from better integration of TB/HIV services, broader ART access and nutritional support. In Cameroon, fragmented follow-up systems and limited healthcare infrastructure may amplify the negative impact of comorbidities like HIV on TB outcomes.</p><p>The unknown HIV status was a determinant of unfavourable outcome in this study. This result is consistent with results of Siamisang <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> in Botswana, where children with unknown HIV status had over twice the risk of experiencing unfavourable outcomes compared with those with confirmed HIV-negative status.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Similar results were reported in Ethiopia and Ghana, which emphasised the critical role of timely HIV testing and management in improving TB treatment outcomes.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15 17</sup></xref> One-third of children had an unknown HIV status in our cohort. This reflects potential gaps in systematic HIV screening and linkage to care, particularly in resource-limited settings. Moreover, delayed HIV diagnosis likely prevents early initiation of antiretroviral therapy and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, both essential to mitigating the risk of poor TB outcome. These findings underscore the importance of reinforcing HIV testing protocols in all TB centres, especially in peripheral or lower-resourced settings where unknown HIV status remains frequent.</p><p>The higher risk of unfavourable outcome was observed among children requiring retreatment, as previously reported in Botswana.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The retreatment status likely reflects an existing unbalanced risk factor of TB on the children or prior suboptimal adherence which may contribute to the development of another episode of TB. This factor has previously been associated with increased mortality.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18 19</sup></xref> Furthermore, in our study, living outside of Yaound&#233; (urban centre where TB care is provided) is a risk factor of unfavourable outcome. This suggests that children living far from urban centres or treatment centres faced greater challenges in accessing timely and continuous care, exacerbating their risk of treatment interruptions and LTFU. In Ethiopia and India, it was reported that LTFU was high in patients with rural residence, living further from the health facilities and following treatment and care at health centres.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20 21</sup></xref> It was observed that the risk of non-adherence to treatment was higher among those who had lived &gt;10&#8201;km from the facility due to economic constraints to back transportation costs (18). Similarly, a study from the Philippines indicated that patients who lived near the service area were retained more on care as compared with those living abroad.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Implementing enhanced counselling and patient tracking strategies through digital tools or community-based health workers, for example, could improve treatment adherence and outcomes. Furthermore, expanding decentralised paediatric TB services would allow children living in remote areas to access timely diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, mitigating the adverse impact of geographical barriers</p><p>This retrospective study has some limitations, including potential bias due to incomplete records and its limited generalisability due to its focus on a single national referral centre. However, this setting captures severe and complex paediatric TB cases, providing valuable insights into high-risk populations. The lack of reliable data on drug stockouts and the absence of systematically recorded adherence information, likely due to political sensitivities and programme constraints, limited our ability to assess their impact on outcomes. Drug susceptibility testing results were not available. While resistance to anti-TB drugs is relatively uncommon in children, this limitation could have affected retreatment decisions and unfavourable outcomes. Despite those limitations, the study is one of the longest-term analyses of paediatric TB outcomes in a high-burden African setting, with a robust dataset encompassing mortality, LTFU and treatment failure. By addressing high-risk groups and contextual factors, these results provide actionable evidence to guide targeted interventions such as systematic HIV testing, strengthened patient follow-up and improved access to care for rural populations. This contribution fills a crucial gap in paediatric TB data in Central Africa and offers practical insights relevant to similar resource-constrained settings aiming to reduce unfavourable treatment outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights the high burden of unfavourable outcomes in children treated for TB in Cameroon and identifies key determinants such as unknown HIV status, residence outside centre of treatment and retreatment status. Over the 20-year period, a gradual decline in the proportion of unfavourable outcomes was observed, reflecting encouraging progress in paediatric TB care. Strengthening routine HIV testing, expanding access to care in rural areas and tailoring retreatment protocols could significantly improve outcomes. These findings provide actionable evidence to guide national TB programmes and improve the quality of care for children in similar high-burden settings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Data availability free text:</bold> The datasets generated and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Patient consent for publication:</bold> Not applicable.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethics approval:</bold> Ethical clearance for the study was granted by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Yaound&#233; I (Reference No: 0195/UYI/FMSB/VDRC/DAASR/CSD) and authorisation to access patient data was obtained from administrative authorities of the JHY (Reference No: 0127/L/MINSANTE/SG/DHJY /nm).
