Antibiotic use is associated with side effects and the development of antibiotic resistance. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes are essential to mitigate this issue. Many countries, including Kosovo, an upper-middle-income country, have not yet implemented AMS programmes. The implementation of AMS in Kosovo is shaped by economic, social, technological and legal factors. However, it is the structural weaknesses within the health system that pose the most significant barriers. This study will examine the barriers and enablers for AMS programmes for URTIs in the primary care setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>We plan to employ a qualitative case study approach, comprising interviews and focus groups conducted at six primary care sites within Kosovo, as well as central health institutions. We will include diverse stakeholders involved or affected by AMS implementation, such as healthcare workers, patients and their representatives, and policymakers from the Ministry of Health. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research will guide the design of the study, data collection and analysis. We will use framework analysis to examine key themes within the domains of intervention characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, characteristics of individuals involved, the implementation process and other insights.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Kosovo Doctors Chamber (Reference No 122/2024), and we will adhere to good practice in terms of informed consent and data protection.

Thus, it is likely to have a significant and disruptive impact on care delivery in the future.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>Kosovo&#8217;s healthcare system wrestles with significant AMR challenges, particularly in primary care, where antibiotics are often unnecessarily prescribed for respiratory tract infections (RTIs). For example, a recent review of primary health settings in Kosovo reported the use of antibiotics in 65% of RTI cases. Currently, 25 antibiotics are prescribed in the country, with beta-lactams being the most commonly prescribed.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Issues of overuse were worsened by the pandemic, where a &#8216;just in case&#8217; mindset led to a sevenfold increase in antibiotic use.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes provide safe care, reducing overuse and ameliorating resistance.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> This includes promoting compliance with antibiotic guidelines, appropriate prescription and reducing antibiotic use and costs.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Despite its recognised importance and efforts to introduce guidelines in primary healthcare,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Kosovo has not yet implemented AMS programmes. Guidelines for developing and implementing AMS are widely available,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> but implementation has proven challenging across all levels of care and facility locations. Barriers to AMS implementation include a lack of resources, specialist support and access to education. In primary and rural healthcare settings, several barriers exist, including patient preferences, health education and diagnostic uncertainty. There are also issues resulting from limitations around the health centres, such as a lack of resources, including staff, trainers, laboratory support, time constraints and physician attitudes towards AMS.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8 9</sup></xref> Factors that can act as enablers include guidelines, AMS protocols and committees, leadership commitment, flatter health institution governance structures, prescriber accountability and training,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8 10</sup></xref> involving local champions, and flexible and relevant learning strategies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Organisational culture, sociopolitical influences, environmental context and behavioural challenges should also be considered.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p>A situational analysis using the Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental framework showed that factors impeding progress elsewhere are also relevant in Kosovo. The main barriers to AMS implementation identified were economic, social, technological and legal factors. Lack of financial resources for staff education, further training and access to strep tests emerged as major barriers, which have been recognised elsewhere.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Patient attitudes and culture are commonly identified as social barriers, which intersect with the ease of obtaining antibiotics without a prescription and the low level of public awareness regarding side effects and AMR.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Interview participants unanimously mentioned the lack of a health information system as a technical barrier.

The <italic toggle="yes">macro-</italic>level factors relevant to this study include national policies and guidelines, regulatory and legal frameworks, public awareness and behaviour, and healthcare system challenges. We will develop an in-depth analysis of diverse, relevant factors present at all levels using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science (CFIR). Specifically, our study aims to use the CFIR to examine the barriers and enablers for implementing and scaling up an AMS programme for URTIs in Kosovo. The qualitative findings generated through this process will directly inform the refinement and contextual tailoring of the AMS intervention by identifying barriers, enablers and stakeholder needs. This will help ensure that the intervention is both feasible and responsive to local implementation realities across different health system levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>We will employ a case study approach, using qualitative data collection and analysis to investigate the barriers and enablers of AMS implementation in Kosovo&#8217;s primary healthcare system. Although data will be collected from multiple sites, that is, Main Family Medicine Centres (MFMCs), the case itself is the AMS programme as a bounded intervention implemented within a defined national context (ie, Kosovo&#8217;s primary care system). This approach is consistent with the logic of single case study designs, as described by Yin,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> where a single intervention implemented in multiple settings can be treated as a single, holistic case. This is especially relevant when the focus is on understanding implementation processes, system-level barriers and contextual dynamics. The results will be interpreted in general terms using the constructs of the CFIR and will not be site-specific. The key benefit of this approach is its focus on the entire health system in Kosovo, rather than viewing each institution in isolation. This study protocol has been developed in accordance with the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR)<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies (StaRI).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Intervention</title><p>The Ministry of Health, with the support of the National Institute of Public Health of Kosovo (NIPHK) and other supporting institutions, in close consultation with primary care stakeholders and with funding and guidance from the International Centre for Antimicrobial Resistance (ICARS) in Denmark, have initiated an AMS intervention in primary healthcare in Kosovo. The intervention involves the rollout of a comprehensive multimodal AMS programme in selected primary care facilities across Kosovo (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). The intervention includes structural reforms, capacity building, diagnostic improvements, patient education and performance tracking. Guided by international resources and frameworks, the programme aims to enhance antibiotic prescribing and reduce AMR. An initial situation analysis guides the intervention (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). The implementation and impact of the intervention are assessed through barrier and enabler assessment studies, including a qualitative study reported in this protocol and a conjoint analysis study, which will be reported in a separate protocol, as well as a cost-effectiveness and cost-intervention study (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). The results will be disseminated through various channels (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Elements of AMS intervention.

We will use the CFIR to evaluate the AMS intervention retrospectively and to audit it prospectively, for example, to assess the potential for scaling up AMS. The CFIR includes five key components: intervention, outer setting, inner setting, characteristics of the individuals involved and the process.</p><p>Regarding the first domain, &#8216;innovation&#8217;, we will use the term &#8216;intervention&#8217; instead, as it is more applicable to our context, as CFIR allows for language replacements to better fit specific projects. This domain explores the intervention itself, including its source, the supporting evidence base, adaptability, trialability and complexity. The &#8216;inner setting&#8217; domain centres on structural characteristics, networks and communication within the healthcare organisation, including cultural factors, the implementation climate and the organisation&#8217;s readiness for implementation. Conversely, the &#8216;outer setting&#8217; domain is focused on external factors that may influence the implementation process, such as patient needs and external policies and incentives. The &#8216;individual characteristics&#8217; domain is focused on the knowledge and beliefs held by individuals regarding the intervention, their self-efficacy, their current stage of change, their alignment with the organisation and other personal attributes that may influence their involvement in the implementation process. Finally, the &#8216;process&#8217; domain examines the planning, engagement, execution, and reflection and evaluation phases of the intervention.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> We will add a further construct, &#8216;others&#8217;, for additional comments that the existing CFIR constructs may not cover.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Study sites</title><p>Data collection will take place in the MFMCs in Prishtina, Vushtrri, Klina, Lipjan, Ka&#231;anik and Gjakova, which are primary intervention sites. Control sites of the project will not be included, as the intervention in control sites begins later during the second part of the project&#8217;s implementation. Study site selection was based on a set of predefined inclusion criteria to ensure diversity, feasibility and alignment with project objectives. Eligible sites included the MFMCs distributed across various regions of Kosovo. Only those MFMCs whose directors formally committed to participation through signed agreements were considered. Administrative and clinical staff were expected to actively engage in the project, adopt new practices as needed, complete audit tools and report transparently. Preference was given to centres with prior experience in collaborative or international research, as they are typically better equipped to manage logistical and administrative demands. Additional inclusion criteria included the presence of appropriate facilities to support training on AMS, sufficient patient volume to reflect varied prescribing practices, and reliable maintenance of patient and prescription records to support data collection and analysis. Sites were also required to have the infrastructure to implement and sustain rapid diagnostic testing, such as strep tests. Finally, only MFMCs adhering to high ethical standards were included.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Recruitment and data collection</title><p>Data collection will take place over two&#8201;months during the implementation, from October 2025 to March 2026. Before data collection, we will distribute consent forms and participant information sheets to each respondent. The data collected during the sessions will be digitally recorded, and field notes will be taken throughout the process. We will employ multiple data collection methods (ie, semistructured interviews and focus groups) and engage diverse respondent types (ie, patients, community representatives and AMS team members) to enable methodological and data source triangulation. These strategies, combined with multiple researchers involved in the coding and interpretation, described below, are designed to enhance the credibility and depth of findings by capturing a comprehensive and multiperspective understanding of AMS implementation across stakeholder groups.</p><sec id="s2-5-1"><title>Semistructured interviews</title><p>Semistructured interviews will be used to collect data from key stakeholders. We opted for semistructured interviews, as they better align with the study design and the use of the CFIR framework.

However, data saturation will be a key criterion in determining the final sample. Recruitment of participants will continue until no new insights emerge, indicating that saturation has been reached. This will ensure that our study will collect a sufficient range of diverse perspectives.</p><fig position="float" id="F2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Stakeholders involved in semistructured interviews.</title></caption><graphic position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="bmjopen-15-8-g002.jpg"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-5-2"><title>Focus groups</title><p>We will explore the collective dynamics of AMS implementation through focus groups (4&#8211;8 participants) involving both care receivers and prescribers. These will be performed in the six previously identified sites in local settings. In each setting, we will conduct two focus groups, one with patients, patient representatives or relevant community members, and the other with local AMS team members, resulting in a total of 48&#8211;96 participants overall (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Stakeholders involved in focus groups.

This criterion will be interpreted in accordance with the role of each stakeholder in intervention implementation. For policymakers and health centre administrators, it refers to their supervisory or managerial responsibilities related to the programme and the delivery of care in intervention sites. For prescribers and other medical staff, it will entail active participation in the provision of care directly linked to the intervention. For beneficiaries, it will involve frequent use of services affected by the intervention, that is, consultations for URTIs, receipt of antibiotic prescriptions or exposure to educational materials, within primary care settings over at least 1 year. For suppliers, eligibility will be based on sustained involvement in delivering relevant materials or equipment to the intervention sites during the same period. In addition to this time-based criterion, participants will also demonstrate a working or assumed knowledge of the intervention or the services it influences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Guidelines for interviews and focus groups</title><p>A team of experienced researchers and AMS experts from Kosovo will develop the interview guide for interviews and focus groups, using questions adapted from the CFIR framework.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The questions will be open-ended and tailored to the relevant stakeholders. Interview questions will primarily elicit personal experiences and opinions, whereas focus group questions will examine different opinions, group dynamics and contrasts. Before data collection, we will test the guidelines with various stakeholders and make any necessary adaptations. When data collection begins, we plan to employ an iterative data collection process, where early focus group and interview transcripts will be reviewed for emerging themes and gaps. As a result, the guides will be refined to facilitate a more in-depth exploration of the key issues raised by participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Research team and reflexivity</title><p>The research team will comprise individuals responsible for designing the study, collecting data and conducting qualitative analysis. To address potential conflicts of interest and maintain analytic objectivity, researchers directly involved in delivering or managing the intervention will not participate in data collection or primary coding. Some senior investigators who contributed to the intervention&#8217;s design may provide input during later stages, that is, interpretation of findings or manuscript drafting. However, they will not be involved in the handling of raw data. To address reflexivity, all data collectors and analysts will be asked to write a brief positionality statement outlining their professional background, prior experiences with the topic and any relevant preconceptions. Additionally, practices such as maintaining journals and holding regular team debriefings will be used to surface and critically examine how these characteristics may shape data interpretation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Data processing and analysis</title><p>The interviews will be transcribed verbatim and analysed using framework analysis as an iterative approach. Two experienced researchers will independently examine the transcripts of the interviews and deductively code them using key CFIR constructs, such as &#8216;intervention&#8217;, &#8216;external context&#8217;, &#8216;internal environment&#8217;, &#8216;individual characteristics&#8217; and &#8216;the overall process&#8217;. In addition to the predetermined constructs from the CFIR, any additional themes or subthemes that emerge and are not covered by the framework will be considered for integration into the framework and categorised as &#8216;other&#8217;. Multiple researchers will be involved in the coding and interpretation of data to support investigator triangulation. Intercoder agreement will be assessed by having two independent coders apply the framework to the transcripts. We will ensure internal reliability by reviewing the coded transcript, checking coder agreement and resolving discrepancies, potentially using a third coder if necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>Patients and members of the public were not involved in the initial design or funding application for this study. We plan to involve patients in refining the interview and focus group guide to ensure its relevance and clarity. Patients will participate as stakeholders in both semistructured interviews and focus groups, and their input will be used to inform a potential scale-up of AMS throughout Kosovo.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Summary of the study design and aim</title><p>This study aims to support the implementation and scaling-up of an AMS programme in Kosovo.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13 14</sup></xref> We will use a qualitative case study approach to assess the barriers and enablers to AMS implementation in the context of a multimodal initiative focused on URTIs, developed jointly by ICARS and the NIPHK. We will collect data from central organisations and primary care facilities, using a combination of interviews and focus groups.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Relevance of the study</title><p>Our study is grounded in the CFIR, which offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the health system and informs both design and data analysis.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> To our knowledge, our study is the first to apply the CFIR framework to assess the barriers and enablers to AMS implementation; however, previous studies have employed alternative methods. For example, studies conducted in South Africa, Australia and Ethiopia have sought to explore potential barriers, enablers and knowledge among healthcare providers, employing thematic analysis, sometimes in combination with quantitative analysis.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Another example is the use of Normalisation Process Theory to assess AMS barriers and enablers in rural health services in Australia.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Our study will add to the existing approaches by broadening the focus to a whole health system, complete with external stakeholders (public, industry and government organisations) who interact with the health system.</p><p>Although our study will take place in the context of a particular AMS initiative aimed at URTIs, the use of the CFIR will provide more far-reaching insights, guiding policy and resource allocation and helping to realise improved antimicrobial utilisation, thereby achieving better health outcomes. Future initiatives to improve care and control of AMR can be carried out using actionable insights based on a more comprehensive understanding of the features that shape the healthcare landscape in Kosovo. Our study design can also serve as a template for implementing AMS both within and outside Kosovo, particularly in areas where AMS programmes are still emerging.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The study&#8217;s greatest strength lies in its systematic approach to assess factors influencing the implementation and scale-up of AMS for URTIs in Kosovo&#8217;s primary healthcare system. The study design, guided by the CFIR, incorporates a wide range of stakeholders, allowing for an in-depth and well-rounded understanding of the contextual and systemic factors influencing AMS across the <italic toggle="yes">micro, meso and macro</italic> levels. The use of this methodological conceptual approach, although widely employed in studies of various interventions, has been limited in examining the barriers and enablers of AMS interventions, especially in low-income countries. Similarly, the examination of the barriers to implementation using robust methodological frameworks remains limited. The larger number of participants, combined with interviews that focus on individual experiences and focus groups that examine group dynamics, will provide a multifaceted and rigorous view of the AMS programme.</p><p>As a qualitative study in a specific setting, our results may not be easily applied or routinely observed in other settings. The use of qualitative methods adds complexity to the data collection and analysis process. A common challenge in qualitative methods is the impact of subjectivity and the potential risk of bias in interpretation.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> To mitigate the risk of bias, two researchers will independently code the transcripts and resolve discrepancies through discussion to provide a refined understanding of the CFIR constructs. Operational challenges include coordinating data collection across multiple sites and stakeholder groups. This will require strong organisational management. The less structured nature of interviews and focus groups may introduce variability, necessitating careful analysis to ensure consistency and comparability of findings.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Ethics approval and dissemination</title><p>The investigators will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol, informed consent form, participant information sheet and advertising materials have been approved by the Ethics Committee at the Kosovo Doctors Chamber (16 August 2024, RN 122/2024). All participants in interviews and focus groups will be asked to read an information sheet outlining the study&#8217;s purpose, procedures and ethical considerations, and will be required to provide written informed consent before participation. No reimbursement is planned for participation in the study.</p><p>The research team will ensure that the participants&#8217; anonymity is maintained. Participants will be identified only by a participant ID number on all documents. Documents will be stored securely and will only be accessible to study staff and authorised personnel. The study will comply with the Data Protection Act, which requires data to be anonymised as soon as it is practical to do so.</p><p>We will primarily disseminate the results of this study in peer-reviewed journals to promote this novel methodology to other research teams.
