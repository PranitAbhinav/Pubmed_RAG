Previously at our centre, joint fluid aspirates often lacked crystal analysis, resulting in excess culture-negative septic arthritis diagnoses. We developed a &#8216;Hot Joint Pathway&#8217;, hypothesising that since acute crystal arthropathy can be misdiagnosed as &#8216;culture-negative septic arthritis&#8217;, introducing the pathway would improve diagnostic accuracy.</p><p>This pathway provides a structured approach for investigating acutely swollen joints, distinguishing septic arthritis from crystal arthritis. Key features include a secure messaging app for multidisciplinary discussion and rheumatology-led point-of-care polarised light microscopy (POC PLM) &lt;24&#8201;hours 6&#8201;days per week. A service evaluation of hospital inpatient data identified patients labelled with septic arthritis admitted between two periods: before (1 January 2019&#8211;30 November 2020) and after (27 September 2022&#8211;29 February 2024) pathway implementation. Emergency department (ED) patients discussed via the app were also analysed (27 September 2022&#8211;25 September 2023).</p><p>Among ED patients, 92% received rheumatology input, and 100% underwent joint aspiration with rheumatologist-led crystal analysis in &lt;24&#8201;hours. 68% avoided hospital admission, receiving same-day discharge. Of these, 53% were diagnosed with crystal arthropathy and were discharged with planned outpatient follow-up.</p><p>Diagnostic accuracy increased for inpatients following pathway introduction. Joint aspirates increased from 50% to 76% (p=0.034). Culture-negative cases of septic arthritis reduced from 34% to 17% and culture positive cases increased from 41% to 76% (p&lt;0.005). Crystal analysis increased from 19% to 28%. Positive blood cultures increased from 28% to 41%. Mean length of stay decreased from 26 to 23 days.</p><p>A structured care pathway combining rheumatology-led POC PLM and multidisciplinary discussion increases diagnostic accuracy, facilitates admission avoidance and reduces hospital stay for patients with acute swollen joints. Rheumatology-led PLM is essential for the success of this pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Arthritis</kwd><kwd>Clinical Decision-Making</kwd><kwd>Continuous quality improvement</kwd><kwd>Emergency department</kwd><kwd>Evidence-Based Practice</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001637</institution-id><institution>Trinity College Dublin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Academic Track Internship Programme</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC</title></caption><sec><title>WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS</title><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>Integration of rheumatologist-led POC PLM into a structured care pathway for use in the emergency department rapidly identified crystal arthropathies.

Point-of-care (POC) polarised light microscopy (PLM) to detect monosodium urate (MSU) and calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals is the gold standard for diagnosis of crystal arthropathy, as outlined by both the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 2</sup></xref> Rheumatologist-led POC PLM can rapidly diagnose a crystal arthropathy, facilitating discharge with a management plan. In contrast, cases of septic arthritis are diagnosed by positive synovial fluid cultures, which take days to yield results and require admission for intravenous antibiotics and potential arthroscopic washout.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>Despite guidelines advocating for rheumatologist-led crystal analysis, considerable variation in practice remains and crystal analysis is often omitted in the investigation of acute swollen joints in the emergency department (ED) and inpatient setting.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The lack of POC PLM for these patients often results in unnecessary admissions for empirical intravenous antibiotics while awaiting culture results to confirm septic arthritis.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Multiple studies have reported that crystal arthropathy is often misdiagnosed as septic arthritis, with one analysis finding that gout patients were 2.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with septic arthritis and subject to potentially unnecessary admission and intravenous antibiotics compared with controls.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p>Our study describes the development and implementation of a &#8216;Hot Joint Pathway&#8217;, which aimed to improve the diagnostic accuracy of acute swollen joints by incorporating rapid access rheumatologist-led POC PLM into a structured workup. Our aim was to improve patient outcomes by rapidly identifying crystal arthropathies that would otherwise have been treated as culture-negative septic arthritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Baseline measurement</title><p>Rheumatologists in our institution frequently received consultation requests for patients diagnosed with culture-negative septic arthritis, often after intravenous antibiotics had been initiated. We observed that aspiration of synovial fluid with rheumatology-led POC PLM was often omitted from initial investigations. This was clinically significant because many of these cases met the criteria for crystal arthropathy.</p><p>A baseline audit of hospital inpatient enquiry (HIPE) data identified 35 patients admitted with a label of septic arthritis from 1 January 2019 to 30 November 2020. Three miscoded cases were excluded. POC PLM and diagnostic accuracy were assessed. Culture-negative septic arthritis cases were defined as cases where synovial fluid or tissue cultures were negative or reported as contaminants with subsequent negative samples. Of the 32 patients identified, only 6 patients were assessed with PLM. Patient charts were reviewed by a rheumatology specialist registrar. Nine patients were identified where an alternative diagnosis to septic arthritis was more likely, seven of whom were nonetheless treated for septic arthritis with intravenous antibiotics without a positive joint or blood culture. Four of these patients had features consistent with a diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) arthritis, with a further two highly suspicious for a diagnosis of gout.</p><p>To further assess diagnostic accuracy, we reviewed 26 cases that underwent crystal analysis by both rheumatology-led POC PLM and the hospital laboratory (1 December 2021&#8211;1 October 2024). The laboratory took a mean average of 5.6&#8201;days whereas rheumatology-led POC PLM reported results in &lt;24&#8201;hours (p&lt;0.00001). 46% (12/26) of cases were reported as negative for crystals by the laboratory but reported positive when analysed by a rheumatologist. Of these, 11 cases were positive for CPP crystals. Overall, inconsistencies were found in 16/26 of cases, with CPP crystals often omitted from laboratory reports. Cohen&#8217;s kappa coefficient (&#954;=0.0) indicated no agreement beyond chance, and McNemar&#8217;s test (p=0.0078) confirmed a statistically significant difference in diagnostic classifications between the two methods. This unpublished preliminary study further emphasised the value of implementing rheumatologist-led POC PLM for efficient and accurate diagnoses of acute swollen joints.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Design and strategy</title><p>Our baseline inpatient audit highlighted diagnostic inaccuracies, particularly in culture-negative septic arthritis cases. Since acute hot joints present to the ED, we focused efforts on improving diagnosis at the initial point of presentation. Stakeholders from rheumatology, ED, infectious disease and orthopaedics collaborated via four in-person meetings and regular email communication to establish best practice for management of acute swollen joints in the ED. This group included consultants and trainees from each specialty to ensure a variety of perspectives were considered. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats analysis identified barriers to introducing a &#8216;Hot Joint Pathway&#8217; which helped troubleshoot difficulties. Two major Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-based (SMART) aims were agreed on: (1) develop a novel, multidisciplinary and timely approach to manage acute swollen joints in the ED and (2) reduce the number of inpatients with a discharge diagnosis of culture-negative septic arthritis. Key guidelines, including the French recommendations on the management of septic arthritis in the adult native joint, guideline for management of septic arthritis in native joints, ACR/EULAR Gout Classification criteria and EULAR recommendations for diagnosis of crystal arthropathy were used to benchmark and standardise the pathway.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 2 8 9</sup></xref> In light of this, rheumatologist-led POC PLM was included with an aim for sample analysis within 24 hours 6&#8201;days per week, with faster turnaround during daytime hours. To ensure accurate crystal analysis, the pathway required red-compensated PLM with a circular rotating stage, as used in our hospital, to assess birefringence and eliminate artefacts. Studies have reported significant interobserver variability of MSU and CPP crystal identification depending on the level of training of laboratory staff or rheumatologists.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 2 10</sup></xref> Therefore, only rheumatology specialist registrars or consultants trained in PLM were incorporated into the &#8216;Hot Joint Pathway&#8217;.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p>Real-time consultant-led case discussion was essential for timely PLM and discharge decisions. We implemented Siilo, a free secure medical messaging app which complies with all European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) healthcare security and compliance requirements, to facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration (figure 4). Many doctors were already using Siilo for secure communication within our hospital, minimising the need for behavioural change.</p><p>The final consensus led to the development of the &#8216;Hot Joint Pathway&#8217; which included: (1) baseline blood cultures, (2) early joint aspiration before antibiotic administration where clinically appropriate and (3) real-time case discussion via Siilo to organise rheumatologist-led PLM within 24 hours 6&#8201;days per week (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>, figure 4). In cases of &#8216;dry taps&#8217; or suspected tenosynovitis, ultrasound-guided joint aspiration was considered and multidisciplinary decision-making was supported via Siilo. Other key elements of the pathway were followed where feasible. We collaborated with our hospital&#8217;s IT department to integrate the pathway into our &#8216;patient centre&#8217; software, which is used by staff to review clinical information. This enabled easy access and promoted awareness for those reviewing patients in the ED.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The &#8216;Hot Joint Pathway&#8217;.

The initial cycle showed a decrease in patients recruited to the pathway after the 3&#8201;monthly staff changeover. Therefore, ED-led teaching sessions were implemented after each changeover to sustain awareness and adherence of the pathway.</p><p>A reaudit of inpatients admitted with a label of septic arthritis was completed after the pathway had been introduced. The pathway was launched on 27 September 2022. 32 cases admitted between 27 September 2022 and 29 February 2024 were identified and 3 were excluded for incorrect coding. Key outcomes such as rheumatologist-led POC PLM, blood cultures, joint aspirations, synovial culture and length of stay were assessed. Cases were also reviewed independently by two consultant rheumatologists to assess the diagnostic accuracy of septic arthritis cases.</p><p>Fisher&#8217;s exact test was applied to categorical variables to assess differences in proportion. Continuous data were assessed using a bootstrapped independent t-test. A p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.
