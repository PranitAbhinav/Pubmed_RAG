BED is often poorly understood and under-represented in research, despite high prevalence. It is unclear how self-harm in BED populations compares to rates of self-harm in other eating disorder populations or control groups. A systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken with the aim of investigating how often self-harm occurs along with BED compared to other eating disorders and control groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p id="Par2">The protocol for this review was pre-registered (PROSPERO reference: CRD42023466201). Online databases, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Web of Science, were searched using key terms relating to BED and self-harm, for publications dating up to February 2025. Inclusion criteria were studies that measured BED and self-harm. Titles, abstracts and full texts were screened by independent screeners. Sixteen studies were identified. Meta-analyses were completed to determine the odds of self-harm in BED groups compared to other eating disorders and non-clinical control groups. Risk of bias and publication bias were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">There was no difference in rate of self-harm between people experiencing BED compared to those experiencing Anorexia Nervosa (Odds Ratio [OR]&#8201;=&#8201;0.7, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]&#8201;=&#8201;0.4&#8211;1.2) or Other Specified Feeding and Eating Disorders (OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.7, 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.4-1.0). Self-harm was 1.6 times more likely in BED groups compared to non-clinical controls (OR&#8201;=&#8201;1.6, 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;1.0-2.5), and almost half as likely compared to Bulimia Nervosa groups (OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.6, 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.4&#8211;0.8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">BED is associated with a higher prevalence of self-harm compared to non-clinical populations and should be approached similarly to other eating disorders in this regard. Increased awareness of the potential for self-harm in BED groups is vital to ensure interventions for eating disorders integrate self-harm prevention. Further research is required in non-western communities and across sexes and gender identities.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40337-025-01379-8.</p></sec></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><p id="Par5">Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is a common but often poorly understood mental health problem. There is some evidence that people experiencing BED often also self-harm. This review investigated how BED and self-harm co-occur, compared to self-harm in other eating disorders. Sixteen studies were identified that investigated BED and self-harm. Self-harm in those experiencing BED did not significantly differ to those who experience Anorexia Nervosa or Other Specified Feeding and Eating Disorders. Self-harm was a lot more common in BED groups than people who do not experience an eating disorder, and a lot less common compared to people who experience Bulimia Nervosa. In conclusion, BED co-occurs with self-harm and should be given similar care as other eating disorders. Most studies identified were based in Western female populations. More research is needed in non-western populations and across sexualities and gender identities. Being more aware of self-harm rates in BED groups helps to improve the care available. It is vital treatments for those who experience BED also consider self-harm prevention.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40337-025-01379-8.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Binge eating disorder</kwd><kwd>Self-harm</kwd><kwd>Eating disorders</kwd><kwd>Systematic review</kwd><kwd>Meta-analysis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par6">Eating disorders are a major health concern worldwide with an estimated 1.7% of the world population experiencing an eating disorder in their lifetime, with even higher rates in Western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Eating disorders can cause great distress and physical health issues, leading to reduced wellbeing and high economic cost to the individual and wider economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) has the highest prevalence of any eating disorder, with an estimated 1.5% of the world population affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. BED is characterised by recurrent episodes of binge eating in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ([DSM], 4), meaning to eat a large amount of food quickly. The binge is associated with a sense of loss of control, feeling uncomfortably full, distress, shame and disgust. Importantly, BED is not associated with compensatory behaviours, such as fasting, purging or over exercise. Similarly to other eating disorder diagnoses, self-harm is often seen in people who experience BED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], but it is unknown how self-harm in BED compares to other eating disorders or those without eating disorders.</p><p id="Par7">The impact of BED is significant, with almost all (94%) of those experiencing BED reporting lifelong mental health difficulties such as low mood, substance misuse, anxiety and experiences of trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. BED has been associated with increased physical health needs, difficulties in work/school, impacts on social lives and reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Despite this, almost half (49%) of those experiencing BED never seek help for their distress, particularly if male or from an ethnic minority group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. BED is commonly unrecognised, misdiagnosed and underrepresented in clinical and research settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Stigma around higher weight or body fat levels linked to binge eating cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and an expectation a person must be underweight to experience an eating disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] has been suggested as factors that contribute to missed BED diagnoses by clinicians. People of higher weights who experience BED face high levels of stigma in western cultures, through social media and by the weight-loss food industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Alongside stigma, high levels of trauma and disability in BED groups may lead to diagnostic overshadowing and missed eating-related distress, further biasing researchers and clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Research into the impact of BED is vital to improve understanding and support for those affected.</p><p id="Par8">The evidence base consistently suggests eating disorders and self-harm commonly co-occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the rates of eating disorders and self-harm co-occurring are rising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Self-harm is defined as any self-injury or self-poisoning, regardless of suicidal intent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It&#8217;s estimated 40% of individuals experiencing an eating disorder also self-harm, and 22% attempt suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Individuals experiencing any type of eating disorder are almost seven times more likely to self-harm than healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The systematic review and meta-analysis by Kirkpatrick and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] calculated pooled prevalence estimates for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) across eating disorder diagnoses. Across diagnoses a prevalence of 35% for lifetime NSSI was reported (79 studies), whereas for BED (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;9) a slightly lower estimate of 21% was calculated. This remains higher than general population estimates of NSSI prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The relationship between BED and self-harm remains unclear, however. Whilst self-harm may result from BED, for example as a response to associated distress, it may also be that a history of self-harm increases the risk of BED, for example if binge eating develops as an alternative to self-harm serving a similar function, such as regulating difficult emotional states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Both BED and self-harm may also arise from common causal factors, accounting for their co-occurrence. Reviewing the extant literature concerning the association between BED and self-harm may help elucidate the nature of any association. Self-harm is a robust risk factor for later suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] associated with premature loss of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], further increasing risk in this group alongside the impact of BED. Consequently, even where the causal link between BED and self-harm remains unclear, understanding the relative risk of self-harm (past or current) in those with BED compared to other groups is important in considering the clinical needs and risks in this population.</p><p id="Par10">Several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses focus on the prevalence of self-harm in eating disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, these reviews do not separately estimate the association for different ED diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or only focused on Anorexia Nervosa (AN) or Bulimia Nervosa (BN; 15). Many of these reviews only compared people experiencing BED to healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or made no comparisons at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To compare BED groups to other eating disorders is vital to determine the level of clinical need and risk across these populations, which in turn can inform service and intervention development.</p><p id="Par11">This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate rates of self-harm in people who experience BED, and how this compares to other eating disorder populations, as well as other clinical and non-clinical populations. Studies that included data on the occurrence of self-harm within people with BED and within other comparator groups, allowing for a comparison to made, were included. No specific hypotheses were generated, however. To our knowledge, the current systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to focus on the association of BED and self-harm. The present review focuses specifically on comparing the odds of self-harm in people with BED to other populations. Previous review have reported on the (non-comparative) prevalence of self-harm in BED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of systematic review</title><p id="Par12">The systematic review and meta-analysis were prepared and completed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis was pre-registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number CRD42023466201). Two deviations were made. First, meta-analyses were conducted with at least three studies available (rather than five as noted in the protocol). This change was made to make the most use of available data. Second, initially we intended to also look at self-harm related thoughts as well as behaviour, but this plan was later dropped to give the review greater focus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study eligibility</title><p id="Par13">To be eligible for inclusion, studies must have included a measure of BED and a measure of self-harm. BED is characterised by episodes of binge eating without compensatory behaviours, consistent with DSM criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Measures of BED could include self-report, clinical interview, outcome measure or diagnosis. Studies that included other types of eating disorders were eligible for inclusion if the study provided data for a BED group separately. Studies were required to specify (or be able to provide this information on request) the presence of a given BED diagnosis, which is not equivalent to binge eating behaviour or symptoms, as binge eating is also present in other eating disorders. Measures of self-harm could include frequency or history. Studies were excluded during screening if they were not written in English (as resources for translation were unavailable), do not use original data (e.g. other reviews) or use only qualitative methodology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Search strategy</title><p id="Par14">PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Web of Science electronic databases were searched from February 2025 to earliest available records.

If studies reported multiple sub-diagnoses (e.g. AN restricting type and AN binge/purge type), diagnoses were collapsed into over-arching diagnosis type to ensure meaningful comparison with other studies.</p><p id="Par21">For the purposes of this meta-analysis, a decision was made to include Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) and Other Specified Feeding and Eating Disorder (OSFED) diagnoses as one group.

To separate EDNOS and OSFED diagnoses would not be a meaningful separation and would limit meta-analysis statistical power.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par22">Analysis was completed in R Version 4.4.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] with the <italic toggle="yes">meta</italic> package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A series of random-effects meta-analyses were used to compare study outcomes (i.e., presence of self-harm) between those experiencing BED and other groups, where <italic toggle="yes">&#8805;</italic>&#8201;3 studies were available. Groups with less than three studies were not entered into a meta-analysis as this would add little value with so few studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Separate meta-analyses were completed for different comparator groups (e.g., control groups or other eating disorder diagnoses). We initially planned to also undertake separate meta-analyses for different time periods (e.g. lifetime, past year, past month), however the large majority of studies provided data on lifetime self-harm only. As such meta-analyses were only undertaken focussing on lifetime self-harm, and individual studies that focused on other time periods are discussed separately.</p><p id="Par24">Self-harm can encompass both suicidal and non-suicidal behaviours. Where a study only reported on one form of self-harm (e.g. NSSI) these data were used in the meta-analyses. Where a study reported data on NSSI and suicide attempt separately, and it was not possible to calculate the overall frequency self-harm (i.e., whether someone had engaged in either NSSI or suicide attempt), further information was requested from authors (provided by authors for one study). If no response was obtained the data for NSSI was used in meta-analyses (this was done for one study). NSSI was the most commonly reported form of self-harm and as such we undertook a post-hoc sensitivity analysis, re-running meta-analyses just using NSSI as the outcome.</p><p id="Par25">A random effects model was used due to expected heterogeneity in the studies in terms of design, location, and measurement. Odds Ratios (Ors) were used as the metric of effect size. The I<sup>2</sup> statistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] was used to determine and interpret the percentage of effect size variability that is not caused by sampling error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. For all analyses, raw frequencies were entered directly into R to run analyses. Forest plots were produced to visually present results. Risk of publication bias was assessed using funnel plots for meta-analyses. Only meta-analyses with ten or more studies were assessed using funnel plots as recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A p value of &lt;&#8201;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Screening</title><p id="Par26">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the data identification and screening process (PRISMA diagram).

A common risk of bias throughout the studies included using unvalidated measures of self-harm. The frequent use of unvalidated single item binary questions increased the risk of bias for over or underestimation of self-harm. A further common risk of bias included a lack of adequate descriptions of participants&#8217; demographic characteristics. Inadequate descriptions of demographic characteristics limit our understanding of the results, particularly in relation to missing ethnicity and socioeconomic data. Furthermore, risk of bias was present by assessors often not being blind to participants&#8217; eating disorder diagnoses (or a lack of clarity on this). A lack of blinding may lead to biased outcomes, as assessors are open to make assumptions or misinterpret data in the light of their knowledge about the participant. There were some risks of bias identified with participant selection, such as online support groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] or self-selecting student populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], but most used consecutive referrals to eating disorder services.

Firstly, two studies (<italic toggle="yes">k&#8201;=</italic>&#8201;2; 44, 52) focused on self-harm over the past year (rather than lifetime). These studies were not included as an individual may have engaged in self-harm longer than 1-year ago, but within the lifetime, meaning the timeframes were incomparable. One study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] recruited participants diagnosed with borderline personality disorder that had taken part in a randomised control trial looking at. The study reported lower rates of past year self-injury in the BED group (71%; <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;5) compared to those with AN or BN (75&#8211;89%). Although the BED group still experienced more self-injury than those without a comorbid ED 67% (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;74).

Another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] recruited through online eating disorder support groups.

These differences were reported as statistically significant, but it is important to note the very small samples in eating disorder groups (e.g. BED group <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;1). This study also reported on suicide attempts specifically (in addition to a general question about harming oneself) but reported no suicide attempts across diagnostic groups having occurred during the term.</p><p id="Par43">One study investigated eating disorder diagnosis ARFID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] in participants recruited from an eating disorder service. This study found 0% of those identified as experiencing ARFID (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6) engaged in NSSI whilst one had made a suicide attempt. This result should be interpreted tentatively given such a small sample size.</p><p id="Par44">Two studies investigated frequency of self-harm in BED groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, these papers used different measures of frequencies in BED groups, reporting a binary response to &#8216;5 or more&#8217; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and &#8216;0, 1, 2+&#8217; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

The most common types of self-harm in BED groups were reported as self-cutting in 66.7% of the BED group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and picking at a wound in 49% of the BED group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. These studies used different approaches to assess self-harm method and therefore could not be reliably compared.</p><p id="Par45">There were two longitudinal studies. One investigated self-harm and BED over 12 years (<italic toggle="yes">k&#8201;=</italic>&#8201;1; 53). The study recruited participants who were admitted for inpatient treatment and followed up 12-years later using a psychiatric interview to determine the level of improvement in ED symptoms. Bivariate associations were found between self-harm at baseline and ED related outcomes at follow-up, but none of these effects remained significant whilst adjusting for other baseline variables. This study did not control for variation in ED symptom severity at baseline, which is a limitation. A second study used data from a larger-scale longitudinal survey of young people in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. BED (assessed over two waves and modelled as a time-varying predictor) was not associated with self-harm occurrence at the following wave. Whilst the overall sample was large (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;&gt;&#8201;4,000) the number with BED was relatively modest, however (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;30&#8211;60), which will have affected power.</p><p id="Par46">Three studies provided mixed results regarding lifetime suicide attempts in ED patients and students. In one suicide attempts occurred at a slightly higher prevalence in BN (36%) and AN (42%) groups than BED (11%; 48). Another in students likewise reported attempts were more common in the BN (22%) and AN (14%) groups compared to BED (4%; 54). In contrast the other study reported suicide attempts were more common in the BED group (27%) than BN (12%) or AN group (15%; 42). These studies are all limited by small participant numbers, however.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par47">This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the co-occurrence of self-harm in people experiencing BED and compared this to the presence of self-harm in other eating disorders and non-clinical samples. This review extended knowledge from recent reviews that identified prevalence of self-harm in people experiencing BED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Results suggested that individuals experiencing BED have 1.6 times the odds of also experiencing self-harm in their lifetime compared to non-clinical controls and did not significantly differ from AN or EDNOS/OSFED. However, the odds of self-harm were less likely in BED groups compared those experiencing BN.</p><p id="Par48">The present review further added to the current knowledge base (e.g., 5, 15, 16), by comparing BED to AN, BN, EDNOS/OSFED and non-clinical control groups. No other reviews to our knowledge investigated these comparisons. These comparisons are particularly important as they indicate that self-harm remains a risk in BED populations, to a similar extent to other eating disorder populations such as AN and EDNOS/OSFED. As the majority of studies focused on lifetime self-harm, and did not explore the timing of events, it remains difficult to elucidate the nature of the relationship between BED and self-harm. For example, it is not clear if self-harm typically precedes or co-occurs with BED. Longitudinal studies were scarce. There was evidence that self-harm was associated with poorer outcomes in BED (though not when adjusting for other factors) and in one study BED was not predictive of later self-harm. There was evidence from two studies that self-harm within the past year was common in BED samples. Self-harm typically serves a function (e.g. regulation of emotions, communication of distress; 21) and so may be a response to distress and impairment arising from BED. It is also possible that binge eating behaviours develop after self-harm in some people as an alternative means of regulating negative emotions, replacing self-harm. There is evidence that binge eating in BED may be triggered by negative affect and could serve an emotion-regulation function, although support for the latter claim has been mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The typical age of onset for BED has been reported as the late teens or early twenties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] which is similar to self-harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">Self-harm in the past is a robust predictor for future self-harm risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], and so even if self-harm predates a BED diagnosis this might be indicative of ongoing future risk of self-harm. As self-harm is a strong clinical indicator of later suicide and premature loss of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the findings of this systematic review suggest that clinicians should be mindful of the risk of self-harm within BED populations. It is important that risk in BED groups is not underestimated, and is treated equally to other eating disorders, to ensure support is in place to prevent self-harm and suicide. These findings also further highlight the need for a better understanding of BED, given its high prevalence in comparison to other eating disorders but underrepresentation in research and clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">The risk of self-harm was lower in those with BED compared to BN. This is in line with previous research. A large meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] found higher prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury in BN groups (37.0%) than BED groups (21.2%). The present review furthered this finding by comparing these groups directly, which had not previously been investigated. The difference in self-harm in BED compared to BN groups may be explained by differences in the extent of negative self-referential emotions and emotional regulation difficulties. In comparison to BED groups, BN groups report more extreme eating disorder cognitions in response to &#8216;feeling fat&#8217; related emotions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], greater emotional regulation difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] and high levels of self-hate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Supressing emotions and lack of access to emotional regulation tools predict self-harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], and emotional dysregulation mediates the relationship between self-hate and self-harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], which may explain why BN groups have higher odds of self-harm. Whilst both BED and BN groups face high levels of stigma, BN groups often face higher levels of blame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], likely further contributing to high levels of distress. Additionally, according to the acquired capability perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], the exposure to purging (i.e., a high level of physical pain) may weaken the fear of self-harm or suicide, and/or self-harm may weaken the fear of purging, which may further explain the higher odds of self-harm in BN groups compared to BED groups observed in this review. Notably, a large UK based longitudinal survey of young people found BN was significantly associated with greater odds of self-harm at later waves (adjusted OR&#8201;=&#8201;5.72) further supporting the link between BN and self-harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">The studies in this review were often biased to female and western populations. Representation of male or transgender individuals in eating disorder research is often low, despite increasing rates of eating disorders in these groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Unfortunately, the present review cannot contribute to this under-represented area, given a lack of original studies investigating BED in these populations. Additionally, most studies included took place in Europe and the USA. Other reviews suggest high prevalence of eating disorders in Asian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] African and indigenous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>], Middle Eastern, Eastern European and Latin American communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The present review did not find any studies that investigated self-harm and BED in these populations, though this may be explained by excluding non-English language studies. The present review illustrates the disproportionate representation of western communities in eating disorder research. Furthermore, the studies included did not frequently present demographic data such as ethnicity, sexuality, neurodivergence or socioeconomic status, further limiting our understanding and generalisability of the results.</p><p id="Par52">The methods used by identified studies to assess outcomes may also limit our interpretation of the results. Most studies measured presence or absence of BED by an unspecified clinical interview or a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Previous research has suggested healthcare clinicians have difficulty identifying BED, influenced by barriers in healthcare systems and stigma often linked to higher body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This may be reflected in the studies identified in the present review, with most recruiting more participants experiencing BN, despite BED being estimated as the most common eating disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Missed diagnoses may be a systemic issue, influenced by the lack of research in BED compared to AN and BN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It is therefore possible many individuals experiencing BED were not accurately captured by the included studies.</p><p id="Par53">Self-harm was commonly measured as a binary variable over the lifetime. This method limits our understanding of the frequency, causes, change over time and nature of the self-harm. The scarcity of longitudinal research further limits our understanding of temporal characteristics of the relationship between BED and self-harm. Studies that consider the timing of self-harm in relation to BED are required to better elucidate their relationship. Some included studies in this review utilised standardised questionnaires, but ultimately binary presence or absence of self-harm was presented as a primary outcome.</p><p id="Par54">This area of research may be at risk of publication bias. As seen in funnel plots for BED vs. AN, and BED vs. BN meta-analyses, there was some indication that amongst smaller studies those with more pronounced effect sizes were more likely to be published. Whilst potentially problematic, it is unlikely this has had a substantial impact on the results given the smaller weighting of these studies within meta-analyses.</p><p id="Par55">The present review excluded studies that were not written in English, meaning otherwise eligible studies from different countries may have been excluded. However, it was noted that only four studies were excluded (over title, abstract and full text screening) for being in a language other than English. It is also recognised that while no limitations were placed upon non-published pieces of work, further efforts could have been made to capture work outside of peer reviewed journals. During the search process, it was noted a significant number of studies investigated binge eating behaviour but not BED (as seen in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As binge eating behaviours feature across other types of eating disorders, these studies were not included. Further research should aim to investigate the association that binge eating behaviour more broadly has with self-harm. This may give further understanding of binge behaviour and how this may link to other risk behaviours such as self-harm.</p><p id="Par56">The present review included no analyses of moderators. Although small, some heterogeneity was observed between studies which may have been explained by moderator analyses. However, the small number of studies in many of the analyses would have meant moderator analysis would have been underpowered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Likewise, due to small numbers of studies entered into meta-analyses, BED vs. non-clinical controls and BED vs. EDNOS/OSFED could not be assessed for risk of publication bias. Whilst it is important to complete only meaningful funnel plot analyses with ten or more studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], the results remain limited by our understanding of publication bias for these meta-analyses. Due to uncertainty when planning the review about what comparisons would be possible given the available literature, no hypotheses were generated, which is a further limitation.</p><p id="Par57">The DSM diagnostic criteria for eating disorders was updated in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The studies included were published before and after this update. The present review did not look at differences between this time point in diagnostic change, which may have affected results and methods used by the studies. As those experiencing BED are more likely to experience self-harm compared to the non-clinical populations, it is imperative that clinical services regularly screen for self-harm in BED populations and provide effective interventions that target both eating disorder behaviours and self-harm behaviours. As Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is recommended in the treatment of BED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] and for self-harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], it is recommended psychotherapies offered to this population include cognitive-behavioural aspects. Further research is needed to understand the efficacy of CBT and other therapies in clinical settings for co-occurring BED and self-harm. Effective interventions may be limited by the lack of recognition and understanding of BED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] compounded by the scarce research in this area. Issues with the recognition and understanding of BED may mean self-harm risk is also not identified, which increases risk of further distress and suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The present review contributes to the existing literature indicating thar BED is as concerning as other eating disorder diagnoses in terms of self-harm. It is hoped this finding contributes to removing stigmas around BED to recognise the great distress associated with this eating disorder.</p><p id="Par58">This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that lifetime self-harm is more prevalent in people who experience BED compared to non-clinical control groups but does not differ significantly to AN and EDNOS/OSFED groups. Notably self-harm was lower in BED compared to BN. This review highlights a crucial gap in our understanding of those experiencing BED. To better support this population, future research should investigate the causes and patterns of self-harm in BED groups, including the temporal characteristics of this relationship, to inform effective interventions, improve access to services and help reduce stigma experienced by those experiencing BED.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1238" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
