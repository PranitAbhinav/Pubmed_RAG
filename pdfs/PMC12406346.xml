It manifests with varying severity, resulting in significant morbidity, poor quality of life, and premature death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. During pregnancy, SCD can become more severe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Early reports on the outcome of pregnancy in women with SCD showed a nearly universally negative outcome for mother and child. Based on the findings of a meta-analysis, pregnancy among individuals with SCD is linked to a higher likelihood of intrauterine growth restriction, premature birth, abnormal fetal heart rate and intrauterine fetal death, low birth weight, anemia, infection, preeclampsia, and higher risk of the cesarean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Still, the outcome has dramatically improved with advances in medical care, particularly the introduction of pre-conception care (PCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. </p><p id="Par10">The occurrence of sickle cell trait and SCD in southern Iran is estimated to be 1.43% and 0.1%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. From our clinical point of view, as a common disease in Iran, particularly in Hormozgan province [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and due to high maternal mortality of SCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], paying attention to this group of society and conducting the necessary studies to reduce the mortality of pregnant mothers is one of the health priorities of the province. Recently, the maternal health administration in Iran developed a comprehensive PCC used for pregnant women with SCD. One of the essential steps to have a normal pregnancy is to perform PCC, and since expectant mothers with SCD are more at risk due to pregnancy changes, performing PCC in this group is essential, and all efforts should be made to maximize the participation of this group in PCC. Healthcare facilities in Iran provide comprehensive services for women with SCD with a particular focus on risk assessments, including checking the individual&#8217;s general health status, modifying lifestyle, prescribing supplements, and providing specialized medical consultation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. </p><p id="Par11">However, it should be kept in mind that before designing any intervention to increase participation in PCC, questions about the target group, such as &#8220;What is their level of involvement in PCC? What is their level of awareness and attitude? What is their health opinion on SCD? How can they be encouraged to become more engaged in PCC?&#8221; Answering such questions will lead to a better understanding of the target group and the existing infrastructure for intervention design. For this purpose, this study was conducted to explain the PCC among women with SCD based on the health belief model (HBM). The HBM can describe how health-related beliefs and factors influence maternal behaviors, aiding in the prediction of a woman&#8217;s likelihood of adhering to PCC. It is crucial to inquire about women&#8217;s health beliefs regarding PCC as this informs the creation of nursing and midwifery interventions that can influence hospital guidelines and provide assistance to women navigating decisions about PCC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par12">A cross-sectional study was conducted in Hormozgan province, the southern region of Iran, with a high prevalence of SCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] from March 2021 to June 2021.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sampling</title><p id="Par13">All women of reproductive age with SCD living in Hormozgan province willing to participate in a study were included. Illiterate and mentally disabled individuals were unable to participate in the study because they could not respond to the questionnaire. Women with SCD were selected through a systematic sampling framework using the Iranian integrated health system. The Iranian integrated health system is national for recording, updating, and maintaining Iranian household health data. This national system keeps every Iranian family member&#8217;s vital medical information and disease records. The integrated health system associated with each university can share individual information with authorized users from the university and research team members to conduct research and monitor the health status of individuals, with approval from the university&#8217;s code of ethics.</p><p id="Par14">We searched for records of each woman&#8217;s records on the integrated health system using the keyword SCD to identify eligible individuals. All women of reproductive age with SCD were contacted by phone and asked if they planned to have a baby. Those with positive answers were invited to participate in the study after a comprehensive explanation of the purpose and process of the study; informed consent was taken from the eligible participants.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Evaluation instruments</title><p id="Par17">Given that no existing standard questionnaire was available, a questionnaire was developed by the research team based on public databases and the results of other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information from participants. A demographic questionnaire, knowledge questionnaire, HBM questionnaire, and pre-conception activities questionnaire were used in this study. The questionnaires used in this study, including the original version in Farsi and an English translation, can be accessed as supplementary files. (Supplementary file 1)</p><p id="Par18">The HBM Questionnaire, a 49-item questionnaire with six subscales, was created to assess participants&#8217; health beliefs about SCD and pre-conception activities. The HBMQ severity subscale was a seven-item, five-point Likert-type scale that asked women whether they thought SCD was a severe condition (e.g., &#8220;Maternal and fetal complications increase if I did not PCC&#8221;). The response options ranged from &#8220;strongly agree&#8221; to &#8220;strongly disagree&#8221;. The scale scores ranged from 5 to 35, with higher scores indicating that SCD was perceived as a more significant threat.</p><p id="Par19">The HBMQ susceptibility subscale was a 10-item, five-point Likert-type scale that asked each woman to consider what she thought was true about an SCD in her situation (e.g., &#8220;Pregnancy can be risky even for a young woman with SCD&#8221;). The response options ranged from &#8220;strongly agree&#8221; to &#8220;strongly disagree&#8221;. The scale scores ranged from 10 to 50, with higher scores indicating a higher perceived risk of SCD.</p><p id="Par20">The HBMQ barrier subscale used an eight-item, 12-point Likert-type scale to assess women&#8217;s perceptions of barriers to PCC (e.g., &#8220;PCC is expensive&#8221;). Each item&#8217;s response options ranged from &#8220;strongly agree&#8221; to &#8220;strongly disagree.&#8221; The scale scores ranged from 12 to 60, with higher scores indicating a more excellent perception of barriers to obtaining prenatal care.</p><p id="Par21">The HBMQ benefits subscale used a seven-item, five-point Likert-type scale to assess women&#8217;s perceptions of the benefits of pre-conception care. Women were asked to consider what they thought was true about the benefits of pre-conception care (e.g., &#8220;By participating in PCC, I will know the right time to get pregnant &#8220;). Each item&#8217;s response options ranged from &#8220;strongly agree&#8221; to &#8220;strongly disagree.&#8221; The scale scores ranged from 7 to 35, with higher scores indicating that pre-conception care was perceived to have greater benefits in preventing SCD adverse events.</p><p id="Par22">Women&#8217;s self-efficacy, a woman&#8217;s perception of her ability to get PCC, was measured using a 10-item five-point Likert-type scale in the HBMQ (e.g., &#8220;I can participate in PCC activities&#8221;). The answer choices ranged from &#8220;strongly agree&#8221; to &#8220;strongly disagree&#8221;. Scale scores ranged from 10 to 50, with higher scores reflecting higher self-efficacy for accessing pre-conception care.</p><p id="Par23">Cues to action, which refer to the factors that help individuals make health-related decisions, were conceptualized as triggers for engagement in pre-conception activities. Advice from relatives, friends, and healthcare providers as an external trigger and the reasons for the necessity of participation in pre-conception care from the patient&#8217;s point of view as an internal motivation is a crucial factor guiding women to participate in pre-conception care. Cues to action were measured using the HBMQ subscale. Women were asked to answer &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221; to the role of others in deciding to participate in pre-conception care.</p><p id="Par24">The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 18 multiple-choice questions (e.g., &#8220;Preterm birth is common in pregnant women with SCD?&#8220;). The answers were &#8220;Yes,&#8221; or &#8220;No,&#8221; or&#8221; Do not know&#8221;. Correct answers received one point each, and not knowing the answer or incorrect answers received no points. Possible scores, therefore, ranged between 0 and 18, with a higher score indicating more awareness.</p><p id="Par25">To assess PCC adoption, we asked them about their adoption of 12 commonly recommended behaviors regarding SCD based on standard guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] during the study period. The activities included taking 5&#160;mg of Folic acid, avoiding smoking, achieving a normal BMI, performing lab tests, vaccination, cervical cytology test, dental visit, avoiding contact with cats, discontinuing Hydroxycarbamide three months before conception, visiting a hematologist, genetic screening, and retinal screening. The answers were &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221;.</p><p id="Par26">The demographic factors of each participant, including age, education, occupation of both women and their spouses, and socioeconomic status, were recorded in a simple questionnaire.</p><p id="Par27">A team of nine experts in field health education, epidemiology, obstetrician, and reproductive health was responsible for the validity and reliability of the questionnaire. Minor amendments were made to the wording and order of the questions to achieve a more logical layout. A pilot study was conducted with 30 women to test the items&#8217; comprehensibility and establish the questionnaire&#8217;s reliability. The overall Cronbach&#8217;s alpha coefficient of the pilot study ranged from 0.69 to 0.91, indicating that the instrument had a high internal consistency.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par28">The results were analyzed using SPSS software (version 25). Mean and standard deviation were used to provide descriptive statistics of quantitative variables, and frequency and percentage were used for qualitative (categorical) variables. The results of quantitative variables were reported as mean, standard deviation (S.D.), or frequency (percentage). The relationship between demographic variables and the behavior of participating in PCC has been investigated through a one-way analysis of variance. Pearson&#8217;s correlation test was used to investigate the relationship between variables. We tested the effect of health beliefs on PCC by using a path analysis model, in which the observed HBM variables predicted PCC behavior. We chose path analysis because building a model with path coefficients allows for simultaneously estimating causal relationships among all variables and examining the model&#8217;s goodness of fit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The goodness-of-fit index (GFI) was used to assess the model&#8217;s explanatory power, and the adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI) was used to delineate its stability. Furthermore, the comparative fit index (CFI) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) were used as indicators of relative fitness. Previously, values indicating model acceptability were specified as 0.9 for GFI and AGFI, 0.1 for RMSEA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and 0.95 for CFI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We used the Eq.&#160;6.1 software for pathway analysis. The <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 was considered as significant.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par38">The study&#8217;s main goal was to investigate women&#8217;s adopting PCC, which included performing or not performing a set of health behaviors. The critical point is that taking care of health before pregnancy is difficult because unplanned pregnancies are common in our society. A meta-analysis examined 49 articles in Iran, with a total sample size of 43,061 cases, to determine the prevalence of unintended pregnancy, which was found to be 30.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, healthcare providers have always regarded PCC as an ideal health behavior.</p><p id="Par39">Demographic factors have always been influential in deciding whether or not to engage in healthy behavior. Several factors, including age, marital status, insurance coverage, education, employment status, and family income level, are effective in adopting PCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A study conducted in Ethiopia on the general population found that young women with higher education are more willing to commit to PCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Another study also in Ethiopia found that marriage and living with a partner are deciding factors in receiving PCC among women of reproductive age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Some studies pointed to people&#8217;s economic status as an important reason for not receiving PCC, so people who were uninsured or living in poverty did not receive PCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. </p><p id="Par40">Our findings indicated a relationship between the individual&#8217;s education and the spouse&#8217;s education with PCC, which means that people with a high education or spouses with a high education were more involved in PCC. Such results have been reported in previous studies. A study conducted in Malaysia on 1347 women of reproductive age showed that participation in PCC increased four times in women with higher education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Another study in Nigeria also pointed out that there is a relationship between women&#8217;s education and PCC, so PCC was more common in women with higher education than women with less education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Most studies have pointed out that educated people are more aware than people with less education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. </p><p id="Par41">In line with previous studies, our findings revealed a strong correlation between the knowledge of participants and the level of participation of people in PCC, implying that the higher the level of knowledge of people, the higher the level of involvement in performing PCC. The path analysis also revealed that women&#8217;s knowledge was strongly influenced by adopting PCC. Evidence similar to this finding can be found in the literature review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. </p><p id="Par42">However, knowledge solely is not the only factor predicting behavior change. Health education experts have presented proven effective and valuable models by incorporating various psychological and social science theories to change behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The HBM is one of these models. According to this theory, two critical factors influencing the adoption of desirable health behavior are the individual&#8217;s perception of the threat of disease and the belief that the benefits of adopting a protective health behavior outweigh the costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A group of psychologists proposed this model to explain why some people use health care while others do not.</p><p id="Par43">According to several studies, perceived severity is an important factor influencing a person&#8217;s decision to engage in or refrain from a health behavior. For example, a survey of 200 women in Ghana revealed that perceived severity was the most influential factor in increasing the number of people participating in cervical cancer screening tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Another study on 400 men aged 40&#8211;70 found that men with a higher perceived severity score were more likely to participate in prostate cancer screening tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In contrast, a study on the relationship between health belief model structures and colorectal cancer screening in a population over 70 years old found that a higher perceived severity score played no role in screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In our study, a significant relationship existed between people&#8217;s perceived severity and adopting PCC.</p><p id="Par44">According to the HBM, behavior change will only happen if an individual believes they are at risk of maintaining their current behavior. This condition is called perceived susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]according to the study&#8217;s hypothesis, people who believe they are more at risk due to SCD are more likely to seek PCC. Our findings revealed a significant relationship between people&#8217;s perceived susceptibility and their participation in PCC. This means that people who believed SCD could have serious consequences were more willing to participate in PCC. The path analysis also revealed that perceived susceptibility strongly influenced adopting PCC. The importance of perceived susceptibility as a practical construct in performing a health behavior such as colorectal cancer screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]breast cancer screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]HIV testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]and PCC in overweight and obese women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] has been demonstrated in several studies. Perceived susceptibility is a common construct in many health behavior theories, and it has been identified as the driving force for engaging in health behavior in various studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Researchers disagree on the mechanism by which perceived susceptibility influences behavior. Some believe that perceived susceptibility directly affects behavior. This viewpoint is reflected in the HBM, which includes only the direct effects of model components on behavioral outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Others, however, believe that perceived susceptibility does not directly cause a person to decide whether or not to adopt a behavior but acts as a mediator alongside other factors, such as perceived benefits as a stimulus for creating a behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. According to Fishbein&#8217;s integrative model, perceived sensitivity influences intention and behavior indirectly via mediating variables such as attitudes, mental norms, and self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Regardless of different points of view, what is important is that perceived susceptibility plays a vital role in creating behavior, and any intervention that can change this component can play a role in performing or not performing a healthy behavior.</p><p id="Par45">Self-efficacy is one of the most important determinants of behavior. According to our findings, self-efficacy had the highest correlation with PCC. The path analysis also revealed that perceived self-efficacy had the most substantial influence on adopting PCC. Consistent with our findings, a study of 165 pregnant women found that participation in prenatal care was significantly higher in those with a higher self-efficacy score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Many studies have highlighted the significance of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy links a person&#8217;s way of thinking and intention and the occurrence of specific behavior. Self-efficacy was mentioned as a key element in choosing the delivery method and controlling the fear of natural delivery in Khorsandi et al.&#8216;s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The study by Darsareh et al., comparing primiparous pregnant women who chose natural delivery versus women who chose cesarean section, found that self-efficacy is the most important factor influencing the choice of delivery method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. </p><p id="Par46">Perceived benefits are another important factor in deciding whether or not to engage in health behavior. The term &#8220;perceived benefits&#8221; refers to a person&#8217;s belief about the effect of the recommended behavior on risk reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The current study&#8217;s findings indicated a relationship between perceived benefits and participation in PCC. Many studies have found that perceived benefits are important in performing specific health behaviors such as breast cancer screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and colorectal cancer screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, studies such as Dersareh et al.&#8216;s study on the relationship between perceived benefits and delivery method choice revealed that, even though primiparous women valued natural delivery more than cesarean section, they chose the cesarean delivery method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. </p><p id="Par47">Perceived barriers refer to a person&#8217;s perception of the tangible and intangible costs of the recommended behavior, on which a person bases his understanding of the obstacles he will face in performing the target behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Among the obstacles that may lead to not adopting a behavior are a lack of time to complete a task, high costs, an inability to pay for that behavior, or a lack of necessary facilities to perform that behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The current study found a relationship between perceived barriers and PCC. However, the correlation level of this construct with people&#8217;s participation in PCC was lower than that of other HBM components. As a result, it can be stated that the participants in this study reported few obstacles to performing PCC.</p><p id="Par48">In addition to the components mentioned above, some external (caused by the environment outside of the person) or internal (caused by the person) events can cause the person to perform the target behavior. These stimuli are the action guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which in this study refers to the role of the healthcare providers and medical centers. According to the data analysis, midwives, gynecologists, and healthcare providers were identified as the most important sources of information. In addition, the appropriateness of costs, the availability of comprehensive health centers, and the fear of maternal complications during pregnancy were among the factors reported as incentives to perform PCC by women with SCD.</p><p id="Par49">As with any study, this study is not without limitations. Selecting only one behavior theory (HBM) is considered a limitation of this study. Since the health belief model is person-centered and does not investigate the environmental factors that influence people&#8217;s behavior, using other behavioral and educational theories, such as the theory of planned behavior, could have produced better results. The sample size may also affect the generalizability of the findings. A larger sample size can increase the generalizability of the results. Although it should be noted that in the case of certain diseases such as SCD, the prevalence of which is high in the province but small compared to other conditions, they can effectively determine the sample size. However, in the case of certain diseases, such as SCD, the prevalence of which is high in the province but low in comparison to other conditions, they can be influential in determining sample size. As is the lack of causal inference between the variables used in this study, using a cross-sectional design is debatable. Because the study relied on self-report measures, social desirability might have influenced the participants&#8217; responses. Illiterate individuals and those with mental health disorders were not included in the study due to their inability to complete the questionnaires. These limitations should be taken into account when designing similar studies in the future. Despite the limitations, our study is the first to use key constructs from the health belief model to explain PCC among women with SCD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par50">Knowledge, perceived susceptibility and self-efficacy are the most important determinants of performing PCC.
