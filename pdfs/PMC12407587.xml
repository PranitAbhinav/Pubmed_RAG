Doppelg&#228;nger pairs also bias statistical tests and distort microbial network topology. In predictive models, classification accuracy was artificially boosted by 15&#8211;30% points across KNN, SVM, and Random Forest classifiers. In association testing, doppelg&#228;ngers increased false-positive rates and decreased effect size stability; their removal reduced bootstrap variance by up to 28.3%. Moreover, the removal of doppelg&#228;ngers yielded more stable networks. These effects were consistently observed across 16S, shotgun metagenomic, and simulated datasets. By accounting for highly similar samples, we reduce analytical noise and false discoveries, ultimately enabling more accurate and biologically meaningful microbiome insights.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Microbiome</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>doppelg&#228;nger</kwd><kwd>pre-processing methodology</kwd></kwd-group><support-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Singapore Ministry of Health&#8217;s National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOH-001353</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Centre for Microbiome Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>022154-00001</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wang Lee Wah Memorial</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This research is supported by the Singapore Ministry of Health&#8217;s National Medical Research Council under its CS-IRG [MOH-001353] and OF-LCG [MOH-001573, MOH-001326, MOH-001793-00] schemes, the NTU Start Up Grant [021337-00001, 021281-00001], Centre for Microbiome Medicine [022154-00001], and Wang Lee Wah Memorial Fund.</funding-statement></funding-group></support-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><ref-count count="23"/><page-count count="1"/><word-count count="5790"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" disp-level="1" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human microbiome is a complex and diverse community of microorganisms inhabiting various body sites and has emerged as a crucial factor influencing human health<sup><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Studies indicate a critical connection between dysbiosis of these microbial populations and a range of diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC)<sup><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)<sup><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, obesity<sup><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, and even mental health disorders<sup><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. While our understanding of the microbiome has grown significantly, many aspects remain unexplored, necessitating further research. This ongoing investigation heavily relies on microbiome profiling, underscoring the critical importance of developing novel preprocessing methods to enhance data quality and analysis.</p><p>Microbiome profiling typically involves sequencing of specific genetic markers, or whole metagenome shotgun sequencing for a comprehensive assessment of the microbial community and its functional potential. From the sequencing process, the resulting data is represented as a matrix, with samples and microbial features (e.g., operational taxonomic units [OTUs] or functional genes) denoted as columns and rows, respectively. Matrices are amendable for a variety of analyses, including statistics and machine learning modeling. However, microbiome datasets, even when represented in matrix form, pose unique challenges for analysis due to high-dimensionality, sparsity, and over-dispersion issues<sup><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>One critical aspect that is often overlooked is the presence of highly correlated or duplicate samples within the same class (e.g., control or case), referred to as &#8220;doppelg&#228;nger pairs.&#8221; These pairs can introduce biases and confound the results of downstream analyses, particularly when applying machine learning techniques for disease classification or biomarker discovery<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. This phenomenon has been previously described and studied on other omics platforms, such as proteomics and transcriptomics, highlighting its relevance across various biological data types. Notably, previous studies have reported that the presence of doppelg&#228;nger pairs in datasets can dramatically inflate accuracy metrics, causing random simulations where the expected average accuracy is around 50% to rise to nearly 100%<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Doppelg&#228;nger pairs represent a form of data leakage, where the model may learn to recognize specific samples rather than underlying patterns. This can result in over-optimistic performance estimates during internal validation.</p><p>The phenomena of doppelg&#228;nger effects, i.e., how doppelg&#228;nger pairs confound analysis, have never been studied in the microbiome. Hence, we propose to 1) identify doppelg&#228;nger pairs in microbiome data using standardized protocol<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>; 2) assess the impact of doppelg&#228;nger pairs on machine learning model performance; 3) evaluate the influence of doppelg&#228;nger pairs on downstream analyses, specifically statistical association tests and network analysis; 4) provide recommendations for handling doppelg&#228;nger pairs in microbiome data preprocessing to ensure data integrity and enhance the reliability of subsequent analyses.</p><p>By addressing doppelg&#228;nger effects, we aim to contribute toward the development of more robust and reproducible methods for microbiome data analysis, ultimately advancing our understanding of the microbiome&#8217;s role in human health and disease.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0002"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="s0002-s2001"><title>Identification of doppelg&#228;nger pairs</title><p>Doppelg&#228;nger pairs were identified via the published protocol of Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><sup><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. This process involved first calculating the Pairwise Pearson&#8217;s Correlation Coefficients (PPCC) between samples. Sample pairs were then grouped based on class labels, e.g., case and control. A correlation cutoff derived from the maximum correlation observed between any case and control sample pair was established. Doppelg&#228;nger pairs were identified based on this cutoff. Specifically, sample pairs originating from within the same class, i.e., case&#8211;case and control&#8211;control, with correlations that exceeded the established cutoff were classified as doppelg&#228;ngers. This method systematically pinpointed highly correlated samples within each class. We also used the software implementation and tutorial to ensure fidelity to original process (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7080539" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7080539</ext-link>)<sup><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p><p>To quantify pairwise similarity between samples, we evaluated three correlation measures: Pearson&#8217;s, Spearman&#8217;s, and Kendall&#8217;s correlation coefficients. While Pearson&#8217;s correlation was selected as the primary method for doppelg&#228;nger identification due to its sensitivity to linear similarity, we also computed Spearman&#8217;s and Kendall&#8217;s correlations to ensure robustness across different assumptions. All correlation matrices were computed using base R functions, with rank-based correlations implemented for comparative assessment (Supplementary box 1).</p><p>The maximum cutoff approach uses the highest correlation value observed among between-class pairs as the threshold for identifying doppelg<bold>&#228;</bold>ngers. This conservative strategy ensures that any within-class correlation exceeding this threshold represents a degree of similarity that is biologically impossible to achieve between different disease states. We validated this approach using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess distributional differences between between-class and within-class correlation groups, and visualized the separation using histograms to demonstrate the biological rationale underlying the cutoff selection.</p><p>Alpha and beta diversity were also conducted to identify functional and biological characteristics differentiating the doppelg&#228;nger group and non-doppelg&#228;nger group. Bray&#8211;Curtis distance was used to compute beta diversity between doppelg&#228;nger and non-doppelg&#228;nger samples in the CDI cohort. Relative abundance transformation was performed, where raw counts were normalized to proportions. We used permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to compare the variance between groups in complex multivariate data. Here, PERMANOVA tests for statistically significant difference in species composition between the doppelg&#228;nger and non-doppelg&#228;nger groups.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="s0002-s2002"><title>Population</title><p>We observed recurrent instances of doppelg&#228;nger pairs across various digestive diseases. These include CRC<sup><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, IBD<sup><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, <italic toggle="yes">Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection (CDI)<sup><xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, and obesity<sup><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. These diseases were chosen due to their established association with alterations in the gut microbiome. Our selection spanned a spectrum of digestive diseases, from those with a direct, well-characterized connection to gut microbial composition, such as IBD and CDI, to conditions like CRC and obesity, where microbial links are significant but less direct. By including diseases both directly and indirectly related to gut microbiome changes, we aimed to provide a comprehensive view of microbial dynamics across various digestive health scenarios. This allowed for explorations of established microbiome-disease associations and offered insights into the nuanced roles of gut microbes in complex conditions such as CRC and obesity. The diversity of diseases selected in this study enhances the generalizability of our findings, thus contributing to a deeper understanding of the gut microbiome&#8217;s role in digestive health and disease.</p><p>Our datasets were extracted from the comprehensive MicrobiomeHD database<sup><xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Our selection criteria prioritized studies with the largest sample sizes. Notably, for IBD and CRC, we expanded our analysis to include studies with smaller sample sizes to ensure comprehensive coverage. Additionally, we generated simulated datasets to further examine IBD-specific microbiome patterns.</p><p>To evaluate the generalizability of our doppelg&#228;nger identification method to shotgun metagenomic datasets, we applied it to publicly available data from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi-omics Database (IBDMDB, also known as HMP2; <ext-link xlink:href="http://ibdmdb.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://ibdmdb.org</ext-link>), comprising 1,638 stool metagenomic samples from patients with IBD and non-IBD controls.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="s0002-s2003"><title>Study design on machine learning models</title><p>The study design assumed that a well-generalized machine learning model exhibits robust performance across various train-test splits. However, even with balanced train-test splits, without investigating the pairwise correlations of samples, the doppelg&#228;nger effect could significantly impact the model&#8217;s accuracy. Specifically, when highly correlated sample pairs existed in both training and validation sets, they inflate model performance in a dosage-dependent manner<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. To illustrate this, we use a schematic: In the baseline scenario, all doppelg&#228;nger pairs were placed within the training set, thus eliminating expected doppelg&#228;nger effects in the validation set. Progressively, as shown in <xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, we increased the number of doppelg&#228;nger pairs split between the training and validation sets.

KNN, a simple non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, classifies new data points based on the majority class of their &#8220;k&#8221; nearest neighbors in the training dataset. It assumes that similar data points are close to each other in feature space, making it effective for classification and regression tasks with well-separated data. KNN was selected due to its sensitivity to sample point proximity, effectively illustrating accuracy inflation from doppelg&#228;nger pairs. Therefore, with doppelg&#228;nger pairs present, KNN predictions could become overly optimistic, as the model &#8220;remembered&#8221; these pairs instead of learning generalizable patterns.</p><p>While our initial implementation focused on the KNN algorithm, we extended our evaluation to include support vector machines (SVM) and random forest classifiers to ensure that the observed effects were not model-specific. KNN was chosen initially for its strong sensitivity to local sample similarity, which makes it particularly prone to performance inflation from highly similar sample pairs. To more rigorously assess model performance beyond simple accuracy, we incorporated additional evaluation metrics including the F1 score and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). These metrics provide a more nuanced assessment of classification quality, particularly under class imbalance or when detecting subtle patterns in microbiome data.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="s0002-s2004"><title>Study design on network analysis and association test</title><p>Since the IBD data has the highest occurrence of doppelg&#228;nger pairs, we focus on studying this cohort to evaluate the severity of doppelg&#228;nger effects and its downstream impact on association test and network analysis<sup><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. For the association test, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was employed to compute the statistical significance of each OTU&#8217;s correlation with the disease. The primary objective was to deepen the understanding of the dynamics in microbiome downstream analysis after removing potentially influential sample pairs. In the network analysis, visualization techniques were used to transform microbiome data into a network structure, where each node represented an individual microbe, and edges indicated correlations exceeding a threshold of 0.7. Subsequently, the network underwent an &#8220;attack,&#8221; where nodes were randomly removed one at a time and this process was repeated iteratively until no nodes remained. Global network attack simulation was conducted to evaluate changes in network characteristics before and after removing doppelg&#228;nger pairs by measuring the average path length and average clustering coefficient. The average path length measures the average shortest path between all pairs of nodes in the network. The average clustering coefficient was used to measure the likelihood of a node&#8217;s neighbors being interconnected, indicating network fragility.

Although clustering coefficients naturally decline with node loss, we observed a more gradual decrease in the network without doppelg&#228;nger pairs.

id="s0004"><title>Discussion</title><p>As machine learning continues to grow in its application to microbiome data analysis, the integrity and representativeness of the datasets used for training and evaluation become increasingly critical. This study introduced a novel approach to enhance data quality by identifying and mitigating a specific form of data leakage: the presence of highly correlated sample pairs, referred to as doppelg&#228;nger pairs. These pairs present two major concerns when inadvertently split between training and validation datasets.</p><p>First, the redundancy of information inherent in doppelg&#228;nger pairs compromises sample independence and artificially inflates the apparent size and diversity of the dataset. This can lead models to &#8220;memorize&#8221; rather than generalize, distorting the learning process. Second, and more crucially, when doppelg&#228;nger pairs appear in both training and validation sets, they violate the assumption of independence between these partitions, resulting in inflated performance metrics that do not reflect true predictive capability. In other words, the presence of doppelg&#228;ngers causes information leakage and overestimates model accuracy, ultimately threatening the reproducibility of results. We developed a data-driven approach to identify these pairs using Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient with a relative cutoff derived from inter-group similarity. This method proved effective across various datasets and data types, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomics (e.g., IBD datasets from HMP2), and simulated microbiome data. We observed that doppelg&#228;nger pairs are more prevalent in disease states like IBD and CDI, where inflammation or treatment may drive microbiome convergence among patients, compared to CRC or obesity, where microbial alterations are more heterogeneous.</p><p>To evaluate the effects of doppelg&#228;nger presence on predictive modeling, we initially used a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier, given its sensitivity to sample proximity. We showed that as the number of doppelg&#228;nger pairs split between training and validation sets increased, model accuracy was significantly inflated. To ensure our findings were not model-specific, we extended our analysis to include SVM and random forests. Across all models, we observed consistent patterns of inflation, confirming that the phenomenon is not algorithm-dependent. Moreover, instead of relying solely on accuracy, we evaluated model performance using additional metrics such as F1 score and area under the ROC curve (AUC), which confirmed the same inflation trend. These results underscore the importance of careful data partitioning and quality control in microbiome machine learning studies. Importantly, our method is designed to augment rather than replace standard cross-validation. While cross-validation aims to provide robust performance estimates by rotating training/validation partitions, it assumes independence between samples. By removing doppelg&#228;nger pairs before cross-validation, we preserve this foundational assumption and improve the trustworthiness of downstream evaluations.</p><p>Beyond predictive modeling, we found that doppelg&#228;nger presence also affects biological inference. Association tests conducted on data with doppelg&#228;nger pairs showed a greater number of statistically significant results. However, when these pairs were removed, p-values for most OTUs increased, and the number of significant associations dropped. We interpreted this as a reduction in false positives rather than loss of signal. In fact, after doppelg&#228;nger removal, several biologically relevant genera emerged that were previously undetected, including <italic toggle="yes">Blautia</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Bilophila</italic>. These findings suggest that eliminating sample redundancy can uncover more biologically meaningful associations that may otherwise be obscured by spurious signals.</p><p>To further explore the stability of association results, we implemented a bootstrapping approach. We found that the variance in log-fold changes decreased by approximately 10&#8211;20% after removing doppelg&#228;nger pairs, indicating improved consistency of estimated effects. While we do not claim to identify &#8220;true&#8221; associations, this reduction in variability suggests enhanced reliability and robustness of statistical inference following doppelg&#228;nger removal. The increased stability is a desirable property that supports the use of doppelg&#228;nger detection as a quality control step in association testing. Additionally, we examined the impact on microbial co-occurrence networks. Network robustness, measured via average path length and clustering coefficient, improved after doppelg&#228;nger removal. These changes reflect enhanced topological stability, which may be important for downstream ecological or systems biology analyses. While we acknowledge that structural stability does not guarantee functional or biological relevance, it reduces the likelihood that results are driven by redundant or biased sampling.</p><p>Limitations of our study include the potential loss of true biological signals when removing doppelg&#228;nger pairs. While our method is conservative by design, future work could explore more nuanced strategies, such as weighting highly similar pairs or incorporating them into model regularization rather than outright removal. Additionally, applying our method to multi-omics datasets could provide deeper insights into the functional consequences of doppelg&#228;nger-driven redundancy.</p><p>In conclusion, our study highlights a previously underappreciated source of bias in microbiome machine learning and presents a generalizable strategy for improving data quality. By incorporating doppelg&#228;nger identification and removal into the preprocessing pipeline, researchers can enhance both predictive validity and biological interpretability of their models. As the field advances, addressing subtle data artifacts like doppelg&#228;nger effects will be essential for building reproducible and trustworthy microbiome-based tools.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study on doppelg&#228;nger effects in microbiome data analysis. We find that accounting for data doppelg&#228;ngers during the preprocessing stages of microbiome data analysis is essential and overlooked. Specifically, we recommend incorporating doppelg&#228;nger pair identification as a quality control step at the conclusion of the preprocessing pipeline in microbiome data analysis. This leads to less inflated machine learning modeling outcomes, and ultimately, toward better insights in how the microbiome contributes or is affected by diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM8151" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplementary_0811.docx</title></caption><media xlink:href="KGMI_A_2554196_SM8151.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>R.Z. analyzed the data, conceptualized the study, and was the primary contributor to writing the original draft.
