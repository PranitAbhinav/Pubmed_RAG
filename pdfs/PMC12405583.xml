However, despite their central function in the induction of adaptive immune responses, the kinetics and molecular regulation of the cDC life cycle and migration remain poorly understood. Using a variety of in vivo techniques, we examine the kinetics of cDC turnover in the intestine and address the molecular changes throughout the various stages of the cDC life cycle &#8211; from tissue entry and differentiation to CCR7 upregulation and subsequent migration into draining LNs. Our data demonstrate that the life cycle of gut cDCs is highly dynamic, characterised by continuous alterations in transcriptome, protein expression and proliferation rates. These progressive changes culminate in cDC homeostatic activation and migration resulting in a resource-intensive daily turnover of up to a quarter of intestinal cDCs and an almost complete daily replacement of the migratory cDC compartment in the mesenteric LN. This high turnover rate ensures that the mesenteric LN maintains an accurate reflection of the intestinal immunological state, supporting rapid adaptation to emerging immune challenges.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Conventional Dendritic cells (cDCs) continually migrate from peripheral tissues in homeostasis.

In particular, cDCs are indispensable for priming of na&#239;ve T cells and determine the qualitative nature of the ensuing immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As such, cDCs represent the key link between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.</p><p id="Par4">cDCs are present in all tissues and are continuously replenished from pre-cDCs circulating in blood. Pre-cDCs are dedicated haematopoietic precursors which differentiate into functional cDCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. cDCs comprise two phenotypically and functionally distinct subsets, cDC1 and cDC2, which sample the local environment via the expression of subset-specific endocytic and sensing receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. After a period of tissue residency, cDCs undergo a process mostly referred to as maturation or activation and switch to a state of decreased antigen uptake and enhanced antigen presentation capacity, characterised by increased surface expression of MHCII and costimulatory molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Importantly, they also upregulate the CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 7, which is required for cDCs to egress peripheral tissues, enter draining lymphatics and transport peripheral antigens to the local draining lymph nodes (LNs). The process of cDC migration to LNs is essential for the induction of immunogenic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> or tolerogenic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> T cell responses to peripheral antigens.</p><p id="Par5">The signals regulating cDC activation and migration have mostly been studied in inflammatory settings. Both can be induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), either by direct activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on cDCs or indirectly via cytokine production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, in addition to this proinflammatory induced migration, cDCs also continually migrate from peripheral tissues under homoeostatic steady-state conditions without overt stimulation. Accordingly, in steady-state, the afferent lymph<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and LNs contain a large population of MHCII<sup>hi</sup> migratory cDCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> while single-cell transcriptomic analyses indicate the presence of a small population of CCR7-expressing pre-migratory cDCs in various tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Homoeostatic cDC migration is thought to be especially important in the intestine, which is exposed to a plethora of foreign antigens derived from food, the microbiota and potential pathogens which requires a delicate balance of appropriate immunogenic or tolerogenic adaptive immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Several studies have characterised molecular mechanisms that impact the migration of cDCs or cDC subsets, including MyD88 signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, mechanical deformation of the nuclear membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> or the uptake of apoptotic material by cDC1s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, none of these pathways fully account for the continuous cDC efflux and turnover and the exact pathways controlling homeostatic cDC activation and migration have remained elusive. A major difficulty in the study of homeostatic cDC migration is that experimental observations reflect a dynamic system affected by several interconnected processes including tissue seeding, proliferation and cell death in addition to cDC migration.</p><p id="Par6">In this work, we utilise a suite of quantitative methods to assess cDC turnover kinetics and the associated changes in cDC phenotype and transcriptome in the small intestinal lamina propria (SI LP). We demonstrate that the SI LP cDC population is highly dynamic, with 14.4&#8211;22.3% of cDCs replaced by newly incoming precursors per day. This equates to a high rate of tissue egress and migration that results in the almost complete daily turnover of the migratory cDC population in the draining mesenteric lymph node (MLN). Moreover, our data show continuous changes in cDC transcriptome, phenotype and proliferative capacity over their life span in the SI LP. We therefore define these changes in terms of ongoing cDC development, followed by a transcriptional reprogramming upon homeostatic activation, shared by both major cDC subsets and conserved across tissues and species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Steady state cDC migration is accompanied by a transcriptional shift shared by cDC1 and cDC2</title><p id="Par7">To analyse the migration of intestinal cDCs, we made use of a CCR7-GFP knock-in reporter mouse model (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A, B</xref>). Analysis of CCR7<sup>gfp/+</sup> reporter mice revealed that pre-migratory CCR7-GFP<sup>+</sup> MHCII<sup>hi</sup> cells represented 1.5% &#177; 0.5 of the steady-state SI LP cDC population. Notably, in CCR7<sup>gfp/gfp</sup> mice, which lack the functional CCR7 receptor necessary for cDC migration, this CCR7-GFP<sup>+</sup> population accumulated to 11.5% &#177; 2.7 of the total SI LP cDC compartment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). To understand the molecular changes underlying the process of gut cDC development, maturation and ultimately CCR7-mediated migration, total CD45<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHCII<sup>+</sup> CD64<sup>&#8722;</sup> cDCs comprising both cDC1s (CD103<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>&#8722;</sup>) and cDC2s (CD103<sup>&#8722;</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> and CD103<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>) from the SI LP of CCR7<sup>gfp/+</sup> reporter mice were sorted and their transcriptome analysed by scRNAseq (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1C</xref>). The dimensionality reduction analysis identified 12 clusters that formed three main groups of cells corresponding to cDC1s, cDC2s and pre-migratory CCR7<sup>+</sup> cDCs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B&#8211;D</xref>).

The SI LP cDC1s and cDC2s showed similar levels of EdU incorporation, which was significantly higher compared to intestinal macrophages, the other major APC population in the gut (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Similar results were observed in a pulse-chase BrdU labelling experiment, with the proportion of BrdU-labelled cDCs decreasing by 5.26% every 24&#8201;h after BrdU administration (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). This rate of decrease, equating to a loss of 26.28% of cDCs per day, represents an estimate of the rate at which cDCs egress the intestinal tissue (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3A</xref>). Notably, in line with the transcriptomic data, the proportion of proliferating cells was significantly lower among MHCII<sup>hi</sup> CCR7<sup>+</sup> cDCs compared to the CCR7<sup>&#8722;</sup> compartment 24&#8201;h post BrdU administration, but continued to increase over the next 2&#8201;days, indicating that CCR7<sup>&#8722;</sup> cDCs continue to undergo homeostatic activation, upregulate CCR7 expression and enter the pre-migratory state (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Collectively, these data further suggest that initiation of cDC migration in the steady state inversely correlates with their proliferative capacity.</p><p id="Par12">However, in light of the high rates of EdU/BrdU incorporation of SI LP cDCs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C, D, E</xref>) it remained uncertain to what extent this reflected genuine local proliferation as opposed to labelling of cDC precursors in blood and/or bone marrow prior to tissue entry, as suggested by the velocity analysis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). To assess the relative contribution of newly incoming and local cDCs to the overall observed proliferation rate, we utilised transgenic mice expressing the histone-fused form of the photoconvertible Dendra2 protein in leucocytes (Vav-H2B-Dendra2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Following laparotomy, photoconversion of defined segments of the SI was performed by exposure to violet light, altering the emission wavelength of all Dendra-2 expressing cells from green to red. EdU was administered i.p. directly after surgery to label proliferating cells. This system allowed for precise quantification of the relative proportion of EdU<sup>+</sup> cDCs present in the gut at the time of photoconversion (Dred positive) and newly incoming cDCs (Dred negative) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">Somewhat surprisingly, proportions of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells among newly incoming (Dred<sup>&#8722;</sup>) cDCs were significantly lower than that of (Dred<sup>+</sup>) cDCs already present in the tissues at the time point of photoconversion (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). This was true for both cDC1s and cDC2s which showed comparable proliferation rates (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). In line with these observations, immunohistochemistry of SI LP showed that, although some were solitary, the majority (77%) of cDC1s were in proximity (&lt;40&#8201;&#181;m distance) to another cDC1, forming clusters of up to 10 cells in size, consistent with a high degree of local proliferation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2H-J</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, 73.5% of cDC1s in clusters consisting of at least five cells were positive for the proliferation marker Ki67, compared to only 47.6% of cDC1s present in small clusters (1&#8211;2 cells) (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3B</xref>). Unfortunately, we were not able to verify these observations for cDC2s due to technical limitations of their unequivocal identification by immunohistochemistry.</p><p id="Par14">Collectively, our data unambiguously show that cDCs undergo local proliferation in the SI LP. Moreover, our results demonstrate that cDC proliferation is not confined to incoming precursors or earliest developmental stages, but is in fact increased upon tissue entry, likely in response to local environmental cues. In contrast, the analysis of macrophage populations showed the opposite pattern, as expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, with the majority of EdU incorporation attributable to the newly incoming Dred<sup>&#8722;</sup> macrophage precursors and only minimal detection of EdU label among resident Dred<sup>+</sup> macrophages (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">Interestingly, the EdU incorporation data indicate that, contrary to the initial developmental trajectory analysis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>), cycling cDCs observed in cluster 2 and 7 do not necessarily represent cDC progenitors or immature cDCs at the earliest stage of the cDC life cycle, but may appear as a distinct cluster merely as a consequence of the discrete transcriptional state associated with proliferation. To more precisely assess how proliferation rates change as cDCs mature in the tissue, we sought a surrogate marker that would allow us to subdivide the CCR7<sup>&#8722;</sup> population to reflect ongoing differentiation. The expression of surface MHCII had previously been suggested to correlate with cDC maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Indeed, newly incoming Dred<sup>&#8722;</sup> cDCs showed lower surface MHCII expression compared to Dred<sup>+</sup> cDCs already present in the tissue (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2K</xref>). Furthermore, cDC1s and cDC2s showed increased expression of MHCII transcripts along the suggested differentiation trajectories of CCR7<sup>&#8722;</sup> cDCs (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Therefore, we divided the CCR7<sup>&#8722;</sup> SI LP cDC population into four equal bins (each accounting for ~25% of the total) according to their surface MHCII expression in addition to the CCR7<sup>+</sup> cells, which showed the highest MHCII surface expression among cDCs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2L</xref>). Accordingly, we analysed the rates of EdU incorporation along these maturation bins 2&#8201;h (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2M</xref>) or 24&#8201;h (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3C</xref>) after EdU administration. In line with the data from the photoconversion experiments, the proportion of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells gradually increased with maturation and surface MHCII expression. However, the percentage of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells declined sharply in the pre-migratory MCHII<sup>hi</sup> CCR7<sup>+</sup> cDCs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2M</xref>). Crucially, this loss of proliferative capacity was independent of CCR7 signalling, as a similar pattern of EdU incorporation was observed in the SI LP cDCs of CCR7<sup>gfp/gfp</sup> mice which lack CCR7 expression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2N</xref>). While we cannot map the maturation bins 1&#8211;4 precisely to the transcriptome-defined clusters of SI LP cDCs, these data collectively indicate that maturation of cDCs in the tissue is accompanied by an increase in proliferation, while cell cycle inhibition occurs as part of the transcriptional shift to CCR7<sup>+</sup> migratory cDCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>cDC maturation is accompanied by progressive transcriptional and phenotypic changes preceding homeostatic activation</title><p id="Par16">The gradual change in proliferative capacity of SI LP cDCs suggests that the life cycle of cDCs in tissues reflects ongoing alterations in their biology and functionality, shared between the two major cDC subsets.

While cDC migration can be induced by inflammatory stimuli, cDCs also migrate under homeostatic conditions and are thought to be essential in the induction of peripheral tolerance to harmless antigens, particularly in the intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, despite its importance, the exact kinetics and molecular changes leading up to cDC migration are not well understood. In this study, we used a variety of approaches to quantitatively define the kinetics of intestinal cDC turnover in vivo and, in parallel, address the molecular changes that occur at various stages of cDC life cycle - from tissue entry and differentiation to the initiation of the CCR7<sup>+</sup> pre-migratory phenotype and tissue egress. Our data show that the life cycle of gut cDCs is highly dynamic, characterised by progressive changes in transcriptome, surface protein expression and tissue-induced increase in proliferation rates. These progressive changes culminate in homeostatic activation of intestinal cDCs, accompanied by profound transcriptional reformatting and cell cycle inhibition preceding the egress from intestinal tissue and migration to the draining MLN.</p><p id="Par30">In their pre-migratory state, both subsets of cDCs undergo similar reprogramming&#8212;upregulating CCR7 and genes associated with motility, cytoskeletal rearrangement and a general shift in cDC functional specialisation away from a sentinel role in the tissues to antigen presentation in the draining LN, a characteristic transcriptional profile also observed in human intestinal CCR7<sup>+</sup> cDCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Collectively, this transcriptional signature of intestinal pre-migratory cDCs is shared across multiple peripheral tissues including liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and even found in other migrating APC populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. While this signature has also been observed in a population of tumour-associated cells termed mregDCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> it is likely that these simply reflect an activated state, rather than a distinct subset identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, these transcriptional changes likely represent the fundamental features associated with homeostatic activation of cDCs/APCs conserved in various tissues and across species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">However, while the transition to the CCR7<sup>+</sup> pre-migratory state showed a common gene expression signature, cDC1s and cDC2s retained differences in transcriptional reprogramming, reflecting their functional specialisation. Pre-migratory cDC1s showed a notable upregulation of Integrin beta-8, which cleaves pro-TGF&#946; into its active form, and ALDH, the enzymes regulating production of retinoic acid, consistent with the reported role of this subset in the induction of tolerogenic T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Notably, cDC1s also upregulated <italic toggle="yes">Il12b</italic>, in accordance with the higher potential of cDC1s for IL-12 production and induction of Th1 or CTL responses in the gut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

Moreover, prior studies had suggested that signals regulating homeostatic migration of cDC1 and cDC2 may differ. For instance, homeostatic activation of cDC1s but not cDC2s can be induced by LXR-mediated signalling following apoptotic material uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of S1P receptors can hinder cDC migration, possibly through the downregulation of surface CCR7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Our experiments revealed a differential requirement for S1PR signalling in steady-state migration of cDC2s but not cDC1s. These data suggest the molecular pathways utilised for tissue egress differ between cDC subsets which may reflect the different localisation or developmental requirements of SI LP cDC subsets. Notably, CD103<sup>+</sup> cDC2s have been reported to establish intimate contact with epithelial cells during their development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, which might necessitate the usage of additional chemotactic receptors compared to cDC1s residing in the LP.</p><p id="Par32">In addition to the major transcriptional shift associated with homeostatic activation and migration, our data reveal progressive changes in cDC phenotype in tissues. While traditionally maturation refers to the transition from the sentinel and antigen-acquisition state to an antigen-presentation state, we suggest that the term could be expanded to include the progressive changes in the phenotype, transcriptome and proliferative capacity of tissue cDCs, prior to CCR7 upregulation and migration. Indeed, the previously proposed term homeostatic activation may be more appropriate for the sudden shift in functionality associated with CCR7 upregulation and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. While it has been assumed that the majority of cDC proliferation in tissue is due to newly incoming precursors and the earliest stages of cDC differentiation, our data clearly indicate that cDCs proliferate throughout their maturation in the intestinal tissue, consistent with previously characterised clonal cDC clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Furthermore, cDC proliferation capacity increased after tissue entry and throughout their maturation and was only lost immediately prior to tissue egress. This suggests that local microenvironmental factors in the SI LP, such as Flt3L or CSF2, may control cDC development in peripheral tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">In contrast, homeostatic activation of cDCs is accompanied by a loss of proliferative capacity as evidenced by low levels of EdU incorporation. Interestingly, despite the high rate of turnover and migration, the degree of EdU incorporation of CCR7<sup>+</sup> cDCs did not equilibrate with the bulk cDC population even 24&#8201;h post EdU administration. This suggests that among the bulk MHCII<sup>hi</sup> CCR7<sup>&#8722;</sup> cDC population, the cDCs least likely to proliferate (and incorporate EdU) are most likely to upregulate CCR7 and subsequently leave. However, whether cDC proliferation and migration are regulated by same stimuli still remains to be determined.</p><p id="Par34">The molecular mechanisms controlling steady-state cDC migration are one of the great open questions in cDC biology. It has long been known that cDC migration is induced by overt inflammatory stimuli such as TLR agonists or proinflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Subsequently, several signals driving cDC migration in the steady state were proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, disruption of any of these pathways does not fully recapitulate the phenotype of CCR7 deficiency and none of the proposed mechanisms is likely to be the sole determinant of the regular and continuous steady-state cDC migration. Notably, mathematical modelling based on our data suggests that homeostatic cDC turnover may be the result of two different modes of cDC migration. Some cDCs may undergo homeostatic activation and migrate in response to discrete signals, such as those suggested above. Alternatively, cDCs may have a set lifespan in the tissue and subsequently leave, which may be controlled by cumulative signals, e.g. gradual accumulation of phagocytic or efferocytic cargo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a recent report proposed that local availability of growth factors may be an important driver of homeostatic cDC maturation in LNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Indeed, depletion of local growth-factors may act as a self-regulating stress response driving peripheral cDC maturation while accounting for a low rate of proliferation we observed in pre-migratory tissue cDCs. However, the observed kinetics of cDC turnover and proliferation could not be fully explained by either model, while a mixed model encompassing both behaviours closely fit the observed data. It is therefore likely that cDCs do not uniformly follow a single mode of migration. Instead, while some tissue cDCs stay an average of 5.5&#8211;6&#8201;days, undergo local proliferation in the SI LP and migrate at the end of this period, others may be induced to migrate earlier, in response to localised activation signals.</p><p id="Par35">The loss of proliferative capacity in pre-migratory cDCs is paralleled by an upregulation of apoptosis- related transcripts. This is also evident in migrating cDCs in lymph and MLN which may account for the extremely fast turnover rates of the migratory cDC compartment in MLNs. Interestingly, CCR7 ligation induces anti-apoptotic signals in DCs, which suggests a mechanism by which cell death of peripheral tissue cDCs may be deferred in order to enhance antigen presentation in the inductive sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. However, it remains elusive whether the upregulation of apoptosis-related genes, may act as a driver of-, or occurs in response to-, homeostatic cDC activation.</p><p id="Par36">Our data provide quantitative information on the key aspect of the intestinal cDC life cycle (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). We estimate the rate of influx of new cDCs/cDC precursors into the SI LP to be 14.4&#8211;22.3% daily. In addition, the number of cDCs in the SI LP is maintained through local proliferation, which increases with cDC maturation. These are balanced by a daily rate of tissue egress which we here estimate to correspond to a minimum of 26.3% of the cDC population. Interestingly, this rate of intestinal cDC turnover is notably higher than previously reported in other tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The reasons for this are not clear but may be due to higher exposure to bacterial components and PAMPs in the intestine compared to other tissues. However, it should be noted that cDCs in the MLNs draining the large intestine showed similar kinetics to SI-draining MLNs, despite the higher bacterial load and we could detect no decrease in the proportion of CCR7<sup>+</sup> migrating cDCs in the SI LP or MLN of germ-free mice. Accordingly, previous studies found that the percentage of migratory cDCs in the MLN or intestinal lymph was not affected in germ-free hosts suggesting that exposure to microbial stimuli is not a critical step in the induction of homeostatic intestinal cDC migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Other possibilities include a general exposure to a high concentration of soluble and particulate antigens as well as antigen derived from apoptotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Alternatively, the high rate of SI LP cDC turnover may also be driven by the relatively limited space available, leading to rapid depletion of local resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and a higher degree of mechanical stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> which both may increase the rate of homeostatic activation.</p><p id="Par37">The extremely fast kinetics of SI LP cDC turnover necessitate immense investment of resources and highlight the importance of continued tissue screening and ongoing antigen presentation. These findings also have important practical implications, as the high cDC turnover may make it difficult to manipulate cDC populations in vivo using inducible Cre systems, transfection, cell transfer and others. On the other hand, the fast turnover of cDCs may make them more suitable for manipulation in a therapeutic setting for one-off or even repeated treatments. Their short lifespan could also reduce any potential long-lasting side effects, which may account for the excellent safety record of DC-based therapies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Mice</title><p id="Par38">Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6&#8201;J (CD45.2), Vav-H2B-Dendra2 (Dendra, backcrossed to C57BL/6&#8201;J background)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and CCR7<sup>gfp/gfp</sup> mice were maintained under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions at the animal facility of the Uniklinik RWTH Aachen.

The one-compartment ODE design implies that the probability to proliferate is the same for all cells, independent of the time they have resided in the SI.
