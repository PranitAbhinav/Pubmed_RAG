SGUS of the parotid glands (PG) and submandibular glands (SMG) was performed according to the OMERACT scoring system. The predictive value of SGUS for diagnostic outcomes and labial salivary gland biopsy (LSGB) results was analyzed. The correlation between SGUS grading and unstimulated salivary flow rates (USFR) was also assessed using statistical tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Of the 171 participants, 130 were diagnosed with SjD. The OMERACT total score demonstrated moderate efficacy in diagnosing SjD, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78, a sensitivity of 0.52, and a specificity of 0.93. In comparison, LSGB showed the highest diagnostic efficacy (AUC&#8201;=&#8201;0.90), followed by anti-Ro/SSA antibodies (AUC&#8201;=&#8201;0.79). Combining the OMERACT total score with either anti-SSA antibodies or LSGB significantly improved diagnostic performance, achieving a specificity of 1.00. The diagnostic accuracy of parotid gland (PG) and submandibular gland (SMG) ultrasound grading was comparable. However, SMG grading exhibited higher sensitivity but lower specificity than PG grading. Additionally, SGUS grade 3 strongly predicted positive biopsy results (AUC&#8201;=&#8201;0.77) and showed a significant correlation with USFR, with Spearman correlation coefficients of -0.45 for PG and -0.51 for SMG.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Although the discriminatory efficacy of SGUS in patients highly suspected of SjD is suboptimal, SGUS may offer significant benefits for a specific subgroup of these patients. Grade 3 ultrasound findings are strongly associated with positive biopsy results and USFR, indicating a potential role in diagnosis and disease evaluation. SGUS may be considered for inclusion in future SjD classification criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13075-025-03642-4.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s Disease</kwd><kwd>Salivary gland ultrasound</kwd><kwd>Unstimulated salivary flow rates</kwd><kwd>Labial salivary gland biopsy</kwd><kwd>Diagnosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. 82104719</award-id><award-id>No. 82374318</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Hou</surname><given-names>Jiaqi</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Luan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">The diagnosis of Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s Disease (SjD) poses significant challenges due to its complex and multifaceted pathogenesis and wide-ranging clinical manifestations. The 2002 American-European Consensus Group criteria and the 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) - European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria are currently the most widely adopted diagnostic standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These criteria mandate the presence of specific clinical symptoms (such as oral or ocular manifestations) supported by immunological evidence, typically confirmed via labial salivary gland biopsy (LSGB) or detection of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies. Although LSGB serves as a critical diagnostic tool, its invasive nature may result in adverse effects, including local pain, bleeding, nerve damage, permanent sensory loss, or infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], leading to reluctance among many patients in clinical settings. Furthermore, studies indicate that LSGB findings may lack consistency across repeated assessments, with approximately 50% of patients showing altered results upon secondary biopsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In contrast, salivary gland ultrasound (SGUS), a non-invasive, convenient, and repeatable diagnostic modality, has garnered increasing attention from clinicians and researchers for its ability to evaluate salivary gland structure and function. By identifying abnormal morphological features, SGUS can complement LSGB and potentially enhance diagnostic accuracy.</p><p id="Par6">Although several prior studies have demonstrated the high sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound in the diagnosis of SjD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the lack of a consistent definition for salivary gland abnormalities remains a significant challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. To address this issue, the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) working group developed a 4-grade semi-quantitative ultrasound scoring system aimed at enhancing both the accuracy and standardization of ultrasound assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Subsequent studies have validated the effectiveness of this scoring system in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Despite existing research, prospective studies in this field remain limited. Moreover, the diagnostic performance of tests can vary depending on the population in which they are applied. With the use of the OMERACT scoring system, the efficacy of SGUS in differentially diagnosing SjD has been further improved. However, part of its high efficacy may be attributed to previous studies that compared typical patients with a broad, less specific population. To address this gap, the present study focused on a cohort highly suspected of having SjD, evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of SGUS in this context and its predictive value for biopsy outcomes. These findings may enhance a more comprehensive understanding of the role of SGUS in the diagnosis and assessment of SjD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par8">This is a cross-sectional diagnostic trial based on a prospective cohort. All patients had not been diagnosed with SjD prior to inclusion. The study aimed to assess the diagnostic efficacy of parotid and submandibular gland ultrasound in a population with a high suspicion of SjD. The study has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) under the registration number ChiCTR2400088752. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par9">The patients were from outpatients and inpatients of Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Enrollment occurred between March 2023 and February 2024. Inclusion Criteria: Eligible patients must undergo a clinical evaluation prior to enrollment to confirm a high suspicion of SjD. Patients should meet at least one of the following criteria for inclusion: (1) The patient fulfilled two or more items from the 2016 classification criteria, but no evidence of specific antibodies or LSGB was obtained. (2) The patient fulfilled one item from the 2016 classification criteria, and had evidence of immunological abnormalities (e.g., ANA positive, abnormal immunoglobulin), but had not yet obtained evidence of specific antibodies and LSGB. After enrollment, eligible patients will undergo the following standardized diagnostic workflow: (1) SGUS Examination: ultrasound examination of the parotid and submandibular glands using the OMERACT scoring system to detect abnormal morphology early. (2) Anti-SSA Antibody Testing: To assess immunological status. (3) LSGB Recommendation: Recommendation for LSGB for diagnostic confirmation, performed only after all prior assessments are completed. All data, including clinical evaluations, SGUS results, antibody tests, and LSGB outcomes, are prospectively collected and recorded prior to final diagnosis, ensuring the study&#8217;s prospective design. In this study, a diagnosis of SjD was made if patients met the 2016 classification criteria. All medical records were thoroughly reviewed to ensure compliance with these diagnostic standards. The exclusion criteria included: (1) Age younger than 18 or older than 75. (2) Other rheumatic immune diseases. (3) Patients with active or recent episodes of acute sialadenitis (within the past 6 months), salivary gland tumors, and other salivary gland diseases that can cause abnormal changes in SGUS, were excluded to avoid the potential impact of acute inflammation on SGUS findings. (Patients with a remote history of sialadenitis were included if they had no current symptoms or signs of inflammation). (4) Patients met the exclusion criteria outlined in the 2016 ACR/EULAR classification criteria. (5) Serious pathological changes or disabilities of important organs caused by other reasons. (6) Diabetes and malignant tumor. (7) Treated with hormones and immunosuppressants in the past.

According to the results of previous meta-analysis, sensitivity was 0.71 and specificity was 0.78 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. With a statistical power of 0.99, an &#945; level of 0.025, and an estimated prevalence of 0.7, a total sample size of 170 participants was required, including a minimum of 119 patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Salivary gland ultrasound</title><p id="Par12">All ultrasound examinations were conducted by an expert sonographer with over 15 years of experience. The ultrasound equipment used was a LOGIC E20 (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with a probe frequency range of 8.0&#8211;13.0&#160;MHz. Ultrasound images were evaluated and scored independently by an ultrasound specialist and a rheumatologist according to the OMERACT grading criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Specific criteria are as follows: (1) Grade 0, normal parenchyma. (2) Grade 1, minimal change: mild inhomogeneity without anechoic/hypoechoic areas. (3) Grade 2, moderate change: moderate inhomogeneity with focal anechoic/hypoechoic areas. (4) Grade 3, severe change: diffuse inhomogeneity with anechoic/hypoechoic areas occupying the entire gland surface. Fatty echostructures were graded 1 (minimal change) and fibrous echostructures were graded 3 (severe change). The raters were blinded to clinical data and each other&#8217;s evaluations. In cases of discrepancy between the raters, the images were discussed, and a consensus was reached. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using Cohen&#8217;s Kappa test.</p><p id="Par13">The ultrasound evaluations of the patient&#8217;s parotid gland (PG) and submandibular gland (SMG) were conducted simultaneously. Both the PG and SMG were assessed based on their bilateral ultrasound findings. For each gland, the length and area of the largest anechoic region on both sides were measured and recorded separately. The larger data of both PG and SMG ultrasound were extracted to form a new dataset named MAX.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Labial salivary gland biopsy</title><p id="Par14">The decision of whether to take LSGB was based on patients, but patients without a LSGB were not included in the final analysis. The biopsy specimens were evaluated by pathologists, with the results interpreted according to the 2002 or 2016 classification criteria, which define a positive result as the presence of at least one focus containing 50 or more lymphocytes within a 4&#160;mm&#178; area of tissue. In addition to noting whether the biopsy result was positive, the focus score was also recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Unstimulated salivary flow rate</title><p id="Par15">The volume of unstimulated saliva secreted by patients over a specified period of time was measured. The test time is arranged at the same time, usually from 2 pm to 4 pm, and patients are required to fast for 1&#160;h before the test. Prior to the test, patients were instructed to remain seated and at rest for 10&#160;min. They then collected all saliva produced over a 15-minute period in a clean container, after which the total volume was measured. Standard definitions exist for salivary gland dysfunction: normal flow (&gt;&#8201;0.2 mL/min), salivary gland hypofunction (0.1&#8211;0.2 mL/min), and hyposalivation (&lt;&#8201;0.1 mL/min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par16">Sensitivity and specificity were the primary evaluation metrics in this study. Group differences in qualitative data were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Correlations were analyzed using the Spearman correlation test, as well as univariate and multivariate regression analyses. A logistic regression model was used, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the efficacy of items for diagnosing SjD, as demonstrated by the area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 26.0.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Patients&#8217; characteristics</title><p id="Par17">Based on the sample size calculation, a total of 171 patients were enrolled in this study.

Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> showed the typical ultrasound findings for each grade.

These results suggest that the total OMERACT score offers relatively high specificity in distinguishing SjD patients from non-SjD patients.

The results showed that when the total OMERACT score was combined with anti-SSA antibodies, diagnostic efficacy significantly improved, achieving a sensitivity of 0.49, a specificity of 1.00, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 1.00, a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.38, and an overall accuracy of 0.61. Similarly, when the total OMERACT score was combined with LSGB, the sensitivity was 0.49, specificity was 1.00, PPV was 1.00, NPV was 0.38, and overall accuracy was 0.61. These findings demonstrate that combining the total OMERACT score with either anti-SSA antibodies or LSGB markedly enhances specificity and positive predictive value, making it particularly suitable for clinical scenarios requiring high diagnostic specificity. This combined approach leverages the specificity strengths of the total OMERACT score, complementing the diagnostic capabilities of anti-SSA antibodies or LSGB.

While the incremental diagnostic benefit of SGUS may appear constrained in this preselected high-risk population, we contend that the findings carry substantial clinical significance for several key reasons.</p><p id="Par32">First, SGUS stands out as a non-invasive, convenient, and cost-effective diagnostic modality, offering practical utility for patients with a high suspicion of SjD but lacking a definitive diagnosis. Beyond facilitating confirmation of the condition, SGUS can, in certain instances, diminish the reliance on invasive procedures such as LSGB. This attribute is particularly valuable in resource-constrained clinical settings, where it also serves to mitigate patient discomfort associated with invasive interventions. Although LSGB remains a cornerstone of SjD diagnosis, its procedural complexity and challenges related to patient compliance underscore the appeal of SGUS as a complementary tool. Second, the prospective design of this study specifically targets patients with suspected but unconfirmed SjD, aligning closely with real-world scenarios where SGUS is most relevant. For example, our analysis revealed a strong correlation between grade 3 SGUS findings and positive LSGB results. This suggests that SGUS could function as an effective preliminary test, informing the need for subsequent invasive evaluations and thereby streamlining the diagnostic process. By addressing this specific clinical context, our study provides actionable insights for clinicians managing analogous patient groups.</p><p id="Par33">Our research is based on a semi-quantitative scoring system proposed by the OMERACT Salivary Gland Ultrasound Task Force in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The reliability of the OMERACT scoring system has been validated in several studies. In 2021, Stephanie Finzel et al. reported that the weighted &#954; for intrareader reliability ranged from 0.44 to 1 for grading in the PG and from 0.59 to 1 in the SMG. The interreader reliability &#954; was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.47&#8211;0.74) for PG and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.47&#8211;0.72) for SMG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In 2022, Rossana Izzetti et al. assessed the reliability of the OMERACT scoring system in minor salivary gland ultra-high frequency ultrasonography using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICC values for grades 0 and 1 exceeded 0.9, while the values for grades 2 and 3 were 0.873 and 0.785, respectively, demonstrating strong inter-observer consistency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In 2023, Nanna S. Schmidt et al. confirmed the reliability of the OMERACT scoring system and suggested that the use of an atlas could further enhance both inter-reader and intra-reader reliability. With the atlas, inter-reader reliability improved to a moderate level (mean &#954;&#8201;=&#8201;0.52; range 0.31&#8211;0.77), while intra-reader reliability reached a good level (mean &#954;&#8201;=&#8201;0.69; range 0.46&#8211;0.86) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">The applicability of the OMERACT scoring system has been evaluated in several studies. In 2021, Xia Zhang et al. conducted a multicenter study involving 246 patients with SjD, 140 control subjects with non-SjD conditions, and 27 healthy controls. The study determined that the optimal cut-off value for the left (right) PG and the left (right) SMG was 4, achieving maximal sensitivity (75.6% and 77.2%, respectively) and specificity (91.6% and 92.2%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A more recent study investigating OMERACT scores for PG and SMG ultrasound in 242 patients reported a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 90%, with an AUC of 0.83 at a threshold score of 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Comparing our study with previous studies, an undeniable fact is that the diagnostic performance of SGUS may vary across different application scenarios. Variations in patient selection can significantly affect the diagnostic accuracy of a test. Unlike previous studies, which often included broader populations, this study focused on patients highly suspected of having SjD&#8212;a group that more closely reflects the clinical scenarios where SGUS is applied for differential diagnosis. These patients had typically remained under suspicion of SjD despite initial evaluations at secondary hospitals or community health centers and were predominantly referred to the rheumatology department of a tertiary care hospital. Of the 171 individuals enrolled, only 41 were ultimately not diagnosed with SjD, and 50 had negative LSGB results. The prevalence of SjD in this cohort was considerably higher than in earlier studies, leading to the underrepresentation of typical normal cases, which may have contributed to the reduced specificity observed for grade 2 ultrasound findings.</p><p id="Par36">Another potential factor is the significant discrepancy between the two levels in the OMERACT semi-quantitative scoring system. In this study, when grade 2 was used as the diagnostic threshold, the sensitivity was 0.85 for the PG and 0.95 for the SMG, while the specificity was only 0.46 for PG and 0.24 for SMG. However, when grade 3 was selected as the threshold, specificity markedly increased to 1.00 in PG and 0.90 in SMG, but sensitivity dropped sharply to 0.27 in PG and 0.52 in SMG. This suggested that a midpoint between grade 2 and grade 3 may yield a more optimal diagnostic performance. Currently, grade 2 is defined as moderate inhomogeneity with focal anechoic/hypoechoic areas, while grade 3 is characterized by diffuse inhomogeneity with anechoic/hypoechoic areas occupying the entire gland surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Incorporating more specific features and refining the grading criteria could enhance the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound in complex cases.</p><p id="Par37">The application of ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of SjD merits careful consideration. Despite the strong correlation between SGUS and LSGB, the prevailing consensus is that SGUS cannot serve as a complete substitute for biopsy. This limitation stems from the fact that ultrasound does not yield immunological evidence, and the focus score derived from biopsy is critically associated with patient prognosis.</p><p id="Par38">Nevertheless, the inclusion of ultrasound as an optional criterion in the classification of SjD may hold critical value. Several studies have explored this possibility with encouraging results. For example, a prospective cohort study by Esther Mossel et al. demonstrated that a positive salivary gland ultrasound, in conjunction with anti-SSA/Ro antibodies, was a strong predictor for SjD classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In 2020, S. Jousse-Joulin et al. found that incorporating a salivary gland ultrasound score (non-OMERACT) of &#8805;&#8201;2 increased sensitivity from 90.2 to 95.6%, with only a slight decrease in specificity (84.1% versus 82.6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. More recently, in 2022, Fran&#231;ois Robin et al. reported that adding the OMERACT ultrasound score to the 2016 ACR/EULAR classification criteria enhanced sensitivity (91.5% vs. 89.4%) while minimally reducing specificity (96.0% vs. 100%), with an AUC of 0.975 (95% CI: 0.945&#8211;1.00) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Importantly, the study by Esther Mossel et al. underscored that gland biopsy, salivary flow rate, and ultrasonography are complementary diagnostic tools and should not be considered interchangeable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Research has established a significant correlation between various SGUS scores and salivary flow rates. Yasemin Yalcinkaya et al. reported that elevated Milic and Hocevar ultrasound scores were associated with decreased salivary flow rate, while the homogeneity score correlated with low USFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. S. Garcia-Cirera et al. further demonstrated that both USFR and stimulated salivary flow rates were significantly correlated with ultrasound scores from the De Vita (0&#8211;3), Salaffi (0&#8211;4), and OMERACT (0&#8211;3) scoring systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Our findings corroborated that ultrasound grading is closely associated with USFR, suggesting that abnormalities identified through ultrasound reflect compromised salivary gland function. This supports the integration of ultrasound grade into the classification criteria for Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s Disease.</p><p id="Par41">In addition to being a possible item in the classification criteria, ultrasound grade can also provide some predictors for LSGB in clinical practice. Omar Al Tabaa et al. proposed that negative anti-SSA antibodies together with SGUS score&#8201;&lt;&#8201;2 could avoid LSGB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Our findings indicated that a grade 3 for either the PG or SMG is a strong predictor of a positive biopsy result. This evidence suggests that ultrasound, as a non-invasive and convenient diagnostic modality, is suitable as a pretest for LSGB.</p><p id="Par42">It must be acknowledged that the diagnosis of SjD is a multidimensional process. While this study primarily investigates the application of SGUS in diagnosing SjD, the critical role of ophthalmological involvement in disease assessment cannot be overlooked. SjD is characterized not only by xerostomia but also by keratoconjunctivitis sicca, with the latter serving as a pivotal diagnostic feature. Routine ophthalmological evaluations, including the Schirmer&#8217;s test, tear breakup time, and ocular surface staining, are widely employed to identify tear deficiency and ocular surface damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These assessments have been formally recognized and integrated into existing classification criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. By combining ophthalmological evaluations with serological markers and salivary gland assessments such as SGUS, a comprehensive diagnostic framework can be established, offering a more complete representation of the clinical characteristics of SjD.</p><p id="Par43">A notable limitation of this study is its design as a single-center investigation, which may have resulted in a regionally biased sample. Additionally, patients often had previously undergone evaluations at secondary or community healthcare facilities but continued to be suspected of SjD. This scenario contributed to an unusually high prevalence of SjD among the study participants, potentially explaining the discrepancies between our findings and those reported in prior studies. Nevertheless, this emphasizes the significance of our research, as the characteristics of the population on which the diagnostic test is applied are paramount. This study is prospective and closely mirrors real-world applications of ultrasound, thereby minimizing the selection bias associated with specialized populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par44">This study provides a novel reference for the application of parotid gland and submandibular gland ultrasonography in patients with a high suspicion of Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s Disease. Although the discriminatory efficacy of salivary gland ultrasound in patients highly suspected of primary SjD remains less than ideal, SGUS may offer significant benefits for a specific subgroup of these patients. Notably, individuals with ultrasound findings classified as grade 3 exhibit a strong correlation between SGUS results, positive biopsy outcomes, and unstimulated salivary flow rate. This suggests that SGUS holds potential value in both diagnostic evaluation and disease monitoring for certain patients. However, due to its limited diagnostic performance in high-risk populations, SGUS should be considered a supplementary diagnostic tool rather than a complete substitute for biopsy. Looking forward, SGUS could serve as an additional diagnostic approach within future SjD classification criteria, particularly when combined with serological testing, or as a preliminary assessment prior to labial salivary gland biopsy to enhance the overall diagnostic strategy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
