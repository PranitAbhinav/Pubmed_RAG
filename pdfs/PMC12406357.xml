This study aimed to investigate the effect of drought stress on the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of caffeic acid, photosynthetic mechanisms, and antioxidant enzyme activity in three cultivars of beans. The experiment was conducted in a split-plot design within a randomized complete block design, with three irrigation levels (50, 75, and 100% of water requirement) as the main factor and three bean cultivars (red, white, and pinto) as the sub-factor, with three replications.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">The results showed that drought stress increased the expression of caffeic acid biosynthesis genes and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (CAT, SOD, POD) in all bean cultivars. These responses were particularly stronger in pinto and red beans. For instance, caffeic acid content increased by more than 60% under severe drought in pinto bean tissues, contributing to improved antioxidant capacity. While drought stress reduced seed yield in all cultivars, the decline was less pronounced in pinto bean (about 14%), indicating its higher drought tolerance compared to the white bean, which showed a larger yield reduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">These results suggest that the increased expression of genes involved in caffeic acid biosynthesis and the enhancement of antioxidant activity are key mechanisms in plant adaptation to drought. Identifying and utilizing these mechanisms can provide effective strategies for genetic improvement and the production of drought-resistant cultivars. Moreover, the findings can contribute to optimizing irrigation management and improving production sustainability in arid and semi-arid regions.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>DPPH</kwd><kwd>Drought tolerance</kwd><kwd>Legumes</kwd><kwd>Photosynthetic mechanisms</kwd><kwd>Seed yield</kwd><kwd>PAL</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par14">Caffeic acid, a major phenolic compound recognized for its strong antioxidant properties, plays a vital role in various physiological processes in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It acts as a natural protector under abiotic stress conditions such as drought, salinity, and pollution by mitigating oxidative damage through reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Under drought stress, the production of ROS such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals increases sharply, which can lead to lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and disruption of cellular functions. Caffeic acid contributes to reducing these effects by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD), thereby preventing damage to cell membranes and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Legumes, particularly common beans (<italic toggle="yes">Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> L.), are considered a vital food source in developing countries due to their high protein and micronutrient content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Besides their nutritional value, beans play a critical role in sustainable agriculture by fixing atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with <italic toggle="yes">Rhizobium</italic> bacteria, thereby improving soil fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the productivity of beans is significantly threatened by drought stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Due to their relatively shallow root systems and high-water demand during flowering and pod filling stages, beans are highly sensitive to water shortages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Drought stress limits water availability, alters photosynthetic performance, enhances oxidative stress, and ultimately reduces yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">In recent years, the role of secondary metabolites in stress resistance has gained considerable attention. Among these, caffeic acid has been reported to increase under stress conditions, contributing to enhanced antioxidant defense and cellular stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, caffeic acid is synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway, involving key enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), and p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase (C3H) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Studies in crops like rice and wheat have shown that upregulation of these genes under drought conditions leads to increased caffeic acid biosynthesis, which in turn improves plant resilience by preserving membrane integrity, reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and enhancing water retention capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Despite these findings, there remains a gap in knowledge regarding the regulation of caffeic acid biosynthesis and its link to drought tolerance in legumes, especially in beans. While research in model plants has provided insights into the protective functions of this compound, its specific role in different bean cultivars with varying drought sensitivity has not been fully elucidated.</p><p id="Par18">To address this, the current study investigates the expression of caffeic acid biosynthetic genes (PAL, C4H, and C3H) and their physiological implications in three bean cultivars (red, white, and pinto) under different irrigation regimes (100%, 75%, and 50% of water requirement). These cultivars were selected due to their contrasting responses to water stress. It is hypothesized that cultivars with higher expression of caffeic acid biosynthetic genes will show stronger antioxidant activity and improved physiological responses, resulting in greater drought tolerance.</p><p id="Par19">The specific objectives of this study were to: (1) quantify caffeic acid content and antioxidant enzyme activities in different bean cultivars under varying drought levels; (2) assess biochemical and physiological responses such as proline, MDA, SPAD, and photosynthetic traits; (3) analyze the expression of PAL, C4H, and C3H genes involved in the caffeic acid biosynthetic pathway; and (4) investigate the relationships between gene expression, antioxidant mechanisms, and drought tolerance in common beans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Gene expression</title><p id="Par20">Drought stress, bean types, and their interaction significantly affected the expression of the <italic toggle="yes">PAL</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">C4H</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">C3H</italic> genes.

In this study, the effects of drought stress on various physiological and biochemical traits were evaluated in three bean types (red, white, and pinto). The findings revealed that red and pinto beans exhibited greater drought tolerance compared to white beans, primarily due to the activation of complex defense mechanisms in these species. This section explores the different molecular and physiological mechanisms and their interconnections.</p><p id="Par34">Caffeic acid is one of the important secondary metabolites in plants, playing a critical role in resistance to environmental stresses such as drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The production of caffeic acid is primarily mediated through the phenolic biosynthesis pathway, which involves the activity of several key enzymes. Within this pathway, the genes <italic toggle="yes">PAL</italic> (Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase), <italic toggle="yes">C4H</italic> (Cinnamate-4-Hydroxylase), and <italic toggle="yes">C3H</italic> (Cinnamate-3-Hydroxylase) play essential roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our experimental results indicated that the expression levels of <italic toggle="yes">PAL</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">C4H</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">C3H</italic> increased in all three bean types under elevated drought stress conditions. <italic toggle="yes">PAL</italic> is the initial enzyme in the phenolic metabolite biosynthesis pathway, catalyzing the conversion of phenylalanine to cinnamic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. During drought stress, the expression of <italic toggle="yes">PAL</italic> is significantly elevated in many plants because phenolic acids, particularly caffeic acid, protect cells against oxidative stress induced by drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Increased production of caffeic acid in drought-stressed plants has been reported to mitigate damage caused by free radicals and improve drought tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For instance, Liang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] reported that drought-stressed rice plants exhibited elevated <italic toggle="yes">PAL</italic> expression, which enhanced phenolic acid production and subsequently improved drought resistance. <italic toggle="yes">C4H</italic> is another critical enzyme in the phenolic biosynthesis pathway, acting downstream of <italic toggle="yes">PAL</italic> and converting cinnamic acid into p-coumaric acid. Under environmental stresses, particularly drought, plants often selectively upregulate <italic toggle="yes">C4H</italic> expression to boost the production of phenolic compounds such as caffeic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the present study, the high expression of <italic toggle="yes">C4H</italic> in red and pinto beans led to increased production of caffeic acid, contributing to improved drought resistance in these species. Similarly, researchers have reported that in wheat plants subjected to drought, enhanced <italic toggle="yes">C4H</italic> expression increased the production of caffeic acid and other phenolic compounds, which alleviated drought-induced damage and enhanced drought resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Like <italic toggle="yes">PAL</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C4H</italic>, the expression of <italic toggle="yes">C3H</italic> also significantly increased in red, pinto, and white beans in response to drought stress, indicating the role of this gene in enhancing caffeic acid production and improving drought tolerance. <italic toggle="yes">C3H</italic> is the enzyme responsible for converting p-coumaric acid into caffeic acid in the subsequent steps of its biosynthetic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Khakdan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] reported increased <italic toggle="yes">C3H</italic> expression in drought-stressed basil plants, leading to enhanced caffeic acid production, consistent with the findings of this study.</p><p id="Par35">Caffeic acid, as one of the secondary metabolites in plants, is particularly produced in response to environmental stresses such as drought and salinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The results showed that red and pinto beans exhibited significantly higher production of caffeic acid compared to white beans. This increased production of caffeic acid may function as a defensive mechanism against oxidative stress induced by drought. Caffeic acid contributes to the preservation of cellular membrane integrity by mitigating free radical-induced damage and preventing lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, it can be inferred that in beans with higher caffeic acid production, such as red and pinto beans, the reduction in oxidative damage supports the maintenance of biological and photosynthetic processes. Ultimately, this leads to improved performance traits. It has been reported that increased caffeic acid production in potato under salinity stress significantly enhances plant resistance to environmental stresses and ultimately improves yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Caffeic acid, as a phenolic antioxidant compound, has a significant impact on the activity of antioxidant enzymes and plays a crucial role in mitigating oxidative stress caused by drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This compound enhances the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD), thereby reducing free radicals in plants. SOD, as the first line of defense against superoxide radicals (O&#8322;&#8315;), converts them into H&#8322;O&#8322; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Subsequently, CAT prevents the accumulation of these harmful radicals by breaking down H&#8322;O&#8322; into water and oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Additionally, POD plays a vital role in combating oxidative stress by reducing lipid peroxidation and protecting cellular membranes from damage caused by free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Caffeic acid, by boosting antioxidant enzyme activities, not only reduces malondialdehyde (MDA) levels a marker of lipid peroxidation damage but also maintains cellular membrane integrity and mitigates oxidative stress damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, caffeic acid enhances plant resistance to drought stress by improving the antioxidant system&#8217;s performance and minimizing free radical-induced damage, ultimately contributing to better plant performance under adverse environmental conditions. Moreover, the higher activity of these enzymes in red and pinto beans leads to lower MDA levels (indicating reduced oxidative damage) and improved relative water content (RWC). These mechanisms protect cellular structures and maintain photosynthetic function, which positively impacts plant yield. Several studies have reported that increased antioxidant enzyme activity in plants under drought stress improves drought resistance and enhances grain yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">MDA is produced as a byproduct of lipid peroxidation due to oxidative stress and serves as an indicator of cellular membrane damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In this study, it was observed that red and pinto beans had lower MDA levels compared to white beans, indirectly indicating a higher resistance of these species to oxidative stress and a reduction in drought-induced damage. This decrease in MDA levels in the resistant beans could be attributed to enhanced antioxidant production and repair mechanisms in these species. It has been reported that drought stress treatments led to an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content, a product of lipid peroxidation, in the roots and shoots of canola cultivars, which was negatively and significantly correlated with seed yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A study on the effects of different drought stress levels on two bean cultivars showed that lipid peroxidation increased with the severity of drought conditions in all genotypes, whereas the fresh weight of the aerial parts, plant height, leaf number and area, and relative water content (RWC) decreased under various drought stress levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. On the other hand, proline is recognized as an osmotic compound in plants that accumulates under stress conditions, including drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The increased proline levels in pinto and red beans reflect their higher capacity to maintain osmotic balance and reduce osmotic pressure caused by drought. Proline can help prevent cell dehydration, preserve enzymatic activities, and stabilize protein structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Additionally, proline acts as an antioxidant, protecting against oxidative damage. This mechanism, along with other features such as antioxidant enzyme activity and the production of caffeic acid, contributes to the greater drought resistance of red and pinto beans compared to white beans. It has been reported that increased proline accumulation in plants under drought stress enhances plant resilience and performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Drought resistance in plants is primarily achieved through physiological and biochemical adjustments that affect seed performance and biological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In this study, photosynthetic characteristics were significantly improved in red and pinto beans, which helped these species become more resistant to drought. The relationship between these traits and the plant&#8217;s defense mechanisms is intricately interconnected. Caffeic acid, by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, can reduce damage caused by free radicals and provide a better environment for photosynthetic activities. This compound influences the regulation of net photosynthesis and can increase photosynthetic efficiency in plants by reducing oxidative stress induced by drought. Net photosynthesis depends on the production of carbohydrates and energy in the plant, which is directly influenced by environmental factors, including soil moisture and light intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Caffeic acid, by reducing cellular membrane degradation and improving the antioxidant system&#8217;s performance, aids in maintaining cellular structures during the photosynthetic process, leading to increased efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Net photosynthesis, as the most important process for energy production in plants, is directly influenced by stomatal conductance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Under drought conditions, stomatal closure leads to a reduction in stomatal conductance, resulting in a decrease in net photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. While the reduction in photosynthesis due to stomatal closure is observed in most plants, red and pinto beans have managed to compensate for this decrease through various mechanisms. In these beans, which show higher intercellular CO&#8322; concentration under drought conditions, this trait indicates the plant&#8217;s greater ability to optimize the use of available CO&#8322; resources and reduce the damage caused by stomatal closure. In these plants, stomatal opening leads to an increase in intercellular CO&#8322; concentration, which continues photosynthetic activity in an optimal manner. These physiological mechanisms directly impact seed and biological performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A reduction in photosynthesis is typically associated with decreased seed and biological performance. However, in plants that have increased drought resistance through the enhanced production of antioxidant compounds such as caffeic acid and antioxidant enzymes like SOD, CAT, and POD, or by increasing proline production and reducing MDA, photosynthetic performance and, ultimately, seed performance are better maintained. Thus, red and pinto beans, by improving their physiological and biochemical performance, were able to reduce drought-induced damage and maintain or even enhance seed performance under water-limited conditions. Similar studies, such as those by Fang and Xiong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], have shown that plants capable of using physiological mechanisms like better stomatal control, CO&#8322; balance maintenance, and reduced evaporation under drought conditions can sustain better performance and higher drought resistance. These studies demonstrate that plants able to continue photosynthetic activities while maintaining stomatal function under water scarcity exhibit higher performance [40 and 41].</p><p id="Par40">Despite the superior physiological and biochemical responses observed in red and pinto beans under drought stress&#8212;including higher levels of caffeic acid, antioxidant enzyme activity, and photosynthetic efficiency&#8212;the highest yield was recorded in the white bean variety. This apparent discrepancy can be attributed to the intrinsic genetic yield potential of the varieties. Red and pinto beans activate stronger defense mechanisms under drought conditions, which primarily contribute to stress tolerance and survival (e.g., maintenance of membrane integrity and photosynthetic activity), rather than maximizing reproductive output. In contrast, the white bean, despite its lower stress tolerance indicators, seems to possess a higher genetic capacity for yield production, likely due to more efficient assimilate partitioning, a greater allocation of resources to reproductive organs, and a higher harvest index. Similar findings have been reported in other crops, where genotypes with greater physiological resilience under stress did not necessarily produce higher yields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. These observations suggest that yield performance under drought is not solely determined by stress tolerance traits but also by the genetic predisposition of each genotype for reproductive efficiency. Therefore, the observed yield differences reflect a complex interplay between stress mitigation capacity and inherent productivity potential.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par41">This study demonstrated that red and pinto beans exhibit greater drought resistance than white beans, primarily through enhanced antioxidant responses, increased caffeic acid and proline levels, and improved photosynthetic efficiency. Elevated expression of PAL, C4H, and C3H genes contributed to higher caffeic acid biosynthesis, supporting oxidative stress mitigation. These mechanisms helped preserve membrane integrity and physiological function under drought conditions. Despite these advantages, white beans showed higher yield potential, likely due to intrinsic genetic traits. Overall, selecting genotypes with both high stress tolerance and yield potential can support sustainable production in drought-prone environments, and these findings provide a basis for future breeding and genetic improvement programs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Time and location of the experiment</title><p id="Par42">To investigate the role of caffeic acid produced in different bean varieties (<italic toggle="yes">Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> L.) under drought stress conditions, a field experiment was conducted during the 2020&#8211;2021 growing season at the research farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.

To construct cDNA, 2&#160;&#181;g of RNA was transferred into a tube, and 1 &#181;L of Oligo DT (5 mM) and 2 &#181;L of dNTP (5 mM) were added. The volume of the mixture was adjusted to 13 &#181;L. The tubes were incubated at 65&#160;&#176;C for 5&#160;min, then placed on ice for 1&#160;min and centrifuged for 5&#160;s. Afterward, 4 &#181;L of FSB buffer, 1 &#181;L of each DTT (0.1 mM), RNase Out (1 mM), and SSIII (1 mM) were added. The tubes were incubated at 50&#160;&#176;C for 60&#160;min, followed by 15&#160;min at 70&#160;&#176;C. Subsequently, 0.5 &#181;L of RNaseH was added, and the tubes were incubated at 37&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;min. Finally, deionized MQ water was added to reach a final volume of 100 &#181;L, completing the cDNA synthesis.</p><p id="Par61">For qRT-PCR, the synthesized cDNA was diluted 1:10. Then, in each reaction, 10 &#181;L of Master Q-RT-PCR (Invitrogen), 10 &#181;L of diluted cDNA, and 1 &#181;L of primer were used. Primers were designed using Primer 3 and Oligo Analyzer software and are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen) was used to perform the qRT-PCR.</p><p id="Par62">The qRT-PCR steps included an initial 4-minute denaturation at 94&#160;&#176;C, followed by 50 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 10&#160;s at 95&#160;&#176;C, 15&#160;s at 60&#160;&#176;C, and 20&#160;s at 72&#160;&#176;C. After each cycle, a melting curve program (ranging from 72&#160;&#176;C to 95&#160;&#176;C with a 5-second pause at each temperature) was performed, with fluorescence being recorded at 72&#160;&#176;C. The gene expression levels were analyzed quantitatively using comparative analysis against the reference gene with Rotor-Gene Q Series software. Control samples using water instead of the RNA samples were used to ensure no primer dimers affected the results. Data were presented as the mean of four samples (four replicates), and differences were compared using standard error.</p><p id="Par63">
