It is converted in the body to 5-fluorouracil (5FU), which inhibits thymidylate synthase, a key enzyme involved in DNA synthesis. However, it shows high individual variability in its effectiveness and safety. This variability may be due to genetic variants in proteins involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. Currently, only four variants of the <italic toggle="yes">DPYD</italic> gene (c.1905+1G&gt;A, c.1679T&gt;G (p.I506S), c.2846A&gt;T (p.D949V), c.1236G&gt;A/HapB3DPYD) are clinically actionable in terms of the UK chemotherapy board recommendations for the prediction of severe toxicity, and there are no validated predictive biomarkers of capecitabine effectiveness.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> There is also a widening list of DPYD variants recommended for clinical pharmacogenomic genotyping.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>This case report aims to detail the clinical course of a patient receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer who had a very rare DPYD variant which has not been reported in a database of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPdb) and developed life-threatening complications related to capecitabine treatment.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Case presentation</title><p>The patient was in his early 70s, fit and well. His general practitioner requested a prostate-specific antigen) test, which was found to be raised. An adenocarcinoma of the prostate was diagnosed. During the work-up, he was also diagnosed with an adenocarcinoma of his ascending colon and underwent a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy on 25 August 2022.</p><p>Postoperative histology showed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with lymphovascular invasion. Seven nodes were removed, which were all clear of cancer. The final staging was a pT3N0 adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon. Mismatch repair protein expression (MMR) was proficient (pMMR) and microsatellite instability (MSI) status showed stable MSI. He was referred to medical oncology for consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy as this was classified as a high-risk stage II colon cancer due to the presence of lymphovascular invasion. During his consultation, the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy were discussed with the patient. It was explained that there was a very good chance of being cured from both his prostate and colon cancer. Given that he had a high-risk Stage II colon cancer, the potential benefit of chemotherapy is around 2&#8211;5%.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> As there is no proven benefit of the addition of oxaliplatin in high-risk stage II disease, he was offered single-agent capecitabine (14 days in a 21 day cycle) for 6 months.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>As part of the treatment plan, DPYD genotyping was requested on 20 September 2022 before starting adjuvant chemotherapy.

He was offered a standard dose of 1000mg/m<sup>2</sup>, which was equivalent to 2500&#8201;mg BD. He had no side effects for the first 10 days of chemotherapy. He reported several side effects with diarrhoea and rash on 28 October and has become gradually worse on 31 October (14th<sup>th</sup> day of chemotherapy). He visited the acute oncology service on 31 October. He had completed the 14 day administration phase of his first chemotherapy cycle and was in the scheduled 1&#8201;week rest period. He had three too four episodes of loose stools per day (non-bloody, non-mucoid, no documented features of dysentery-like symptoms), a spreading rash, dry skin and lower lip ulcers (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 1).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> He was reviewed, and as blood results were normal, he was allowed home on loperamide.

There was worsening diarrhoea 15 times per day, with episodes of bloody diarrhoea and dehydration (CTCAE grade 4). A Ryle tube was inserted and drained 750&#8201;mL initially.

Therefore, patients should be discussed regarding potential rare mutations, and more detailed tests are not a cost-efficient way of testing for DPYD deficiency. Moreover, it will be hard to know the actual effect of having a rare variant.</p><p>In this patient, the subsequently identified variant, DPYD c.2179+2T&gt;C, is classified as ultra-rare, having only been reported in three individuals in the gnomAD population database.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The prediction tool SpliceAI indicates a high probability that this variant affects splicing, suggesting it might impair DPYD enzyme function.

For example, a recent case report described a patient heterozygous for the common c.2846A&gt;T variant who developed life-threatening capecitabine toxicity; subsequent phenotyping and full DPYD sequencing revealed an additional rare in-trans variant, c.2872A&gt;G, which was considered likely to have contributed to complete DPD deficiency.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Similarly, a cohort study of 120 patients with grade 3&#8211;5 toxicity found that carriers of at least one rare DPYD variant had a markedly increased risk of early and severe adverse reactions compared with controls, suggesting&#8212;but not proving&#8212;a potential link between rare variants and toxicity.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> A systematic review in 2024 identified more than 40 rare or novel DPYD variants, many found in heterozygous form in patients with severe fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity, although functional data remain incomplete for several of these variants<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Taken together, these reports support the possibility that rare heterozygous DPYD variants may have contributed to the severe toxicity observed in this case, but a definitive causal relationship is yet to be established in the variant in this case report.</p><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Learning points</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>This case illustrates the critical importance of recognising and investigating new rare genetic mutations in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) gene, particularly in patients receiving fluoropyrimidine-based therapies such as capecitabine.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The findings highlight the need for enhanced clinical vigilance and monitoring for toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy, regardless of their initial genetic testing results.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Expanding genetic testing protocols to include rare DPYD mutations may improve the identification of patients at risk of severe adverse effects, ultimately guiding safer and more effective treatment strategies.
