Sleep facilitates memory consolidation required during preclinical years and nurtures empathy and clinical judgement developed throughout clerkship.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 2</sup></xref> Paradoxically, the rigorous pace of medical school, which makes sleep essential, may be associated with insufficient sleep, thus posing a risk to learners&#8217; performance and well-being.</p><p>Previous research has suggested that sleep disturbance is common in young adults and medical students are no exception. A recent international systematic review and meta-analysis highlighted that 50%&#8211;60% of medical students report poor sleep.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> They consistently report restricted sleep quantity with an average duration of merely 6.5&#8201;hours per night, and up to one-third of medical students report excessive daytime sleepiness. Students with lower sleep quality report poorer perception of their educational environment, have poorer academic performance<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and perform worse on high stakes clinical assessments such as Objective Structured Clinical Examinations.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>Many factors can contribute to poor sleep among young adults. In medical students, high academic workload, stress induced by fear of failing, on-call responsibilities, the development of harmful behaviours to deal with demanding schedules, and high levels of depression and burnout have been noted.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Decreased physical activity levels and increased anxiety have been reported elsewhere.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Increased total screen time is also associated with poor sleep in medical students, although electronic device usage before bed has received minimal attention in this demographic.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4 6</sup></xref></p><p>The repercussions of poor sleep extend beyond academic performance; poor sleep is associated with lower perception of quality of life among medical students.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Students who experience substantial daytime sleepiness are more likely to report symptoms of anxiety and depression and lower reported quality of life.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> As medical education increasingly emphasises the importance of resilience, addressing sleep quality and mitigating sleep loss emerge as crucial strategies in combating burnout in future physicians.</p><p>Poor sleep and fatigue pose tangible safety risks for medical trainees. Occupational hazards associated with inadequate sleep include elevated risk of needlestick injuries and increased motor vehicle accidents during the commute home.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> While these risks have been demonstrated among medical trainees, studies and potential interventions often focus on resident physicians. There is increased focus on fatigue risk management within residency programmes, with new curriculum standards mandated by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Understanding factors influencing sleep quality among medical students prior to residency can inform curriculum changes that may positively impact their medical school trajectory and future careers.</p><p>Despite these issues, there is a notable lack of data on the sleep quality of Canadian medical students,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> a gap that persists amid growing awareness of sleep&#8217;s importance for cognitive function and mental well-being. Existing studies focus on diverse international contexts, yet the unique academic, cultural and geographical factors including northern latitude and multiple time zones in Canada necessitate investigation.</p><p>Canada&#8217;s vast geography is unique, spanning six time zones and including northern regions with significant seasonal variation in daylight which can influence circadian rhythms in ways not captured in studies conducted elsewhere. <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>Differences in provincial healthcare systems, including clinical exposure, call schedules and resource availability,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> add further variability to the medical student experience. Moreover, students often travel for electives and clerkships that displace them between time zones over short periods of time.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p>Canada&#8217;s cultural diversity may also uniquely affect sleep. Medical students from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds may observe practices such as Ramadan,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15 16</sup></xref> the Sabbath<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> or culturally determined evening routines that shift typical sleep-wake cycles. These variations can intersect with demanding academic schedules, potentially compounding sleep disruption. This study addresses these gaps by focusing exclusively on Canadian medical students and examining how these geographical and other factors influence sleep quality. It also explores under-researched elements such as travelling electives, time zone shifts and presleep digital device use.</p><p>The proposed study will explore sleep quality among Canadian medical students and has the potential to make significant contributions to the field of medical education, student wellness and policymaking. By addressing the notable gap in current research on the sleep habits of this specific demographic within the Canadian context, our project will highlight the issue and begin to uncover protective factors and stressors. We aim to gain insight into how academic schedules, such as preclerkship and clerkship, impact students&#8217; sleep quality. We will also assess the impact of digital device usage before bedtime on sleep quality, an area that has been poorly studied in this demographic.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The pan-Canadian scope of the research may offer early insights into the relevance of geographical location, providing valuable context for future studies.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Research objective</title><p>This study aims to assess the sleep quality among Canadian medical students and identify contributing factors to poor sleep.

A survey provides the opportunity to seek data from students at multiple medical schools across Canada in a feasible manner. Construction of the draft survey (step 2) is informed by a comprehensive literature review, the clinical expertise of a coauthor (LC, a sleep neurologist) and the lived experience of a current medical student (ZT). For step 3, as a step to establishing validity evidence, the draft survey will be reviewed by the other collaborators, which include leaders in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education and another sleep physician (JYL). To safeguard anonymity, all survey responses will be deidentified, and participants will receive detailed instructions on informed consent through the survey platform. Clear information will outline data handling, storage and usage protocols.</p><p>To measure sleep quality, two scales will be used. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) are supported by literature and explore sleep from two aspects&#8212;sleep quality and daytime sleepiness (details below), with the latter having previous validity data in the medical student population.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> We aim to strengthen this foundation by examining their applicability within the Canadian student population. The survey will be translated to French by a professional translation service and will be piloted by 4 postgraduate year (PGY)&#8722;1 internal medicine residents in English (n=2) and French (n=2) ensuring linguistic accuracy and consistency. Step 4 (survey delivery) details have been provided under participants and recruitment. Step 5&#8212;data analysis is provided below. For step 6 the results of the survey will be reported as suggested in the reporting guidelines checklists.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Participants/recruitment</title><p>Participants will include first to final year medical students (preclinical and clerkship) across six medical schools in Canada. These schools were selected to cover several provinces (Ontario, Alberta and Quebec), different time zones, and 3- year (Calgary, McMaster) and 4-year programmes (Universities of Ottawa, Toronto, McGill, Alberta). Time zones will include Eastern Daylight Saving Time (DST) (Ontario and Quebec) and Mountain DST (Alberta). Student recruitment will be facilitated by the collaborators at each site, who will liaise with their respective undergraduate offices and follow local policies for surveying students. Data collection (ie, survey distribution) will take place between September and October 2024. All students who complete the survey fully (providing implied consent) within the specified period will be included in the study.</p><p>Students will be invited to participate via an electronic survey by emails sent out to all students&#8217; institutional emails at each participating school. In addition, students will be invited to participate through school-specific social media groups and pages to ensure broad accessibility and representativeness of diverse student demographics, including those with limited social media engagement. We will also provide an incentive in the form of a gift certificate raffle for participants (6&#215;US$50). This topic is salient to students, which may increase response rates.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20 21</sup></xref> Realistically, we will aim for a response rate of 20% or at least 50 participants from each school&#8212;we believe sufficient for generating meaningful descriptive insights.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Participation will be voluntary. The data collection timeline was chosen specifically to avoid the time change at the end of DST, given that this has been demonstrated to have substantial impacts on sleep quality<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> and will occur when students are actively engaged in their academic studies. The survey will be offered in French and English. In Quebec and Ottawa, many students would consider French as their first language.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>While patients and members of the public were not directly involved in the overall design, conduct or reporting of this study, efforts were made to involve representative stakeholders in refining the survey tool. Specifically, the survey will be translated into French by a professional translation service to ensure linguistic accessibility for Canada&#8217;s bilingual population. Additionally, the survey will be piloted with four PGY-1 internal medicine residents&#8212;two in English and two in French&#8212;to gather feedback on clarity and relevance. These residents&#8217; insights will guide revisions to the survey, helping to ensure that it is contextually appropriate and accessible for Canadian medical students.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Instruments</title><sec id="s2-5-1"><title>Sleep quality and somnolence:</title><p>Sleep quality is inherently challenging to measure and relies heavily on self-reported metrics using validated clinical scales.

Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables presented as means&#177;SD. Two backward multiple regressions will be conducted using the categorical variables as independent variables and scores on the sleep scales as dependent variables. This type of multiple regression is appropriate to use when an analysis is exploratory and will help identify which variable(s) are predictive of sleep quality. As part of these analyses, we will check for regression assumptions including homoscedasticity and multicollinearity and respond appropriately to correct any issues. Overall model fit will be assessed using an adjusted R-squared. P values and effect size measures will be reported for individual variables. If the number of participants allows, we will also split the data in half for each analysis and compare the resulting models. Doing this will help ensure results are generalisable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s2-6-1"><title>Ethical and safety considerations:</title><p>This study was granted ethical approval by the Research Ethics Board (REB) at each respective site, including the University of Ottawa (Office of Research Ethics and Integrity, ref H-05-24-10336), University of Toronto (Health Sciences REB, RIS 46850), University of Alberta (Alberta Research Information Services, Pro00143579), University of Calgary (Conjoint Health REB, REB24-1062), McGill University (Faculty of Medicine Institutional Review Board, eRAP 24-07-092 IRB A09-E70-24B) and McMaster University (via email confirmation by Dr Lewis from the Protocol Review Committee on 15 August 2024). The research involves a pan-Canadian, cross-sectional survey exploring sleep quality among medical students, using validated self-report instruments&#8212;the PSQI and the ESS. Given the nature of the questions, which include queries about daytime sleepiness, substance use (eg, stimulants, hypnotics), and the impact of academic and social stressors, it is acknowledged that some participants may experience minor psychological discomfort or reflect on behaviours that cause concern. However, participation is entirely voluntary, and students may discontinue the survey at any time without consequence. No names or identifying information will be collected in association with survey responses; any email addresses submitted for the optional raffle will be stored separately and not linked to survey data.</p><p>The survey will be designed by a team of experts in sleep medicine and medical education to ensure relevance and sensitivity. The survey will be piloted by postgraduate trainees in both English and French. To minimise coercion, participation occurs privately and asynchronously, and all communication emphasises that participation is optional and confidential. No physical, legal or significant psychological risks are anticipated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6-2"><title>Dissemination</title><p>Following completion of data analyses in 2025, findings from this study will be disseminated through multiple academic and public-facing channels. It is anticipated that at least one peer-reviewed Open Access publication will result from this research. The project will also be submitted for poster/oral presentation at relevant national and international conferences.</p><p>In addition to academic dissemination, we are committed to sharing findings with medical students, wellness leads and medical education policymakers across the participating institutions. Through these combined strategies, we aim to ensure the findings are accessible, relevant and actionable across diverse audiences, from learners to leadership.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of sleep quality among medical students by examining various influencing factors and outcomes. Prior research has highlighted the importance of sleep for cognitive function and mental health, yet studies were predominantly conducted in Asian and European international settings,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> which may not fully capture the unique challenges faced by North American Canadian students, such as the influence of northern latitudes and multiple time zones. The present study uses a cross-sectional design, enrolling participants from six medical schools across Canada, including those who may not have sought help for sleep-related issues. This broad recruitment strategy aims to ensure a more representative sample of the medical student population, capturing a wide range of experiences and sleep quality levels.</p><p>In addition to assessing sleep quality and daytime sleepiness using instruments with valid results such as the PSQI and ESS, this study will explore factors such as electronic device usage before bedtime, academic workload, variation in academic schedules, extracurriculars, exercise and stress levels. By identifying modifiable factors that contribute to poor sleep, the research has the potential to inform targeted interventions aimed at improving sleep hygiene and overall well-being among medical students. To translate findings into practical solutions, results will be shared with medical education stakeholders through presentations, publications and potential collaborations aimed at designing sleep interventions tailored for Canadian medical students.</p><p>Study limitations include its reliance on self-reported data which may be subject to recall bias. Additionally, the study does not include perspectives from faculty, administrators or healthcare providers, which could provide further context to the findings. The cross-sectional nature of the study also means that causality cannot be established. Future research should consider longitudinal designs to explore changes in sleep quality over time and the long-term effects of interventions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> Grant for this project awarded by The Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Prepublication history for this paper is available online.
