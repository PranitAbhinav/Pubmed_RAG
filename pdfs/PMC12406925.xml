Seafarers often spend extended periods at sea, living and working away from home for long stretches. Seafarers face demanding working conditions and hazardous environment, which can negatively impact their health.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Research indicates that the risk of ill health and premature death is significantly higher among seafarers compared with workers on land.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 3</sup></xref></p><p>Ill health among seafarers can severely impair their ability to perform essential duties, posing risks to both their own safety and that of their crew. Medical emergencies at sea can lead to operational disruptions and increased strain on fellow crew members. In severe cases, emergency evacuations may be required, often complicated by unpredictable weather conditions and remote maritime locations. The nature of ill health of seafarers has been sparsely researched. The few existing studies indicate that seafarers suffer from a wide range of health issues, including communicable diseases, injuries and the exacerbation of pre-existing medical conditions.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>In Norway, seafarers are required to hold a valid health certificate to work aboard ships.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Despite a limited evidence base, the medical selection of seafarers has long been used to identify individuals at elevated risk of health-related events, including those with conditions such as cardiovascular disease, epilepsy and mental health issues.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> This process aims to ensure that only those who are medically fit are cleared for work at sea. Health certificates are issued by recognised seafarer&#8217;s doctors and include full health certificates with a maximum validity period of 2 years, time-limited or restricted health certificates and declarations of unfitness. Seafarer&#8217;s doctors assess both pre-existing conditions and current health status to determine medical fitness, as these factors may contribute to acute medical incidents at sea.</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess whether the medical selection of seafarers could predict the risk of acute somatic hospital admissions during the 2-year period following the medical examination. Specifically, we investigated whether seafarers declared unfit for service at sea or issued a time-limited health certificate in Norway had a higher risk of acute somatic hospital admissions compared with those who received a full health certificate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Material and methods</title><p>This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology cohort reporting guidelines.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design and population</title><p>This registry-based study includes Norwegian seafarers who presented themselves to a seafarer&#8217;s doctor in Norway between 2018 and 2019, to acquire a health certificate.

Risk comparison estimates, expressed as HRs, were reported both with and without adjustment for potential confounders, including age at the time of declaration, gender, level of education (primary school or no registered education, upper secondary school and higher education) and centrality of residence. Centrality was based on index categories 1&#8211;6, with an additional category for individuals who were alive but lacked a registered residence in Norway as of the reference date (1 January 2021). Individuals who had died prior to this date were excluded from the adjusted analyses through listwise deletion, affecting a total of 97 individuals. To satisfy the proportional hazards assumption, Cox regression analyses were performed in two separate time periods: 0 to 3 months and 3 to 24 months following the medical examination. The 2-year cumulative incidence of acute somatic hospital admissions was calculated as one minus the Kaplan&#8211;Meier estimate (1&#8201;KM). P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p><p>The data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 29, developed by SPSS Inc. in Chicago, IL, USA, and STATA version 18.</p><p>This study has been approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics of Western Norway (REK no. 185080).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>No patients were involved.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 43&#8201;758 seafarers, including 5452 females (12.5%), participated in this study.

It ensures that individuals with pre-existing health conditions, which may worsen or pose a risk to others while at sea, are either restricted to duties that mitigate potential hazards or, in certain cases, excluded from seafaring. Our results align with previous research highlighting the importance of reliable medical evaluations in identifying individuals unsuitable for seafaring duties.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The physical well-being of seafarers is essential not only for their own health but also for the safety of the entire crew, as medical emergencies at sea can increase workload and jeopardise operational stability.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>In our study, seafarers who received time-limited health certificates, or a declaration of unfitness, were, on average, older and had lower educational levels than those who received full health certificates. Access to healthcare services was also considered, as studies indicate that distance and travel time can significantly affect healthcare utilisation. Additionally, both acute and chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes and heart disease, are more prevalent in rural and remote populations.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Socio-demographic factors may influence the risk of hospitalisation in several ways. Age is a well-established risk factor for increased disease burden.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Lower educational levels are associated with reduced engagement in preventive healthcare.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><p>The elevated risk of acute admissions was most pronounced within the first 3 months for seafarers declared to be unfit. This finding suggests that these individuals may have had pre-existing conditions that were first identified during their medical examination, leading to a prompt increase in hospital admissions. This pattern is consistent with findings from general medical practice, where medical screenings often lead to an increase in unplanned hospital admissions due to previously undetected or unmanaged conditions.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p>Seafarers who received time-limited health certificates exhibited long-term hospitalisation rates comparable to those declared unfit. This finding may be particularly relevant to seafarers&#8217; doctors when deciding whether to issue a time-limited certificate for a short duration or declare a seafarer unfit, especially in borderline cases.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the admission rates of seafarers in the 2-year period following a seafarer doctor&#8217;s assessment. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of a large population of seafarers and current medical selection practices within the maritime industry. Our findings highlight the critical role of seafarer doctors in identifying individuals at elevated risk for acute medical events and thereby help to prevent health-related emergencies that could endanger both individual well-being and operational safety at sea.</p><p>The use of Norwegian health registries provides comprehensive and reliable information on all hospital admissions across both public and private healthcare facilities, minimising the risk of information bias.</p><p>The ability to adjust for key potential confounders, such as age, gender, educational level and centrality of residence, strengthens the validity of the findings by accounting for risk factors associated with hospitalisation. Furthermore, following seafarers over a 2-year period after their medical assessment allows an evaluation of the predictive value of seafarer medical examinations in identifying individuals at risk of acute health events.</p><p>This study does not include data on hospital admissions occurring outside Norway, as the NPR only records hospitalisations within Norway. This limitation may have led to an underestimation of the overall hospitalisation rate, particularly for seafarers who spend extended periods working abroad. The main objectives of the NPR are to facilitate administration, management, financing and quality assurance of the specialist health services.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> The purpose of health registries may influence the quality of reporting.</p><p>The study includes a 2-year follow-up period, which limits the ability to assess long-term health outcomes in the seafarer population. Another limitation is the lack of data on the specific reasons for health certificate denial or the issuance of time-limited certificates. Additionally, the available data only distinguish between time-limited and non-time-limited certificates, without information on other potential restrictions, such as limitations on areas of operation.</p><p>While our findings primarily reflect the Norwegian maritime workforce, the medical selection processes for seafarers worldwide are governed by the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> resulting in the applicability of our findings to seafarers internationally. However, differences in healthcare infrastructure, access to medical services and the prevalence of specific health conditions across countries could potentially limit the generalisability of these findings. Future research incorporating international data on hospital admissions and healthcare access could further strengthen these findings and provide a more comprehensive perspective on the health outcomes of seafarers globally.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study finds that seafarers who receive a declaration of unfitness, as well as those who receive time-limited health certificates, face a significantly higher risk of acute hospital admissions compared with seafarers who receive full health certificates. Our findings highlight the importance of comprehensive and continuous health assessments for seafarers to prevent adverse health outcomes, particularly among vulnerable subgroups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2025-103837</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-9-s001.docx" id="d67e520" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Norwegian Maritime Authority, the Norwegian Directorate of Health, the Norwegian Patient Registry and Statistics Norway for providing access to registry data.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was financed by Helse Bergen HF.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Prepublication history and additional supplemental material for this paper are available online.
