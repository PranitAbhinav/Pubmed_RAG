Introduction</title><p>The term &#8220;oroantral fistula (OAF) or oroantral communication&#8221; refers to abnormal communication between the oral cavity and the maxillary sinus. This condition often arises when the soft and bony tissue at the extraction site of the posterior maxillary teeth fails to heal properly, leading to perforation of the maxillary sinus<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. This complication is particularly common following the extraction of the maxillary premolars and molars. In addition to tooth extractions, other causes include alveolar bone fractures during maxillary posterior tooth extraction, displacement or failure of implants placed in the maxillary posterior region, alveolar bone dehiscence following implant failure, lesions within the maxillary sinus, tumors within the sinus, and complications arising from dental surgeries, such as the removal of odontogenic tumors, cysts, or the Caldwell&#8211;Luc procedure<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.</p><p>Once a fistula develops, sinusitis, fistula epithelialization, osteomyelitis around the fistula, and periapical abscesses can impede natural healing. Foreign materials retained within the oral cavity can obstruct healing, leading to the formation of a chronic fistula. Patients with OAF often experience discomfort, including pain in the maxillary teeth, halitosis, nasal discharge, and decreased perception of smell and taste<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>Although the exact incidence of OAF after dental implant removal has not been established, several case reports and clinical reviews have described its occurrence as a notable complication, particularly in the maxillary posterior region<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The absence of the periodontal ligament (PDL) around the dental implant and its removal sites may induce delayed bone healing compared to natural tooth extraction sites because PDL-derived cells and rich vascularity are present in the tooth extraction socket, which would contribute to favorable gingival tissue and alveolar bone regeneration in the extraction bone defect<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Such a delayed bone-healing capacity may contribute to the persistence of OAF after dental implant removal in the maxillary posterior region.</p><p>Several surgical techniques have been reported for the treatment of OAFs resulting from implants. These techniques include local flap grafting, platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), dermal matrix, and buccal fat pad (BFP) techniques. Among these, the BFP technique is particularly advantageous because of its autograft nature, which minimizes donor site complications<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Numerous studies have highlighted the benefits of the BFP technique for OAF closure, emphasizing its effectiveness in promoting soft tissue healing and fistula closure, making it a suitable approach for OAF treatment<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p><p>Anatomically, the BFP consists of a central body with four extensions<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The central body is located above the anterior border of the masseter muscle near the parotid duct and extends into the posterior maxillary region and buccal vestibule. Among the four extensions, the buccal extension is the outermost, covering the posterior region of the mandibular retromolar pad and buccinator muscles. The pterygoid extension is located over the pterygoid plates and connects the BFP body to the pterygoid muscles. The temporal extension passes below the zygomatic arch and covers the zygomatic bone and arch. Finally, maxillary extension extends posteriorly from the BFP toward the maxillary sinus wall. These extensions play crucial roles in maintaining the anatomical structure and function of the oral, facial, and temporal regions<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>The BFP offers several advantages when used as a pedicle graft. It provides an excellent blood supply and contains growth factors contributing to tissue survival and healing. The surgical technique is relatively simple, allows easy access for the surgeon within the oral cavity, and offers the benefits of a short operation time and a minimally invasive approach, thus enhancing patient comfort. In addition, the BFP ensures superior sealing capability, effectively closing OAFs and other defect areas<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Lastly, the low incidence of complications, such as fat tissue necrosis or infection, further supports its use, as these risks, although present, are infrequent<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><p>In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of OAF closure using the BFP technique, specifically focusing on its application in cases of OAF resulting from implant removal. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of this technique as a viable alternative for the treatment and subsequent management of OAF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>II. Patients and Methods</title><sec><title>1. Study design and patient selection</title><p>This retrospective study included patients who underwent BFP graft closure for OAF that developed after dental implant removal between December 2020 and August 2024 at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Jeonbuk National University Dental Hospital. This study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Jeonbuk National University Hospital (IRB No. 2024-09-018), on September 30, 2024. The selected patients had a BFP graft on the OAF that occurred after dental implant removal due to failure of osseointegration after implant installation and peri-implantitis. No restrictions were placed on age, sex, smoking status, or medically compromised diseases, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, among the selected patients. Patients with OAF in the posterior maxilla due to osteomyelitis or medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw unrelated to dental implants were excluded. We enrolled only patients with OAF due to dental implant removal. In addition, patients with a history of radiation therapy in the head and neck region or chemotherapy related to cancer, and those receiving antiresorptive treatment for cancer and osteoporosis, were excluded.</p><p>All surgeries were performed by a single oral and maxillofacial surgeon (H.S.) at a single center under either general or local anesthesia. This study focused on nine patients who received treatment in which the BFP was harvested and grafted to facilitate OAF closure. Postoperative follow-up was conducted to determine successful closure of the OAFs. The success rate of BFP grafting was evaluated, and the postoperative progression was assessed. Furthermore, we investigated and reviewed the clinical data of patients under the relevant guidelines and regulations.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Surgical procedures</title><p>The surgical procedure was performed under general nasotracheal intubation or local anesthesia. After positioning the patient in the supine position, nasotracheal intubation was performed, and routine skin and intraoral preparations were performed before draping. Lidocaine (2%) containing 1:100,000 epinephrine was administered to the posterior maxillary area of the affected site. A horizontal incision was created around the posterior molar, near the margin of the maxillary sinus perforation site. Anteriorly, a vertical incision was made for release to the mesial area of the posterior molar, and the incision was performed toward the maxillary tuberosity and beyond to harvest the buccal fat tissue. Full-thickness mucoperiosteal elevation was performed to expose the alveolar bone of the molar tooth and maxilla toward the zygomatic processes of the maxilla and maxillary tuberosity. For the BFP graft, the dissection was performed toward the central body of the buccal fat on the anterior border of the masseter. The fat was carefully dissected and retracted once it reached the buccal fat. BFP was packed into the fistula to cover the lesion area.(<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) The buccal fat was held in place with 4-0 vicryl sutures, and the surrounding tissues were sutured using a vertical mattress and simple interrupted sutures. Maxillary sinusitis was present in certain patients, and collaborative surgery was performed by the Department of Otorhinolaryngology. After BFP grafting and fistula closure, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) was performed by a single otorhinolaryngologist. Copious saline irrigation was applied, followed by pressure taping. Patients who underwent surgery under general anesthesia during hospitalization were administered intravenous antibiotics and anti-inflammatory analgesics until discharge. Oral antibiotics and anti-inflammatory analgesics were prescribed for approximately 6 days to patients who underwent surgery under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis to manage the infection and pain symptoms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>III. Results</title><sec><title>1. Surgical results of the BFP</title><p>Nine patients (age range, 52-86 years; mean age, 70.67) were included.(<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) Four patients were male (44%) and five were female (56%). The patients had multiple systemic conditions and medical histories, including hypertension in five patients, diabetes mellitus in two patients, osteoporosis in one patient, hyperlipidemia in five patients, and knee arthritis in one patient. Two patients had no associated medical conditions or history. The majority of OAFs were located in the maxillary posterior region because of their proximity to the maxillary sinus, and four of the nine patients had OAF involving the second premolar area (56%). Lesion sizes varied between 5&#215;5 mm and 13&#215;13 mm, with an average dimension of 8.6 mm in width and 11.2 mm in length.(<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>)</p><p>We found two main causes of OAF. First, OAF occurred during implant installation, and implant osseointegration failed after implant insertion in five patients (55.56%).(<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2. A</xref>) Two of the five patients visited our department with a dental implant placed in the maxilla or maxillary sinus, and the other three patients visited with the opening state of the drilled site for implant insertion. Spontaneous healing of the opening fistula was expected; however, it did not heal and consequently formed a fistula that communicated with the oral cavity to the maxillary sinus. The second reason is dental implant removal due to peri-implantitis. Four patients (44.44%) visited our hospital with OAF where the dental implant had been placed.(<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2. B</xref>) The patient had been treated with a dental implant for several years; however, chronic inflammation occurred around the implant, which had to be removed. After the removal of the dental implant, an OAF was formed at the removal site, which led to communication through the maxillary sinus.</p><p>The OAF duration varied from 1 to 6 months in each patient. Most patients were able to determine the date of dental implant installation surgery and removal surgery, except for one patient. After removal of the dental implant, we waited for at least 1 month to encourage spontaneous healing and closure of the fistula. However, this did not occur and led to a permanent fistula; therefore, we decided to perform the BFP graft at least 1 month after dental implant removal.</p><p>Notably, in four patients (44.44%), maxillary sinusitis was accompanied by OAF on the ipsilateral side. Pus was discharged into the oral cavity via the OAF. Radiographic opacity, thick mucus, and fluid collection were observed in the ipsilateral maxillary sinus. The patient with maxillary sinusitis underwent collaborative surgery by an otorhinolaryngologist. The patient underwent FESS on the ipsilateral side after BFP grafting under general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Case presentations</title><p>In the nine patients, the total success rate of OAF closure using the graft was 100%. In seven patients (82%), the OAF was successful in just only during the first surgery. However, OAF closure was not achieved during the first surgery in two patients (Patient 1 and Patient 2); therefore, additional surgery was performed. While the procedure initially appeared successful in all cases, two patients (27%) exhibited incomplete closure of the OAF. Nonetheless, complete healing was ultimately achieved in both cases through the additional second surgery during follow-up.</p><p>Patient 1 was a 72-year-old female with no significant systemic disease or ongoing medications. She had undergone an implant placement procedure at a local dental clinic 3 months before her initial visit to our department, where a dental implant was placed in the left maxillary region. This dental implant was suspected to have failed to achieve osseointegration with the alveolar bone, was inserted inside the maxillary sinus, and developed sinusitis on its side.(<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3. A</xref>) The patient experienced nasal obstruction, purulent nasal discharge, and intraoral pus discharge. Consequently, surgical intervention was planned in collaboration with otolaryngology 4 months after the initial symptom onset to address the left maxillary sinusitis. The procedure involved BFP grafting to facilitate closure of the oral maxillary fistula, as well as removal of the embedded implant and FESS. Following the procedure under general anesthesia, the implant was successfully removed from the left maxillary sinus, resulting in improved sinusitis symptoms. However, during the 2-month follow-up, the OAF was not completely closed and remained in an open state. Additional BFP grafting surgery was performed under local anesthesia to facilitate OAF closure. OAF closure was confirmed during the 3-month follow-up after the second surgery.(<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3. B</xref>)</p><p>Patient 2 was an 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension for which he was currently medicated. He initially underwent dental implant placement in regions #25 and #27 at a local dental clinic 18 months before visiting our department. A third surgical attempt for implant installation in areas #25 and #27 with sinus augmentation was made in the local dental clinic. Dental implants #25 and #27 were placed in the alveolar bone with bone graft material, accompanied by sinusitis.(<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4. A</xref>) One month after the first visit to our department, we removed the dental implant, bone graft material from the maxillary sinus, and the BFP graft under local anesthesia. During follow-up, the OAF did not close, the pus was discharged via a pre-existing fistula, and the signs of maxillary sinusitis did not improve. The patient was subsequently referred to the otolaryngology department for further evaluation, and collaborative surgery (FESS and BFP graft) was performed under general anesthesia 3 months after the initial surgery. Three months after the second surgery, favorable soft tissue healing was observed, confirming successful closure of the OAF.(<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4. B</xref>)</p><p>Patient 8 involved a 76-year-old female with a history of knee arthritis and hyperlipidemia. Four years before her initial visit, she had undergone extraction of the left maxillary second premolar, followed by immediate implant placement at a local dental clinic. Subsequently, the patient reported no significant symptoms and functioned well with her dentition for approximately 4 years. However, 1 month before her visit, peri-implantitis developed around tooth #25 and necessitated implant removal. After extraction, the OAF developed. Although six attempts were made to suture the soft tissue of the left maxilla at the local dental clinic, these attempts were unsuccessful, resulting in persistent observation of OAF. On the day of her visit to us, under local anesthesia, we attempted to close the OAF using a BFP at the left maxillary molar region. Following 2 months of observation, satisfactory closure of the soft tissue was achieved.(<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>)</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>IV. Discussion</title><p>OAF is a serious complication of dental procedures, particularly after the extraction of the maxillary posterior teeth and dental implant failures<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The development of OAF is problematic because of the communication between the oral cavity and maxillary sinus, leading to the potential for chronic maxillary sinusitis and persistent infections<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Closing an OAF is crucial for preventing food and saliva from entering the maxillary sinus, which can cause maxillary sinusitis. Generally, defects smaller than 3 mm in diameter can heal spontaneously on their own, whereas defects exceeding 3 mm require surgical intervention. Several surgical methods, such as local flap and BFP graft, have been proposed for the treatment of OAF<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>The success of surgery is related to the method used, presence of concomitant maxillary sinusitis, and patient&#8217;s overall health. Surgical treatment of OAF can also be affected by the size of the fistula and duration of its occurrence. It is crucial to select an appropriate surgical method based on a proper diagnosis and the patient&#8217;s condition<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Collaborative surgery with otolaryngologists is required, depending on the accompanying maxillary sinusitis. Previously, surgical methods such as fistula excision followed by primary closure, palatal rotation flap, and buccal advancement flap have been used for OAF closure<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Pedicled BFP grafts have been successfully used to close large OAF. BFP has advantages over local flaps in that it is easy to harvest, reaches the blood supply, and is pliable and adaptable to intraoral defects<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The BFP graft can be effectively applied for the reliable coverage of several oral mucosal defects. It can be grafted onto cleft palate defects with palatoplasty and can contribute to the success of cleft palate repair<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. In addition, BFP is grafted to the buccal mucosal defect after squamous cell carcinoma excision and posterior mandible defects following sequestrectomy and bony reconstruction<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to verify the effectiveness of BFP grafts in OAF closure following dental implant removal. Repair of OAF due to dental implants is a challenging problem. Compared to the tooth extraction socket, the bony defect after dental implant removal lacks PDL cells, osteoprogenitor cells, and gingival fibroblasts that can heal spontaneously, promote gingival growth, and lead to fistula closure<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Bone regeneration after implant removal requires a long period for healing and bone formation. Because of this drawback of the limitation of the dental implant removal defect bone healing, the OAF due to the dental implant removal has more chances of leaving a persistent defect rather than a tooth extraction defect. A limited number of reports exist detailing effective treatment methods for OAFs that develop after dental implant removal. BFP grafting exhibited a perfect success rate for OAF closure, reinforcing its utility as a viable and effective treatment modality. However, two of the total nine patients required a second surgery due to residual maxillary sinusitis and failure of the first BFP graft. This was resolved by the collaborative surgery of FESS and a second BFP graft.</p><p>Regarding the primary causes of OAF occurrence, over half of the cases (55.56%) resulted from the failure of osseointegration during the initial implant installation. This highlights the importance of achieving primary implant stability and proper bone integration during the first implantation attempt to prevent the development of OAF. Bone condition and volume do not significantly impact the long-term failure rate of implants. However, low bone density can pose a considerable risk to implant outcomes, and implant location in the posterior jaw can contribute to dental implant failure. The risk of osseointegration failure increases in patients with low bone density, making it essential to evaluate bone quality before implant placement<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. The remaining 44.44% of cases were attributed to implant removal due to peri-implantitis over a long period, demonstrating that chronic inflammation and alveolar bone loss around dental implants significantly contribute to OAF formation.</p><p>The BFP graft successfully closed the OAF in the first surgery; however, the OAF did not recover in the first surgery in two patients (1 and 2), and an additional second surgery was required. Although the first BFP graft was performed with FESS in Patient 1, the fistula was not completely closed and remained open. Additional BFP grafting surgery was performed under local anesthesia to facilitate OAF closure. Three months after the second surgery, the OAF had completely closed. Patient 2 visited our department with a dental implant in the left maxillary sinus with bone graft material, accompanied by maxillary sinusitis. An OAF was observed on the left posterior maxilla, which is a dental implant, and purulent pus was discharged via the OAF. The dental implant and bone graft material were removed, and the BFP was grafted for closure of the OAF. The BFP graft was successfully used for OAF closure, and the OAF was not closed because maxillary sinusitis was not a failure of the BFP graft. The pus was discharged via a preexisting fistula, and additional treatment for maxillary sinusitis was required. Therefore, a second BFP graft surgery was performed with FESS under general anesthesia, and maxillary sinusitis and OAF were successfully resolved.</p><p>One notable finding of this study was that 44.44% of patients presented with maxillary sinusitis due to dental implant installation. This emphasizes the importance of a thorough maxillary sinus evaluation in patients with OAF. Iatrogenic OAF is the most common etiology of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. A multidisciplinary oral and nasal approach is recommended as the best option for treating patients with odontogenic sinusitis with OAF<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. In our patient, the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration with otorhinolaryngology specialists was evident, and collaborative surgery was performed using FESS and BFP grafts. Concurrent treatment of maxillary sinusitis significantly improved postoperative outcomes, ensuring that maxillary sinus health was restored while successfully closing the OAF.</p><p>Buccal fat-pad grafting has emerged as a highly effective option for OAF closure, particularly in cases of dental implant-related failure. The anatomical properties of the BFP allow for excellent vascularity, adaptability, and minimal donor-site morbidity, making it a superior alternative to other soft tissue flaps<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Previous studies have emphasized the success of BFP grafting in several maxillofacial applications, including OAF closure, cleft palate repair, and reconstructive surgeries<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. The findings of this study further corroborate these advantages, as evidenced by the successful closure of all OAFs included in the study.</p><p>Despite the overall success, two cases required secondary surgeries for complete OAF closure. The first case involved a dental implant displaced into the maxillary sinus, leading to maxillary sinusitis. The initial collaborative surgery of the BFP graft and FESS was insufficient due to ongoing inflammation, necessitating a second intervention; therefore, an additional BFP graft was performed after recovery from maxillary sinusitis. The second case involved a patient who underwent two implant placement attempts with sinus augmentation. Loss of the initial stability of the dental implant and failure of sinus augmentation are the primary causes of maxillary sinusitis. Before the evaluation and treatment of maxillary sinusitis, closure of the OAF with a BFP graft was performed, which led to the failure of the first surgery. The second patient demonstrated the importance of addressing the underlying sinus pathology before attempting definitive closure of the fistula.</p><p>Based on the finding that the average size of the OAFs in the nine patients included in this study was 8.6 mm in width and 11.2 mm in length, it is evident that OAFs in the maxillary posterior region require adequate closure encompassing both the lesion and the surrounding healthy soft tissue. In this context, compared with other commonly employed techniques for OAF closure&#8212;including local pedicled flap procedures, PRF, platelet-rich plasma, or collagen membranes&#8212;the anatomical proximity of the BFP to the defect site and the ease of harvesting sufficient tissue volume make it particularly advantageous<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Furthermore, as postoperative soft tissue healing is largely dependent on sufficient vascularity of the flap, the robust blood supply to the BFP suggests that it serves as a reliable and stable first-line treatment option for the closure of OAFs.</p><p>This study is subject to certain limitations, including a small sample size and the retrospective case series. So, the prospective studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to validate the findings of this study and to establish standardized protocols for the management of OAFs associated with dental implant failure. Although adequate closure of the OAF was achieved in all cases, most patients did not proceed with prosthetic rehabilitation. Notably, the lack of sufficient bone regeneration at the defect site frequently was resulted in inadequate support for implant placement. Consequently, dental implant was not feasible in the majority of cases, and only one patient was able to undergo prosthetic treatment using a removable partial denture.</p><p>Overall, this study highlights the clinical significance of BFP grafting in the management of OAFs following dental implant failure. The use of BFP is not only a reliable and minimally invasive technique but also provides long-term stability in OAF closure. In addition, this study emphasizes the necessity of primary implant stability, proper osseointegration, and careful surgical planning to prevent OAF formation. Furthermore, interdisciplinary collaboration with otorhinolaryngologists is crucial for optimizing treatment outcomes in cases complicated by maxillary sinusitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>V. Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study reinforces the efficacy of the BFP as a valuable tool for OAF closure of OAFs following implant removal. Given its high success rate, minimal complications, and ease of surgical technique, BFP grafting should be considered as a primary treatment option for patients presenting with OAFs. Future research with a larger patient cohort and long-term follow-ups will be beneficial to further validate these findings and refine the treatment protocols for OAF management.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Prof. Jong Seung Kim who participated in the surgical management of functional endoscopic sinus surgery for the maxillary sinusitis patients who were enrolled for our study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p>
