Although there have been great advances in genomics, the molecular mechanisms essential to HCC progression are not yet fully implicit, particularly at the single-cell stage. This research utilized single-cell RNA sequencing technology to evaluate transcriptional heterogeneity, immune cell infiltration, and potential therapeutic targets in HCC. A detailed bioinformatics pipeline used in the experiment included quality control, feature selection, dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), clustering, differential gene expression, pseudotime trajectory inference, and immune cell profiling with GSEA and survival analysis examining potential biomarkers of survival. Key findings include the identification of 1178 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with macrophage infiltration contributing to immune evasion. Notably, APOE and ALB are linked to a better prognosis, while XIST and FTL are associated with poor survival. The potential drug candidates include IGMESINE in the case of SERPINA1 and PKR-A/MITZ for APOA2 in the gene-drug interaction analysis. Graph Neural Network (GNN) is used to predict drug-gene interactions and rank potential therapeutic candidates. The model shows robust predictive performance (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>&#178;: 0.9867, MSE: 0.0581) and identifies important drug candidates, such as Gadobenate Dimeglumine and Fluvastatin, and describes repurposing opportunities in network analysis, enhancing computational drug discovery for novel treatments. This research sheds new light on HCC tumor evolution, immune suppression, and the potential drug target based on the viewpoint of the importance of single-cell approaches in liver cancer research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Computational biology and bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>Health care</kwd><kwd>Medical research</kwd><kwd>Oncology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Bozhou Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology</institution></funding-source><award-id>BZZD2024006</award-id><award-id>BZZD2024006</award-id><award-id>BZZD2024006</award-id><award-id>BZZD2024006</award-id><award-id>BZZD2024006</award-id><award-id>BZZD2024006</award-id><award-id>BZZD2024006</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Bozhou Municipal Health Commission Subjects</institution></funding-source><award-id>BZWJ2023A004</award-id><award-id>BZWJ2023A004</award-id><award-id>BZWJ2023A004</award-id><award-id>BZWJ2023A004</award-id><award-id>BZWJ2023A004</award-id><award-id>BZWJ2023A004</award-id><award-id>BZWJ2023A004</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Bengbu Medical University Research Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>2023BYZD202</award-id><award-id>2023BYZD202</award-id><award-id>2023BYZD202</award-id><award-id>2023BYZD202</award-id><award-id>2023BYZD202</award-id><award-id>2023BYZD202</award-id><award-id>2023BYZD202</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Anhui Medical University Doctoral Research Fund</institution></funding-source><award-id>BY2022015</award-id><award-id>BY2022015</award-id><award-id>BY2022015</award-id><award-id>BY2022015</award-id><award-id>BY2022015</award-id><award-id>BY2022015</award-id><award-id>BY2022015</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Key Projects of Anhui Provincial Department of Education</institution></funding-source><award-id>2023AH050658</award-id><award-id>2023AH050658</award-id><award-id>2023AH050658</award-id><award-id>2023AH050658</award-id><award-id>2023AH050658</award-id><award-id>2023AH050658</award-id><award-id>2023AH050658</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, is the most frequent cancer of the primary liver and represents one of the foremost causes of cancer-linked mortality in universal. About 75 to 85% of all liver cancers are hepatocellular in origin, as the incidence of this disease rises globally due to chronic liver illness, infections from hepatitis B and C viruses, alcoholism, and metabolic syndromes, such as NAFLD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The tumor develops initially asymptomatic and is therefore diagnosed at an advanced stage, hence giving very limited options for treatment and a poor prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The disease recurs at a high rate, and conventional therapies have been practically ineffective; this disease has shown rapid progression. New findings in genomics indicate that HCC is highly heterogeneous at molecular and cellular levels. This heterogeneity includes complex interactions with tumor cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells within the tumor microenvironment. The conventional methods of bulk RNA sequencing cannot capture this heterogeneity and simple average gene expression across a wide number of different cell populations.</p><p id="Par3">Single-cell RNA sequencing has been established to be a significant technology for dissecting cellular diversity and discovering tumor-specific molecular signatures, thus providing a more precise understanding of tumor evolution, mechanisms that lead to immune evasion, and mechanisms of drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Although earlier studies by scRNA-seq have indicated significant transcriptional differences between tumor and normal liver tissues, the need remains to map the microenvironment of HCC and discover novel therapeutic targets. Here, as highlighted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the scRNA dataset was used to examine the transcriptional landscape of HCC at the single-cell intensity. Research methods involved thorough preprocessing of data, feature selection, PCA for reducing dimensionality, and cell-type annotation by applying UMAP and t-SNE for clustering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Differential gene expression analysis was done to identify crucial molecular drivers in the sequence of HCC, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for dysregulated pathways. Pseudotime trajectory analysis was used to infer cellular differentiation states. Immune cell infiltration analysis suggested that TAMs are key regulators of the HCC microenvironment. Gene expression correlates with survival by doing the survival analysis, and drug sensitivity analysis was carried out to find potential therapeutic targets. PCR array screening revealed that immune-related genes are increased in HBV-infected HepG2.2.15 cells, with SERPINA1, FN1, and IL1R2 being particularly abundant in immune pathways. ELISA confirmed that patients had high AAT (SERPINA1) levels correlated with ALT. The findings point to AAT as a possible biomarker for monitoring HBV-related liver disease development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated that reduced NOTCH1/NOTCH2 mutations elevated SAMD4B, destabilized APOA2 mRNA via 2&#8242;-O-Methylation modification. Reduced APOA2 reduced PD-L1 expression improved immunological responses. This regulation altered the tumor microenvironment, resulting in a robust synergistic immunochemotherapy that increased survival in advanced HCC patients by 2.3-fold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Research workflow.</p></caption><graphic id="d33e358" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="41698_2025_952_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">While previous researchers have discovered immunological markers in HCC, they frequently lack predictive frameworks for drug discovery. Research combines GNN-based medication repurposing with single-cell transcriptional data to rank drug-gene interactions with great prediction accuracy. This integrated method increases biomarker identification while also broadening the field of AI-driven medication discovery in liver cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data acquisition and preprocessing</title><p id="Par5">The scRNA-seq dataset <ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE166635">GSE166635</ext-link> is downloaded, containing 25,189 cells from the HCC tumor-adjacent normal tissue (HCC1) and cells from the tumor tissue (HCC2). Cells with fewer than 200 or more than 2500 genes are removed to eliminate noise from empty droplets and doublets. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> displays quality control metrics: the number of detected genes per cell (nFeature_RNA), the count of total RNA per cell (nCount_RNA), and the percent of gene expression that is mitochondrial (percent.mt). Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> is the same QC metrics with a better display of the difference in distribution. Interestingly, HCC1 has higher gene and RNA counts, and HCC2 has more mitochondrial gene content, indicating more stress or poorer-quality cells in the tumor tissues. The dataset is filtered to remove cells that had more than 5% mitochondrial content for the maintenance of data integrity. For a final dataset with ~2794 high-quality cells, the proportion of mitochondrial reads is kept at an average of 3.2%, below the commonly used threshold of 5%, thus confirming the absence of excessive apoptotic or stressed cells. The correlation of nFeature_RNA and nCount_RNA in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref> shows a strong positive correlation (0.91). This indicates that higher total RNA counts correspond to higher detected gene numbers across both conditions. Similarly, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref> correlates percent.mt and nCount_RNA with a weak negative correlation &#8722;0.04, meaning that even though the expression of mitochondrial genes changes little despite altered RNA content, higher mitochondrial percentages are a sign of compromised cell integrity.<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Quality control of scRNA-seq data comparing HCC1 and HCC2.</title><p><bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold> Violin plots of RNA features, counts, and mitochondrial percentages. <bold>C</bold>, <bold>D</bold> Scatter plots show a correlation between RNA counts, detected genes, and mitochondrial content.</p></caption><graphic id="d33e398" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="41698_2025_952_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Dimension reduction feature selection</title><p id="Par6">Feature selection is performed to identify genes that contribute most significantly to cellular heterogeneity. After normalizing, a variance-stabilizing transformation is applied, and 2000&#8201;HVGs are selected based on dispersion criteria, contributing to around 85% of the total variance. The 2000 gene selection captured ~85% of the total variance while minimizing noise from low-expressing genes. PCA is applied to confirm whether the selected HVGs have effectively captured the variance structure of the data. The initial calculation of 40 PCs is evaluated with the proportion of variance explained by each component in the scree plot in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, allowing for the resolution of the optimal integer of Principal Components (PCs) for further downstream clustering analysis, marked with a red dashed line that approximates the cutoff and suggests the number of PCs retained for further analysis.

Genes APOE and ALB had positive correlations with better prognosis, while XIST and FTL had negative correlations with survival and indicated their role as potential prognostic biomarkers. The functional enrichment analysis of the differential genes showed the involvement of various pathways, including lipid metabolism, glycolysis, PI3K-AKT signaling, and immune system regulation. In addition, TAMS was enriched in HCC2 and favored immune evasion and tumor progression. This research further supports previous evidence on lipid metabolism reprogramming as a hallmark of HCC while validating the oncogenic roles of PI3K-AKT and Wnt/&#946;-catenin pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Macrophage modulation was a viable treatment technique in HCC that targets TAMs to overcome immune suppression. CSF-1R inhibitors reduce TAM levels, whereas checkpoint inhibitors improve T-cell activity. Reprogramming TAMs with TLR/CD40 agonists or PI3K&#947; inhibitors leads to an anti-tumorigenic state. Fc&#947;R-targeted antibodies promote macrophage phagocytosis while cytokine inhibition (IL-10, TGF-&#946;, CCL2) prevents immunosuppression. Combining these approaches improved HCC immunotherapy and patient outcomes. However, it adds novel insights by integrating single-cell transcriptomics with immune profiling, demonstrating that TAMs and monocytes significantly contribute to HCC immune suppression. Unlike bulk RNA sequencing studies that overlook cellular heterogeneity, this research provides a high-resolution view of tumor-associated cell populations, revealing transcriptional diversity within hepatocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells.

Experimental validation would be a valuable next step, coupled with further exploration of multi-omics approaches that shed more light on other regulatory mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This research provides a significant advancement over previous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) research by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with computational drug discovery, enabling a more precise characterization of tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic targets. Traditional bulk RNA sequencing studies have identified key oncogenic pathways involved in HCC progression, including PI3K-AKT, Wnt/&#946;-catenin, and p53 signaling. However, these studies lacked the resolution to distinguish the differences in gene expression at a single-cell level, averaging the data across heterogeneous populations and masking critical tumor-immune interactions. In contrast, this research employs scRNA-seq to dissect the tumor microenvironment at higher resolution, finding distinct cellular subpopulations that play a crucial role in the progression of the disease, in particular, the TAMs infiltrated into the tumors that facilitate evasion of the immune system. Studies before, such as<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, have utilized scRNA-seq to examine transcriptional heterogeneity in HCC but lacked functional analysis of immune infiltration and therapeutic target discovery. This research goes beyond the previous efforts as it integrates immune profiling with survival analysis, showing how macrophage infiltration correlates with poor prognosis. This research uses CIBERSORT for immune deconvolution at higher resolutions than previous bulk transcriptomics-based immune studies while highlighting specific immune subtypes that drive tumor progression. Of significance, it identifies APOE and ALB as protective factors in HCC, whereas XIST and FTL correlate with poor survival outcomes, finding that most research either failed to notice or had not been validated in a single-cell manner in the past. Traditionally, previous studies relied mainly on rather old traditional drug screening techniques, including molecular docking or classical network pharmacology. Thus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, to a great extent, discussed the repurposing strategies of drugs in HCC but relied more on preset known drug-target interactions, without using AI-based predictive modeling. Unlike conventional bulk RNA sequencing averages gene expression across several cell populations, the method uses scRNA-seq to capture tumor heterogeneity at high resolution. While previous researchers have discovered immunological markers in HCC, they frequently lack predictive frameworks for drug discovery. The research combines GNN-based medication repurposing with single-cell transcriptional data to rank drug-gene interactions with great prediction accuracy (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>&#178;&#8201;=&#8201;0.9867, MSE&#8201;=&#8201;0.0581). This integrated method increases biomarker identification while also broadening the field of AI-driven medication discovery in liver cancer. Among the identified drugs were Gadobenate Dimeglumine and Fluvastatin, thus discovering new repurposing opportunities where previous methods, though comprehensive and validated, do not produce predictive results. Moreover, contrary to previous works that were simply based on comprehensive gene expression, this research, for the first time, employs GSEA, in combination with pathway analysis, to identify significantly dysregulated HCC-specific biological processes, among which were lipid metabolism, glycolysis, and immune functions. Although previously, lipid metabolic reprogramming had been described as a hallmark in HCC development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, here, these changes in metabolism were uniquely associated with immune evasion strategies and survival prospects. This further reinforces its contribution toward the integration of pseudo time trajectory analysis and mapping of cellular differentiation states, aspects that were underexplored in previous bulk sequencing studies. Model retraining improved generalizability by fine-tuning on a variety of datasets, reducing overfitting, and increasing forecast accuracy. Transfer learning adjusts pre-trained models to HCC-specific data, while regularization minimizes overfitting. Active learning iteratively refines predictions, whereas multi-omics integration enhances feature representation. Continuous updates ensure robustness in identifying successful medication options for the treatment of hepatocellular cancer. This research provides a comprehensive, single-cell view of HCC and forms the basis for targeted therapeutic strategies and the discovery of novel biomarkers to help improve patient outcomes.</p><p id="Par28">This research analyzed hepatocellular carcinoma&#8217;s cellular and molecular landscape using a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data set from <ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE166635">GSE166635</ext-link>. The data set included tumor-adjacent normal tissue, HCC1, and tumor tissue, HCC2, allowing for a comprehensive comparative analysis. Downstream analysis from high-quality data preprocessing, including quality control, feature selection, and normalization, provided a reliable outcome. Dimensionality reduction using PCA and clustering via UMAP and t-SNE identified distinct cellular populations that were subsequently annotated using reference datasets. Key findings were a considerable transcriptional heterogeneity between HCC1 and HCC2; 1178 DEGs were found. Pseudotime trajectory analysis suggested progressive differentiation of tumor cells, indicating some potential HCC regulators. Analysis of the cell cycle revealed that increased proliferation of cells in HCC2 showed dysregulation in cell division. Immune profiling identified that increased TAMs further contribute to immune evasion. Critical dysregulated pathways identified using GSEA include lipid metabolism, glycolysis, and oncogenic signaling pathways such as PI3K-AKT and Wnt/&#946;-catenin. Survival analysis also established links between genes APOE and ALB, associated with a better prognosis, whereas XIST and FTL indicated poorer survival outcomes. The analysis of drug sensitivity has provided information on the possible therapeutic targets and has proposed candidate treatments by integrating DEGs with drug databases. These findings need to be validated by functional experiments and in vivo studies. The tumor microenvironment was explored in depth using single-cell multi-omics approaches to better understand the progression of HCC. Moreover, scRNA-seq data integration with clinical samples helps to enhance personalized medicine approaches. Gene-drug interactions identified herein should be validated through experimental studies to determine therapeutic potential. The feasibility of a GNN-based approach in the prediction of drug-gene interactions with high predictive accuracy and promising therapeutic candidates was proved. Identified drugs such as Gadobenate Dimeglumine and Fluvastatin, reveal strong interaction with the key genes were have potential clinical relevance. Network analysis further revealed some repurposing opportunities using the existing bioactive compounds. These findings highlight the promise of graph-based deep learning in drug discovery by systematically dissecting new relationships between drugs and their target genes. Experimental validations of the presented predictions further improved the model by incorporating even more biological data for more accurate clinical implications in targeted drugs. This research was limited by potential biases in the scRNA-seq dataset, such as batch effects and technical noise influencing the results. Furthermore, computer approaches such as PCA and UMAP were oversimplifying complex data, concealing crucial biological variances. Furthermore, the lack of control trials, such as in vitro or in vivo biomarker validation and drug sensitivity, hinders the capacity to definitively confirm the therapeutic targets discovered. This research serves as a foundation for further investigations on targeted therapies and biomarker discovery to improve the analysis and therapy of HCC. The future research should mention the lineage-tracing experiments to further validate the inferred differentiation pathways.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Data acquisition and preprocessing</title><p id="Par29">scRNA-seq dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE166635">GSE166635</ext-link>) from the GEO database for HCC1 (tumor-adjacent normal tissue) and HCC2 (tumor tissue)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

The construction criteria of the graph guaranteed its highly interconnected and heterogeneous nature, where the nodes would be genes and drugs, and the edges represent interactions filtered based on known binding affinities and relevance to pathways.
