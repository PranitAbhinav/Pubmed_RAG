It is critical to identify potential molecular targets affecting HBV-positive HCC patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this study, we comprehensively utilized single-cell sequencing and external transcriptome sequencing databases to further analyze the mechanism of SLC16A3&#8217;s influence on liver cancer and its microenvironment under different HBV status. Immunohistochemical staining in our clinical cohort was used to analyze the expression difference and influence of SLC16A3 in HCC. At the same time, we confirmed the direct effects of SLC16A3 on HCC cells with different HBV status through cell line experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Compared with normal tissues, SLC16A3 expression is up-regulated in HBV-positive HCC patients, and the up-regulation amplitude is greater than that in HBV-negative HCC patients, and it is associated with poor prognosis. The validation was performed on several external validation data sets and external validation queues. Multi-omics analysis showed that SLC16A3 expression is related to the specific differentiation of the immune microenvironment, especially Kupfer cells, which can mediate the emergence of the inhibitory immune microenvironment and indirectly lead to poor prognosis. SLC16A3 can directly mediate the proliferation of HBV-positive liver cancer cell lines in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Our study found that SLC16A3 is closely related to HBV status and liver cancer, and it has a significant marker for the prognosis of HBV-positive liver cancer.

Although, the research on the treatment strategy of HCC has achieved great success in recent years, its treatment continues to pose several challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As 80&#8211;90% of the cases occur in patients with liver cirrhosis, and due to the overall health status of patients, active prevention and treatment of liver precancerous lesions are considered to be beneficial to patients with HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The culprit of this situation is the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). In Asia and Africa, HCC combined with HBV infection accounts for 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As a DNA virus, HBV can integrate into the host genome, resulting in the activation of oncogenes, as well as promote cellular oxidative stress pathway, and induce genome instability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, no specific genes have been reported for HCC patients with HBV negativepositive so far. Thus, it&#8217;s an effective strategy to find HBV negativerelated targets for intervention or prevention to prevent the progress of HCC.</p><p id="Par8">SLC16A3 belongs to the prot-linked monocarboxylic acid transporter family and is an lactic acid transporter verified in 1976. It can promote the transport of short-chain sugars such as pyruvate and lactic acid, maintaining intracellular pH and glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As an effective output of lactic acid, SLC16A3 is a key component in the glycolytic metabolism of cancer cells. Clinical data show that the expression level of SLC16A3 in HCC tissues is higher than that in adjacent normal liver tissues, and is significantly correlated with tumor size, TNM stage and patient prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Mechanistically, SLC16A3 supports the proliferation and invasion of tumor cells by maintaining pH homeostasis within liver cancer cells, promoting glycolytic metabolic reprogramming, and mediating the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].In these sites, extracellular lactic acid contributes to the escape of malignant tumors and immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recently, quite a few studies have focused on the relationship between the expression of SLC16As family in tumors and tumor prognosis and progression. High expression of SLC16A3 is found to be associated with poor prognosis of malignant tumors in many primary human tumors, and its expression level is significantly positively correlated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that SLC16A3 is highly expressed in the intestinal epithelium of patients with inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Its&#8217; underlying mechanism may be related to the fact that SLC16A3 mediates the expression of NLRP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and activates NF-&#954;B-induced IL-6 is related to the disruption of intestinal barrier function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In patients with HCC, it is precisely because HBV virus continuously mediates the inflammatory reaction in vivo that HCC can rapidly proliferate, destroy the normal liver structure, further promote the immune escape reaction of HCC, and produce antagonistic reactions with therapeutic drugs. Meanwhile, SLC16A3 is regulated by hypoxia and HIF-1a, which suggests that SLC16A3 may be a promising therapeutic target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Based on multiple results. We try to discuss the clinical value of SLC16A3 in HBV positive patients. In this study, we used bioinformatics analysis to find that the MCTs family is not only involved in the progression of HCC, but also closely related to HBV infection. It was also shown that SLC16A3 was positively expressed in the HCC group. Consistently, the prognostic analysis of 90 patients also verified that in the HBV negativepositive HCC patients, the expression of SLC16A3 in the tumor tissue was strongly increased, while the normal liver tissues were negative. Compared with HBV negativenegative patients, SLC16A3 has priority in the diagnosis of patients with HBV infection. Our findings highlight the SLC16A3 as a potential prognostic marker in HBV negativepositive HCC patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Acquisition of datasets and information of patients with HCC</title><p id="Par10">Raw counts of RNA-sequencing data and corresponding clinical information from 371 HCC patients with 145 HBV negativepositive samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/</ext-link>), in which the method of acquisition and application complied with the guidelines and policies.

We therefore first evaluated SLC16As expression in all HCC patients using a previously collated dataset. The results showed that multiple family members were differentially expressed in tumor tissue and normal tissue. It was found that SLC16A3 and SLC16A8 were significantly up-regulated in HCC patients, while SLC16A1, SLC16A2, SLC16A4, SLC16A5, SLC16A9 and SLC16A10 were significantly down-regulated in HCC group (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). In order to further identify which gene expression is associated with HBV infection status, we further compared the SLC16As family gene expression in HCC patients with different HBV infection status. The result is shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B analysis demonstrated that SLC16A3, SLC16A4, SLC16A5, SLC16A7, SLC16A8, SLC16A9, and SLC16A12 showed a trend of high expression in HBV negativepositive HCC patient. SLC16A3, SLC16A5, and SLC16A9 showed strong upregulation (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01). This indicates that SLC16A family is not only involved in the progression of HCC, but also may be closely related to HBV infection. SLC16A3 expression is not only upregulated compared with normal tissues, but also significantly different in patients with different HBV infection status, and HBV infection results in significantly upregulated SLC16A3 expression. Based on these results, we used 370 HCC data from TCGA to perform a prognostic ability detection analysis for all SLC16A family members. The results showed that SLC16A1, SLC16A3, SLC16A4, and SLC16A5 could be used as prognostic genes for HCC regardless of HBV infection. All but SLC16A4 were more significantly associated with lower survival as risk genes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C, supplement Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A).

By using Human Protein Atlas, we observed the positive expression of SLC16A3 at the protein level (Supplementary Fig.&#160;2). Similarly, we performed immunohistochemical detection on the tumor tissues of 90 patients with HCC and their matched normal tissues. The results ulteriorly revealed that compared with normal liver tissues adjacent to cancer, SLC16A3 was positive in HCC tumor tissue group (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). Paired analysis also suggests that the expression of SLC16A3 in the same patient showed a higher expression level in tumor tissue, and this difference was extremely significant in HBV negativepositive patients (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D, E).

Indacaterol has been proven to effectively inhibit the expression of SLC16A3 in tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], while Cr (VI) has been reported to promote the expression of SLC16A3 in tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, gradient concentrations of Indacaterol and Cr (VI) were selected as SLC16A3 inhibitors and activators for hepatoma cell lines (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A), and the expression of SLC16A3 was detected by immunofluorescence staining (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>B). Then, we detected and analyzed the cell activities after intervention with different inhibitory and activation intensities of SLC16A3. The results showed that after intervention with gradient concentrations of SLC16A3 inhibitors, the decline in cell activity of HBV-positive Hep3B cells was faster than that of HBV-negative HepG2 cells. Similarly, after SLC16A3 excitation, Hep3B's response to SLC16A3 expression was also faster, and its activity increased rapidly (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>C). This indicates that SLC16A3-positive hepatoma cells are more sensitive to SLC16A3 than HBV-negative cells, and we also demonstrated this through a cell proliferation assay (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>D). Subsequently, we determined the apoptosis of the two cell lines before and after treatment by flow cytometry (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>E). It was found that there were also significant differences in apoptosis between HepG2 and Hep3B under different SLC16A3 expression patterns (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>F).<fig id="Fig8" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;8</label><caption><p>HBV negativepositive hepatocellular carcinoma cells were more sensitive to SLC16A3. <bold>A</bold> The protein maps of HBV positive cell Hep3B and HBV negative cell HepG2 SLC16A3 were inhibited by pharmacological means. <bold>B</bold> Multiple immunofluorescence staining of SLC16A3 protein after pharmacological intervention, SLC16A3 (green), cytoskeleton (red), nucleus (blue). <bold>C</bold> Cell viability changes of HepG2 (HBV-negative) and Hep3B (HBV-positive) under SLC16A3 modulation. <bold>D</bold> Effect of SLC16A3 expression on cell proliferation. <bold>E</bold>, <bold>F</bold> Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis in HepG2 (HBV-negative) and Hep3B (HBV-positive) cells under control, SLC16A3 activator, and inhibitor conditions</p></caption><graphic id="MO9" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="12967_2025_6861_Fig8_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par31">It has been reached as a consensus that HBV is a key factor affecting HCC. Compared to the non-infected population, HBV infection makes the hosts about 10&#8211;25 times more risk of developing HCC during their lifetime. However, the clinical management of HCC patients with HBV infection has been neglected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], neither from the perspective of treatment, diagnosis, nor the prognosis evaluation.</p><p id="Par32">At present, the traditional image-based clinical diagnosis is being challenged because of the need for a deeper molecular understanding of HCC. Therefore, it has been a popular research direction that through gene analysis of patients' blood or tumor samples to find markers of HBV negativepositive HCC. So as to facilitate different disease management programs for HBV negativepositive HCC patients from negative patients. Here, we studied the potential biomarker, SLC16A3, used to assess the prognosis of HCC with HBV infection, and its potential biological function.</p><p id="Par33">So far, it is believed that the most cancer cells instead rely on aerobic glycolysis and convert the majority of glucose into lactate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], even if cells can generate the energy needed for cellular processes through oxidative phosphorylation of mitochondria[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The solute carrier family 16 (SLC16) is composed of 14 members of the monocarboxylic acid transporter (MCT) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. They play an important role in the transport of cellular nutrients, cell metabolism and pH regulation. In particular, MCT1-4 is believed to be widely involved in the transport of multiple protons including lactic acid, pyruvate and monocarboxylate, preventing intracellular acidification, and playing an important role in maintaining high glycolysis rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Our research shows that the SLC16A3 gene is highly expressed in HCC, while overexpression is a major feature of the transition from normal cells to tumors. These data indicate that SLC16A3 is a significant subtype of HCC with glycolytic characteristics. Interestingly, in several solid tumors, such as breast cancer, it has been proved that SLC16A3 is highly expressed in HER2-positive breast cancers compared with adjacent tissues, which suggests that SLC16A3 may be a potential therapeutic target for specific malignant tumor subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In addition, some studies support the metabolic diversity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma described by SLC16A3, and reveal the pathway of this lactate transporter supporting cancer proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Firstly, we found that the expression status of SLC16A3 was also related to HBV infection. Further, we found that the survival of HCC patients with high SLC16A3 expression was significantly shortened, and was even more pronounced in HBV-positive patients. Although research on this association remains limited, it suggests a close coupling between metabolic reprogramming and HBV infection, as evidenced by findings on multiple validation datasets. Based on our collection of 90 clinical HCC patients, HBV-positive patients with high expression of SLC16A3 in most stromal and tumor cells in HCC had shorter survival times, which is consistent with the findings of transcriptome sequencing data. Consistent with this, SLC16A3 is almost not expressed in adjacent normal liver tissue. These data suggest that SLC16A3 may mark a molecular subtype of HCC that has a poor prognosis and is strongly associated with HBV infection.</p><p id="Par35">We then used transcriptome sequencing data from HBV-positive HCC patients and HBV-negative HCC patients to further investigate the mechanism. We obtained the characteristic gene sets related to HBV infection status and SLC16A3 expression by difference analysis and correlation analysis. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these gene sets were related to cancer, protein secretion, immunity, inflammation and other functions. Further, we found that SLC16A3 expression was associated with immune microenvironment infiltration and macrophage infiltration by deconvolution calculations in HBV-positive HCC patients. This was also confirmed by statistical comparisons of immune microenvironment infiltration and macrophage infiltration by grouping the mean expression of SLC16A3 in the patient group. Through GSVA analysis, we further found the up-regulation of inflammation and immunomodulatory functions in HBV-positive HCC patients. In summary, through the above analysis, we proved that SLC16A3 is related to the changes of inflammatory, immune and metabolic processes. While we don't know exactly how transformative the SLC16A3 will be for these processes, it does demonstrate excellent signage capabilities. Generally, the transformation from normal liver cells to HCC cells will show high glycolytic metabolism, which will not only affect the proliferation, immune escape, drug resistance and other abilities of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], but also its metabolites will even affect the classification of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. As a membrane protein, the regulation and function of SLC16A3 in this context is still unclear, which may be the future research direction. In order to study how SLC16A3 affects the progression and prognosis of liver cancer in more detail, we used the dataset <ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE282701">GSE282701</ext-link> for further analysis. By comparing the expression patterns of SLC16A3 in different HBV infections, we identified KCs as a potential subgroup of action. KCs is a macrophage of liver, which plays an important role in immunity and anti-tumor function. After multiple comparisons, we found that KCs in HCC underwent multiple changes in cell cycle, complement system, immune antigen presentation, and metabolic pattern after HBV infection. Further, we identified the biological subgroup of KCs and found that the expression of SLC16A3 in the C3:CXCL1 subgroup increased sharply after HBV infection, and transcriptome data verified that it is indeed a key subgroup affected by SLC16A3 and can participate in the reconstruction of the tumor microenvironment. HCC patients with high C3 characteristics have significantly poor prognosis. C3 characteristics were also strongly correlated with apoptosis, chemotaxis of immune cells, hypoxia, autophagy and other processes (correlation greater than 0.5). Metabolic analysis showed that C3:CXCL1 had a unique metabolic pattern. This proved that HBV infection led to changes in the liver microenvironment, resulting in the differentiation of KCs, which led to the suppression of tumor immunity and poor prognosis of liver cancer patients, while the rise of SLC16A3 marked the poor differentiation of KCs.In order to explore whether C3:CXCL1 affects the immune microenvironment through crosstalk changes in cell communication patterns, we conducted cell communication pattern analysis and found that C3:CXCL1 does have different communication patterns, and its communication with monocytes is abnormally increased, and IL1 signaling pathway is the key signaling pathway. IL1B-IL1R2 is the key ligand-receptor for communication between IL1B-IL1R2 and monocytes. It has been reported that the release of IL1B can lead to the increase of systemic inflammation, immunosuppression and the emergence of pre-metastasis microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. IL1B may be the key pathway that C3:CXCL1 leads to immunosuppression and poor prognosis. In summary, we found that the expression of SLC16A3 of C3:CXCL1, a key KCs subgroup, is abnormally elevated after HBV infection, which leads to poor tumor prognosis, and affects the differentiation pathway of monocytes through the action of C3:CXCL1. The above analysis is based on the impact of SLC16A3 on tumor microenvironment. Therefore, in order to understand the impact of SLC16A3 on tumor entity, we selected HBV-positive liver cancer cell lines and HBV-negative liver cancer cell lines for further experiments, which proved that the expression status of SLC16A3 would directly affect tumor activity and proliferation. Especially in HBV-positive liver cancer cell lines.</p><p id="Par36">Since the successful approval of sorafenib, some clinical trials have tried to evaluate different schemes for the treatment of HCC, and found that sorafenib failed to improve the median recurrence-free survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. At present, sorafenib is mainly used to inhibit angiogenesis and inhibit the traditional glycolysis regulation gene Hif-1a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, HBV negative related HCC accounted for 70.7% in the ORIENTAL trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] with 6.5&#160;months of median OS. HBV infection seems to make the prognosis of advanced HCC poorer than other epidemiological causes.</p><p id="Par37">Our study has certain value for the specific target search and mechanism exploration of HBV-positive liver cancer. In the past, the screening of prognostic indicators and the research of potential drugs for HCC are often easy to fall into the target of success. Now, we need to conduct a more comprehensive and detailed analysis of tumor genomics through a variety of analysis and detection methods. This will have important complementary value for the discovery of new targets for HCC research and breakthrough in treatment. Our study found that SLC16A3 may be a potential prognostic indicator for patients with HCC, especially those with HBV infection. However, we regret that we did not further clarify the mechanism between SLC16A3 and HBV negativepositive HCC through in vitro and in vivo experiments and the significance of rising SLC16A3 for the tumor immune microenvironment. Our research still has limitations in clarifying the relationship between them, and our follow-up research will continue to reveal the nature of these phenomena.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par38">SLC16A3 is abnormally expressed in HCC patients, especially HBV negativepositive HCC patients.
