Treatment options can be wide-ranging. They include conservative methods like physical therapy (PT), anti-inflammatory medications, and lifestyle adjustments, as well as more aggressive options such as corticosteroid injections and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). In severe cases, surgical procedures like transitional vertebra resection or spinal fusion may be indicated.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Despite these options, there is no consensus on a treatment algorithm for adult patients with Bertolotti syndrome.</p><p>Similarly, no agreement currently exists for the management of this syndrome in children because of the lack of robust data in this specific population. Most of the studies published on pediatric Bertolotti syndrome are case reports and small-scale studies. Despite this, available studies emphasize the importance of early and accurate diagnosis to allow for timely management, given the diagnostic challenges associated with this condition. Quinlan et al<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> found that in patients younger than 30 years, the prevalence of Bertolotti syndrome was up to 11.5% while Illeez et al's radiographic review of 400 children age 10 to 17 years found an LSTV occurrence of 16.8%.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> These studies suggest that Bertolotti syndrome may be underdiagnosed in younger patients and if left untreated, may lead to chronic pain and disability.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In 2019, Cuenca et al suggested a management plan for pediatric patients with Bertolotti syndrome. Their algorithm involved a step-wise approach starting with pain management through medication, rest, and PT before moving on to diagnostic and therapeutic localized injections of lidocaine and corticosteroids and surgery for more severe cases.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> However, their proposal is limited given the lack of robust data on this topic. There is a clear need for a comprehensive review that consolidates the available data, addresses the unique aspects of the condition in younger patients, and offers evidence-based guidance for diagnosis and management.</p><p>The goal of this systematic review was to compile and analyze the existing research on pediatric Bertolotti syndrome. Our goals are twofold: first, to offer a summary of the clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, and treatment choices specifically for children and teenagers and second, to create a management algorithm tailored to these young patients. This algorithm is designed to aid clinicians and orthopaedic surgeons in making informed care decisions based on current evidence.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Search Strategy</title><p>The review process was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A digital search of the online medical literature database MEDLINE (PubMed) was conducted between December 12, 2023, and December 20, 2023.

Studies were first screened by abstract and title, followed by a full-text review. Studies were included if they met certain inclusion criteria: pediatric patients age 0 to 18 years with Bertolotti syndrome, treatment and outcome of each patient clearly described, and any follow-up data. Given the dearth of available studies on Bertolotti syndrome, case reports or case series with at least one pediatric patient were also included. Studies involving only adult patients or studies with mixed pediatric and adult populations that did not distinguish outcomes by patients' age were excluded. In addition, studies published in languages other than English and studies with specified follow-up periods of less than 6 weeks were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Data Extraction</title><p>The following information was extracted from each eligible study for this review: first author name, year of publication, number of patients per study, mean age, sex, presenting symptoms, mean duration of symptoms before treatment, Castellvi classification, and comorbid spinal diseases. In addition, we collected data on diagnostic and preoperative imaging, intraoperative imaging, postoperative imaging, imaging findings, and postoperative status. We also collected data on treatment options (both nonsurgical and surgical), posttreatment status (with follow-up period and recurrence rate), nonrecurrence complications, and rates of additional procedures.

Among patients who underwent surgical resection, nine out of 10 were eventually asymptomatic, with follow-up periods ranging from 7 months to 4 years. The exception was one case of a 13-year-old male with a 2-year history of low back pain who did not endorse any change in symptoms at the last recorded 6-month follow-up.

The goal of this algorithm is to provide a structured approach to diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. The initial assessment begins with a detailed clinical evaluation of a pediatric patient classically presenting with low back pain (LBP) with or without radiculopathy. The clinician should assess tenderness over the lumbosacral junction, mobility restriction, and asymmetry. Red flag symptoms (eg, motor weakness, urinary or bowel incontinence, saddle anesthesia) warrant urgent evaluation and referral.</p><fig position="float" id="F3" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Management algorithm of pediatric bertolotti syndrome. LSTV = lumbosacral transitional vertebrae, TP = transverse process</p></caption><graphic position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="jagrr-9-e25.00069-g003.jpg"/></fig><p>If no red flag symptoms are present, obtain anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral radiographs. The radiograph should be evaluated for the presence of an LSTV, as well as other conditions like scoliosis, spondylolysis, or spondylolisthesis. In the absence of other diagnoses, Bertolotti syndrome should be considered. As a next step, we recommend CT imaging to assess the LSTV in greater detail. For radicular symptoms, MRI should be obtained to assess for disk herniation or nerve root compression, and to rule out spondylolysis in patients with pain exacerbated by extension and flexion.</p><p>In the absence of other notablepathology, the first-line approach is conservative management, consisting of physical therapy, activity modification, and NSAIDs for pain relief. Targeted diagnostic and therapeutic injections (eg, corticosteroid and anesthestic) should be considered, specifically at the L5 TP/sacral articulation, to confirm the source of pain. We recommend a 3-month trial of conservative treatment with continued follow-up. If symptoms improve, continue periodic follow-up. If they do not improve, consider repeat injections or bracing treatment. For recalcitrant cases, we suggest considering surgical intervention. For small lesions, perform isolated resection of the TP if pseudoarticulation is the primary pain generator without notable disk degeneration. For large lesions (eg, Castellvi Type 3+) where resection would be radical, consider fusion of L5-S1 without resection. Nerve decompression may be considered for patients with radicular symptoms in addition to resection or fusion. A gradual return to activity is encouraged within weeks to months, guided by symptom resolution and functional tolerance.</p><p>For long-term management, we recommend repeat radiograph to monitor for recurrence or regrowth of the lesion, and clinical assessments to identify new or persistent back pain or neurological symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s7"><title>Discussion</title><p>This review aimed to analyze and consolidate existing research on Bertolotti syndrome in the pediatric population, highlighting the lack of consensus on a treatment algorithm because of the scarcity of studies. While Bertolotti syndrome is well-documented in adults, this condition is not well described in children. Specifically, this syndrome may be underdiagnosed in younger patients and thus may lead to chronic pain and disability if left untreated.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> By providing a comprehensive overview of the condition, and describing the clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, and treatment options, this review addresses these gaps and proposes a tailored management algorithm for pediatric patients.</p><sec id="s7-1"><title>Diagnosis and Workup</title><p>The diagnosis and workup of Bertolotti syndrome in pediatric patients can be challenging because of the variable presentation of this condition and the limited specificity of existing diagnostic criteria. In our review, the clinical presentation of Bertolotti syndrome in children primarily involved lower back pain, which was the predominant report across all cases reviewed, with radicular pain reported in several studies. Other symptoms included nonradicular pain, buttock pain, hip pain, abdominal pain, and nocturnal pain that interfered with walking. The duration of symptoms before treatment varied significantly, ranging from months to years, with some patients experiencing chronic discomfort lasting up to five years.</p><p>The Castellvi classification system is a widely used criteria to categorize LSTVs based on their morphological features.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> This classification was used in eight studies, with the most frequent subtype being IIa. This subtype is characterized by a unilateral pseudoarticulation of the TP and sacrum with incomplete lumbarization/sacralization. However, it is important to recognize that the Castellvi classification may be limited. For instance, one study noted that relying solely on dysplastic TP height, as outlined in the Castellvi classification, may not effectively identify LSTV anatomy or serve as a sensitive diagnostic tool for Bertolotti's syndrome.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> This suggests that more research is needed to refine classification systems for better diagnostic accuracy. Of note, Jenkins et al<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> have proposed a newer classification system incorporating radiographic anatomy and clinical relevance of LSTV variants, which may offer improved sensitivity and clinical applicability in pediatric patients.</p><p>Radiographic evaluation remains the cornerstone of the initial diagnostic workup. radiograph are typically the first-line imaging modality. This tool can also be used for children presenting with red flag symptoms such as constant pain, night pain, pain lasting more than four weeks, or neurological signs.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> radiograph frequently identify anomalies such as anomalous TP at the L5-S1 level and pseudoarticulation with the sacrum. CT scans are often used to confirm radiograph findings, providing detailed views of the bony anatomy and confirming the presence of anomalous TP and pseudoarticulation at the lumbosacral junction. In the presence of neurologic symptoms, MRI is recommended. Special MRI sequences such as Short Tau Inversion Recovery or fat-suppressed T2 can help detect bone marrow edema near the pseudoarticulation, suggesting an active pain source. Contrast-enhanced MRI may show soft tissue inflammation, and bone scintigraphy or SPECT-CT can localize metabolically active pseudoarticulations. Intraoperative imaging is imperative to confirm adequate resection.</p></sec><sec id="s7-2"><title>Treatment Options</title><p>The management of Bertolotti syndrome in pediatric patients involves a spectrum of nonsurgical andsurgical treatment modalities, reflecting the complexity and variability of this condition. Our analysis of 13 studies reveals diverse approaches to treatment, emphasizing both conservative and surgical interventions based on symptom severity and response to initial treatment.</p><p>Nonsurgical management is typically the first line of treatment, focusing on symptom relief and functional improvement. This includes rest, activity modification, and PT, which emphasizes core strengthening and postural training. This approach aligns with the findings in adult populations, where similar conservative therapies are recommended as initial treatment.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Oral pain medications, such as NSAIDs and muscle relaxants, are commonly prescribed to manage pain and discomfort.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In addition, bracing treatment with a corset can provide support and alleviate symptoms.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> These methods aim to reduce pain and improve functional capacity, enabling children to engage in normal activities and sports.</p><p>Targeted treatments, including diagnostic and therapeutic injections of corticosteroids and lidocaine into the true facet joints or pseudoarticulation, are essential in both confirming the diagnosis and providing symptom relief.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> These injections can help identify the specific pain generator as well as offer temporary relief by numbing the affected nerves and reducing local inflammation, allowing for better-targeted subsequent treatments. Notably, the facet joint contralateral to the pseudoarticulation may also serve as a notable pain generator. For example, Brault et al<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> noted that significant pain relief was achieved following corticosteroid and local anesthetic injections at the left facet joint in a 17-year-old patient with a right unilateral lumbosacral articulation.</p><p>While conservative treatment options remain the first-line approach, when they become ineffective or symptoms persist, surgery can be considered as a last resort option. Among the reviewed cases, surgical resection of abnormal structures, particularly anomalous or hypertrophic TPs, was the most common approach.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> This aligns with findings in adult studies where resection has been shown to provide notable symptom relief.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Surgery is often considered after failed conservative treatments and persistent pain affecting quality of life. Intraoperative imaging tools, such as fluoroscopic guidance and 3D CT-navigation, may be used to ensure precise resection and optimal outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> These techniques may enhance surgical accuracy and minimize complications. Posterior fusion was performed in select cases demonstrating notable disk degeneration at the transitional segment level or extensive TP bridging.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>Alternative modalities such as RFA, acupuncture, thermotherapy have been proposed in isolated case reports, however their efficacy has not been proven.</p></sec><sec id="s7-3"><title>Outcomes and Follow-Up</title><p>The outcomes for both conservative and surgical treatments of Bertolotti syndrome in pediatric patients were generally positive. Most patients who underwent surgical resection achieved complete symptom relief at the last recorded follow-up, usually a few months to up to two years. The two pediatric patients who underwent posterior fusion also had overall favorable outcomes, although one patient continued to experience symptoms like bilateral sciatica and moderate disability despite no LBP at 9-year follow-up. For those treated conservatively, many reported pain relief and resumed normal activities or sports.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> However, the follow-up periods were variable and the presence of residual symptoms in some cases highlight the need for long-term monitoring. Although specific rehabilitation protocols were not uniformly described, most patients were encouraged to progressively resume activity, with emphasis on core strengthening and postural training. Return to sports was reported as early as 6 weeks postoperatively. While prior research indicates positive surgical outcomes for Bertolotti syndrome,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> there is a lack of robust studies in both adult and pediatric populations to conclusively compare the efficacy of surgical versus conservative treatments.</p><p>Treating Bertolotti syndrome in children requires a personalized approach, balancing conservative treatments with timely surgery when needed. Understanding the unique presentation of the condition in children can lead to more effective management and better patient outcomes. More research is essential to refine treatment plans and diagnostic criteria, ensuring that children with this condition get the most appropriate and effective care.</p></sec><sec id="s7-4"><title>Limitations</title><p>This review has several limitations that should be considered. First, most of the included studies were case reports and small-scale studies, which limits the generalizability of the results. Relying on these studies introduces potential publication bias because cases with successful outcomes are more likely to be reported, while unsuccessful or neutral cases might remain unpublished. Also, the relatively small sample sizes in the included studies, combined with the lack of extensive data on pediatric Bertolotti syndrome, may mean that the full spectrum of clinical presentations and treatment responses may not be fully captured. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and provide more generalizable data.</p><p>There was also a lot of variability in the methodologies used, including differences in diagnostic criteria, imaging methods, and treatment protocols. Without a larger sample size, this makes it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about the best management strategies for Bertolotti syndrome in children. In addition, the studies we reviewed had varied follow-up periods, from a few months to several years, which could affect the consistency of the outcomes reported. Another major limitation is the lack of standardized outcome measures. Different studies used various criteria to assess treatment success, ranging from subjective patient reports to objective clinical evaluations. This inconsistency makes it hard to perform a comprehensive meta-analysis and weakens the robustness of the conclusions. More research is also needed on long-term outcomes, particularly regarding recurrence rates and the sustainability of symptom relief. Many studies included in this review had limited follow-up durations, so longer term data are essential to understand the lasting effects of both conservative and surgical treatments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we reviewed the current literature on the diagnosis and management of Bertolotti syndrome in children. Bertolotti syndrome is a condition involving LSTV that can cause notable back pain and functional impairment for patients. Despite the relatively high prevalence of this syndrome in adults, it remains underreported in the pediatric literature. Based on our review, we have proposed a stepwise algorithm for managing this condition, starting with conservative treatments and progressing to surgical interventions when necessary. Providers should be vigilant and consider Bertolotti syndrome in the differential diagnosis when evaluating LBP in pediatric patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>None of the following authors or any immediate family member has received anything of value from or has stock or stock options held in a commercial company or institution related directly or indirectly to the subject of this article: Gabriel, Dr. Liu, Dr. Ang, Hines, Prabhat, and Dr. Hogue.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>Gabriel, Dr. Liu and Dr. Hogue conceived of the study idea and design.
