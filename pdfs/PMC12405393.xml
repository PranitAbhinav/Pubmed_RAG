As a result, there is a greater understanding of the long-term challenges which survivors of critical illness face [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These challenges are complex and include physical, social, emotional, and cognitive issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Psychological problems include anxiety, depression, and symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress (PTSD). Physical challenges include chronic pain and mobility issues, whilst cognitive impairments in memory and executive functioning may affect almost half of survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Ongoing impairments can have a significant impact for the individual as well as the healthcare system and society; up to 30% of survivors will need an unplanned hospital readmission in the 90&#160;days following discharge and many will have significant ongoing social problems, such as reduced employment and increased dependency on state welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Survivorship can also have a profound impact on the patient&#8217;s close family and social network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Family members of critically ill patients are also known to experience short- and long-term problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These problems can be multi-dimensional and include social issues such as reduced employment and psychological problems such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In response to this evidence, professional organisations such as the Society of Critical Care Medicine have called for greater research in relation to patient and family outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] to ensure optimal care is delivered in a safe and effective manner. However, there is limited information or consensus on the outcomes and measures which should be examined in this research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One step to address this is to develop a standardised group of outcome measure or a Core Outcome Measure Set.</p><p id="Par7">Adopting a core and standardised set of outcomes in a particular research area has multiple benefits including enabling the comparison and synthesis of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This approach also ensures that meaningful and relevant outcomes are incorporated into studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and has been used in other areas in critical care, for example with survivors of Acute Respiratory Failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In creating a standardised set of outcomes, an important first step is an understanding and identifying the current tools and measures available, including the conceptual domains which they aim to cover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A scoping review also helps determine the heterogeneity of reported outcomes; considered together with the views of key stakeholders (for example, family members, clinicians, and survivors) a scoping review underpins the establishment of candidate outcomes and domains for a Core Outcome Set (COS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">To identify the current tools and measures used in research examining the outcomes of family members of critically ill patients, we undertook a comprehensive scoping review of published literature between 2000 and 2024.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par9">A scoping review was conducted, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist was used to guide reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] (electronic supplementary material 1). This approach was used as the purpose of scoping reviews is to map evidence on a topic and identify main concepts, theories, sources, and knowledge gaps in a systematic way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This was a scoping review and involved no human participants; as such, no institutional ethical review was required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Research question</title><p id="Par10">What study measures have been used in research exploring the outcomes of family members of critically ill patients between 2000 and 2024?</p><p id="Par11">The aim of this&#160; scoping review was&#160; to map the outcomes and measures which have been captured in the literature to understand the outcomes of family members of critically ill patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Identification of eligible studies</title><p id="Par12">There were a broad range of terms used in the literature to describe our cohort of interest including family members, unpaid carers, informal carers, caregivers, and next of kin.

We have utilised&#8217; family member&#8217; as an umbrella term throughout this manuscript. In addition to the concepts used to define the population, other search strategies included: mental health, psychological symptoms or stress, depression, anxiety, PTSD, employment, social work, welfare, strain, or burden.</p><p id="Par13">We searched the databases Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, CINAHL, and Web of Science (core collection) in May 2024 using keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH). We searched for articles published between 2000 and 2024. We choose a cut-off of 2000 as critical care practise changed in light of emerging data around for example long-term outcomes and practises related to sedation management, including the importance of family inclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The full search strategy is provided in electronic supplementary material 2. An experienced librarian (IK) designed and managed the search. All reference lists of included studies were searched for other potentially relevant studies. The search was limited to English-language publications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study selection</title><p id="Par14">We included published studies which assessed the outcomes of family members or unpaid of critically ill patients. We included all articles examining outcomes across the critical care continuum, including those with outcomes during the critical care hospitalisation and after hospital discharge. All studies explored family member outcomes; only publications where family members of critically ill patients made up more than 50% of the study population were included, to ensure that the outcome measures collated were focussed on family members of critically ill patients.</p><p id="Par15">We excluded studies which only assessed outcomes using qualitative methods (such as in-depth interviews with family members). We also excluded paediatric and neonatal populations, as their needs and experiences differ significantly.&#160;Specifically, the development of decision-making capacity, the role of parental support, and the impact of long-term sequelae on family functioning are unique to each group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. If a conference abstract was identified that appeared relevant, searches were made to identify a full manuscript; if no paper was found, the abstract was excluded. Commentaries, research protocols, case reports, literature reviews, and opinion pieces were also excluded.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data abstraction</title><p id="Par16">After de-duplication, two independent reviewers screened abstracts and full texts, with discrepancies resolved using consensus discussion (JM, VD, CB, PH, and FF).

Unsurprisingly, the main conceptual domain captured was the&#160;psychological or emotional category. This finding likely reflects the Society of Critical Care Medicine&#8217;s 2012 Post-Intensive Care Syndrome-Family (PICS-F) Framework, which included an emotional domain in isolation to represent the potential issues which family members might encounter across the patient illness trajectory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

National and international groups have endeavoured to articulate best practises to enable optimal outcomes from critical illness for both patients and their families. Organisations, including the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, and the Intensive Care Society, have overwhelmingly recommended that researchers standardise the use of outcomes across studies of critically ill populations to enable the synthesis of consistent outcome data necessary for meta-analysis to facilitate comparison across interventions, to gain understanding of their relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and ultimately to improve outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Family members and informal carers can play a vital role in the recovery of patients following discharge from critical care; improving survival rates and increasing prevalence of multimorbidity and complex care needs mean that their input is more important than ever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Yet, if the contribution of families to recovery is to be valued and optimised, understanding the impacts on those family members is also crucial. Given the significant impact family members can have on the patient, and indeed the impact critical illness can have on family members, it is key that standardised outcomes are available in this area to guide treatment decisions and understand the impact of intervention testing.</p><p id="Par40">Core outcome measure sets help ensure consistency, comparability, and relevance of outcomes across studies, improving evidence synthesis and decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Most importantly, outcome measure sets ensure that researchers include outcomes which are meaningful to the public. This scoping review has identified a clear need for a core outcome set in this area, in addition to the identification of existing measures utilised in research over the last two decades. The next step is to understand if any conceptual domains are missing from those which have been identified in the review through robust stakeholder engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Following this, the most important outcomes are identified through approaches, such as the Delphi technique, nominal group technique, or consensus meetings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Measures are then identified with a subsequent assessment of quality (including validity and reliability). The final step is piloting this standardised set in practise to ensure acceptability and feasibility.</p><p id="Par41">Despite the growing evidence of the social and economic problems experienced by both patients and family members during and after critical illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], only 35 (9%) studies captured outcomes in this conceptual domain. Without empirical data in this area, it will be difficult to understand how improvements can be made. A revised core outcome measure set should consider the importance of this domain carefully, including ways in which social challenges can be captured in a meaningful way.</p><p id="Par42">This comprehensive scoping review, encompassing over 400 studies, significantly advances the field of critical care recovery by synthesising a vast body of evidence, mapping the landscape to ensure that future research is meaningful for people involved. Our team included multi-disciplinary content and methodological experts, ensuring a thorough and robust review process. We employed a systematic search strategy which was executed by an experienced medical librarian and&#160;used duplicate screening for abstracts and full-text review, ensuring independent scrutiny of all included cohorts.</p><p id="Par43">However, we acknowledge several limitations. Despite the systematic approach to literature inclusion, eligible studies might have been inadvertently excluded. To minimise this risk, all abstracts and articles were reviewed by two reviewers independently. A further limitation is that we excluded articles which were not in English, clearly influencing the interpretation of these results and perhaps responsible for our finding that most research had taken place in the Global North. We also only included studies where greater than 50% of cohort were family members of critically ill patients, as such we may have excluded outcome measures used in broader populations. This analysis did not include paediatric populations, future research should explore outcomes and outcome measures in this population. We did not include studies that assessed family outcomes using qualitative methods. Although we acknowledge that qualitative methods are important to the development of valid and reliable outcomes, we limited this review to include only quantitative outcomes, because they can be compared, reviewed, and aggregated. Finally, although determining the frequency of use of outcome measures is relevant for mapping prior research and the design a core outcome set, rigorous evaluation of psychometric properties and feasibility of implementing the outcome measure is a critical next step. This requires intensive exploration, utilising established methodology to ensure that this is done in an accurate and comprehensive manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">In conclusion, significant heterogeneity exists in how the outcomes of family members of critically ill patients are measured in the literature between 2000 and 2024. We found that 218 outcome measures were used, more than half of which captured emotional and psychological outcomes. This review has highlighted that there is a need to establish a common outcome set for the evaluation of family members&#8217; outcomes to ensure effective and consistent measurement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="134_2025_8072_MOESM1_ESM.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 85 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="134_2025_8072_MOESM2_ESM.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Supplementary file2 (DOCX 29 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="134_2025_8072_MOESM3_ESM.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Supplementary file3 (DOCX 66 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="134_2025_8072_MOESM4_ESM.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Supplementary file4 (DOCX 24 KB) </p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM5" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xlink:href="134_2025_8072_MOESM5_ESM.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Supplementary file5 (DOCX 53 KB) </p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>This review was funded by an award from the National Institute of Health and Social Care Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR203312).
