A total of 54 patients and 104 MRI examinations with abandoned TEPW (9 cardiac, 6 non-cardiac thoracic, 89 other) were included in the final analysis. Imaging was reviewed to confirm wire presence and billing information was queried to identify hardware manufacturer. The prevalence of major and minor adverse events as clinically documented or reported by the MRI safety team was recorded. Results were contextualized based on the duration that wires were in situ, when this information was available. No major adverse events were recorded. One minor sensory event occurred during a 1.5T cervical spine MRI in a patient with wires retained for 215 days. No acute abnormalities or wire positioning changes were noted. In situ duration ranged from 3 to 8684 days, with 4.8% of patients having wires for less than 1 month. Brain (36%) and abdominal (28.2%) MRIs were most frequent. No adverse events were reported in cardiac or thoracic MRIs. Most leads, including in the minor event, were Medtronic Bipolar Coaxial 6495. MRI in patients with abandoned TEPW has a very low rate of minor adverse events. No major events occurred over 8 years. MRI should not be withheld from patients with abandoned TEPW. Routine discussion of risks and benefits should continue with recognition that alternative tests may obviate the need for MRI. The low prevalence of minor adverse events is reassuring, and risks can be mitigated by ensuring compliance with manufacturer guidelines and minimizing energy deposition during imaging.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Medical University of South Carolina</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by the Carolinas Consortium.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature B.V. 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par11">Temporary epicardial pacing wires (TEPW) are utilized after cardiac surgeries to manage arrhythmias and facilitate the transition from cardiopulmonary bypass pump to normal cardiac activity and are placed on the ventricles, atria, or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

However, TEPW or their fragments may be retained in the patient&#8217;s body due to unsuccessful extraction or clipping at the subcutaneous tissues.

They are classified into temporary and permanent types, each with distinct purposes, designs, and MRI safety considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Based on theoretical considerations, abandoned permanent or temporary abandoned pacing wires/wire can be safety risk for MRI. MRI may cause electromagnetic interference in the permanent or temporary pacing wires, potentially leading to arrhythmia or thermogenic damage due to the heat discharged from the affected wires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

It also clarifies that postsurgical temporary epicardial wires that have been partially removed are not classified as abandoned pacing leads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Despite the growing body of promising data supporting MRI safety in patients with abandoned TEPW, their safety remains a subject of ongoing debate. Some clinicians, in the absence of evidence, may overestimate the potential for adverse events, leading to unnecessary avoidance of critical imaging. As a result, patients with TEPW may be excluded from MRI examinations, potentially delaying essential diagnostic evaluations.</p><p id="Par14">While data has been promising, the available information is only in small sample sizes and often only amongst a narrow range of MRI examinations. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to present a longitudinal evaluation of MRI safety in patients with specifically temporary epicardial pacing wires across a broad selection of pertinent examinations. The authors hypothesize that the rate of adverse events related TEPW will be low and that the results will support the safe use of MRI in patients with TEPW.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects and ethics statement</title><p id="Par15">This single institution, retrospectively performed, observational cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the performing institution (Pro00135217), and the need for written informed consent was waived.

During each MRI encounter, any adverse events were recorded as part of routine documentation attached to the examination order. Life-threatening events, such as cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and major burns causing irreversible damage, were classified as major adverse effects. Minor events were defined as non-life-threatening adverse events including but not limited to mild thermal heating, unusual sensations, or pain. When knowledge of the epicardial pacing wires was available, standard MRI safety procedures and patient informed consent were obtained in accordance with institutional policy.

A dedicated MRI physicist and a nurse are always present during the scan, continuously monitoring the patient throughout the procedure. This includes real-time assessment of vital signs and communication with the patient to detect any discomfort or abnormal sensations. Additionally, lower-strength MRI, such as the 1.5 Tesla, is used, with scanning protocol and parameters adjusted when necessary to minimize potential risks. This includes reducing the specific absorption rate or modifying sequence protocols to further enhance patient safety. These measures ensure that all appropriate safety standards are met during the MRI examination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Cardiac devices</title><p id="Par23">Three different TEPW models were positively identified. Medtronic (Minneapolis, MN) Bipolar Coaxial model 6495 were the most frequently identified.

Therefore, no statistical tests were performed, and a power analysis was therefore omitted. Data was reported with medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and count plus frequency for categorical variables. Time interval was defined as the duration between TEPW placement and examination date. In the event that the precise date of the placement was unclear or incomplete (e.g., records indicating cardiothoracic surgery &#8220;May 2024&#8221;), the first of the month or year was recorded (e.g., 1/1/2024 in the event of year only or 5/1/2024).

The minor adverse event was characterized as a subjective burning sensation over the chest immediately after the localizer sequence, during the acquisition of sagittal T2-weighted turbo spin echo sequence. The examination was immediately ended, and cardiology team was consulted. Physical examination and electrocardiogram findings were unchanged from baseline. A transthoracic echocardiogram was unremarkable for acute findings or pericardial effusion. A CT chest was performed, which showed expected post-operative changes in the subxiphoid soft tissues without acute intrathoracic etiology or fluid collection. The CT chest confirmed placement of the TEPW perpendicularly oriented to the chest wall with terminal ends adjacent to the anterolateral left ventricle and right atrium. There was no looping or adjacent metallic material other than median sternotomy wires, which were intact and collinear. The patient had two abandoned epicardial pacing wires, each approximately 15&#160;cm in length.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par32">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of adverse events associated with abandoned TEPW at a tertiary center over an eight-year period of time. The results demonstrate a low rate of adverse events associated with abandoned TEPW. Only one minor sensation event was recorded in the 8 years where detailed electronic medical record information was available, adding weight to the prior literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The patients underwent a variety of magnetic resonance examinations, including dedicated cardiovascular MRI. Interestingly, there was no correlation between the dedicated cardiac or thoracic examinations and adverse events as initially hypothesized, as the sole minor event occurred during a cervical spine MRI. Furthermore, neither manufacturer, time in situ, nor magnetic field strength was obviously correlated. Most importantly, no major events were recorded over nearly a decade, suggesting that major events are a very rare phenomenon in chronically abandoned leads. Indeed, this is the largest such study since Hartnell et al. in 1997 and echoes the seminal findings on this topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">MRI is an important diagnostic modality for the post-cardiac surgery patient. Patients who have undergone cardiac surgery have a high rate of post-operative complications for which MRI is indicated such as stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the past, the presence of abandoned permanent or temporary epicardial pacing wires has been considered a relative contraindication for MRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, current literature suggests that abandoned cardiovascular devices have a low incidence of associated adverse events. Hartnell et al. reported no major adverse events in 51 patients with abandoned TEPW who underwent MRI at 1&#8211;1.5T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Gatterer et al. described minor event associated with TEPW, but their observations are limited to broad descriptors such as &#8216;C-shaped&#8217; leads causing sensory changes during T2 HASTE sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Recently a large meta-analysis of patients with retained cardiac devices included 129 patients with abandoned permanent epicardial pacing wire across 134 total MRI examinations. The authors found 5 (4.0%) minor events related to sensation in patients with retained permanent epicardial pacing wires and no major adverse events in chronically abandoned leads. However, the authors did note that there were changes in functional leads device impedance or parameter changes (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;17, 13.2%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The rate of minor sensory complications reported in this study (0.9%) is compatible with the results from the mentioned meta-analysis (1%; 95% CI 0&#8211;2%), and with nearly the same number of scrutinized examinations. Additional studies related to permanent epicardial pacing wires have failed to identify consistent associated risk factors including device orientation or specific magnetic resonance sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Indeed, the authors reported no major MRI safety hazard related to chronically abandoned permanent epicardial pacing wires, similar to recent studies on 1.5T in abandoned permanent pacemaker/ICD leads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">It is important to recognize some of the demographic variables unique to this study. Only 5% of patients had an MRI in the first month after cardiac surgery. Many of the MRIs included in this study were for routine outpatient purposes. However, MRI is an important modality in the immediate post-operative period, especially for the workup of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Promisingly, a minority of patients underwent 3&#8201;T MRI with no reportable adverse events. While the number included remains small, further study is needed as 3&#8201;T MRI becomes more frequent in clinical practice.</p><p id="Par35">There remain questions that are unanswered. Given that no single major event was recorded in 8 years, including in patients where the presence of abandoned TEPW was initially not known, major events must be a rare phenomenon. Although Balmer et al.&#8216;s in vitro study suggested that epicardial leads not connected to a pacemaker, mimicking abandoned leads, may exhibit a more pronounced temperature rise at the lead tip, their findings did not translate into clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is unknown why there is this in-vitro to in-vivo discordance.</p><p id="Par36">Our findings support American College of Radiology Manual on MR Safety 2024 Update specifically noting that no adverse outcomes have been reported to date in association with retained temporary epicardial wire fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Given the theoretical possibility of major events, it is still worth discussing with the patient with known wires before their examination as routine MRI safety protocol. The authors recommend informing patients that there is a&#8201;&lt;&#8201;1% risk for a minor sensory phenomenon and a theoretical risk of more serious complication cannot be ruled out. In addition, a review of alternative diagnostic approaches should be considered. In the latter regard, it is advisable that ordering clinicians be included in these discussions, as they can offer a more nuanced rationale for the specific clinical rationale for MRI request. Nonetheless, it is likely that the benefits of MRI will outweigh the risk for many patients. When performing MRI in patients with retained TEPW, any update to manufacturer guidelines should be reviewed. If none are available, it would be reasonable to utilize institutional expertise to minimize unnecessary energy deposition.</p><p id="Par37">The principal limitations of this study include the single institution protocolling and retrospective identification. The vast majority of TEPW were from a single manufacturer and a sizable number of patients were not able to have their brands identified because they were placed before 2016 and this information was not transferred to the new electronic medical record, or their procedure was performed elsewhere, and outside records were not available. It is conceivable that reactions in emergent patients with unknown TEPW could go unrecorded as the identification of patients relied on documentation in radiology reports, billing data, or clinical notes. For this reason, future prospective studies would benefit from multiple institutions contributing data which have different practices regarding their wire manufacturers. Additionally, pediatric patients were excluded from this study. However, there were a few adult congenital cardiac patients for which no events were recorded. Further study focusing on the pediatric population is reasonable. Lastly, there were a paucity of studies performed in the immediate post-operative period. It is reasonable to consider that there may be edema, post-operative fluid, or other factors which may influence rates of adverse events that were not captured in this study. A prospective analysis of patients in the first month post cardiac surgery would fill this gap in knowledge well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par38">Abandoned TEPW demonstrate a&#8201;&lt;&#8201;1% rate of minor complications amongst adults undergoing MRI. No major adverse events were identified over the course of 8 years. MRI should not be withheld from patients with abandoned TEPW. Routine discussion of risks and benefits should continue with recognition that alternative tests may obviate the need for MRI. The low prevalence of minor adverse events is reassuring, and risks can be mitigated by ensuring compliance with manufacturer guidelines and minimizing energy deposition during imaging.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>&#8226; MRI</term><def><p id="Par2">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#8226; TEPW</term><def><p id="Par3">Temporary Epicardial Pacing Wires</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#8226; EACVI</term><def><p id="Par4">European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#8226; EHRA</term><def><p id="Par5">European Heart Rhythm Association</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#8226; ESC</term><def><p id="Par6">European Society of Cardiology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#8226; CT</term><def><p id="Par7">Computed Tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#8226; CTA</term><def><p id="Par8">Computed Tomography Angiography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#8226; IQR</term><def><p id="Par9">Interquartile Range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#8226; T</term><def><p id="Par10">Tesla</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>JHC: Conceptualized the study design, conducted data analysis, and contributed to manuscript writing and critical revisions.EG: Assisted in data collection, and drafted sections of the manuscript.FSH: Contributed to data interpretation and participated in manuscript review.JRB: Provided substantial contributions to data interpretation and critical manuscript revisions.MA: Supported data collection efforts, contributed to study design refinements, and assisted in manuscript editing.DB: Contributed to study oversight, interpretation of results, and manuscript revisions.IMK: Supervised the project, contributed to study design, interpretation, and writing, and served as the corresponding author.</p></notes><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>Open access funding provided by the Carolinas Consortium.
