Infants and pregnant women are susceptible to it. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets produced by coughing and sneezing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Meanwhile, studies have been conducted on whether the virus can be transmitted vertically through the placenta or breast milk. Case studies published by several countries, including China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], have not found that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through breast milk. During the COVID-19 pandemic, early guidelines were developed based on the management methods during the SARS and MERS epidemics, and it was not recommended that mothers diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19 breastfeed. Instead, it was suggested that newborns be isolated and only fed with formula milk, but the evidence-based medical basis was limited. However, a cohort study in New York, USA, suggested that all mothers can have skin-to-skin contact and breastfeed their newborns after performing hand hygiene, cleaning their breasts, and wearing surgical masks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In light of this, this study divided the research subjects into three groups based on different feeding methods to observe the impact of different feeding methods after mothers are infected with the novel coronavirus on whether newborns develop symptoms of novel coronavirus infection.</p><p id="Par4">Prior to December 2022, the number of pregnant women in Sichuan Province who were infected with COVID-19 remained relatively low. In most cases, their newborns were promptly transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) following birth and were primarily fed through artificial means. Since December 2022, there has been a significant increase in the number of women infected with COVID-19, leading to a shortage of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) beds in healthcare facilities. Consequently, newborns remained with their mothers after birth under a rooming-in arrangement. Women with mild COVID-19 symptoms often perceive the infection as a flu-like illness and believe it does not interfere with breastfeeding their newborns. Although direct breastfeeding is not recommended in certain clinical guidelines, mothers retain the right to make informed decisions regarding their feeding choices, including the option to breastfeed directly or utilize expressed breast milk after being made aware of the potential risks associated with COVID-19 infection. What are the direct and indirect effects of breastfeeding on newborns by mothers infected with COVID-19? In the absence of substantial real-world data or relevant literature, the most appropriate course of action for healthcare providers is to respect the mother&#8217;s autonomy in decision-making. Therefore, through the observation of these newborns, we have acquired a substantial amount of real-world clinical data, which may serve as a reference for breastfeeding decisions among mothers diagnosed with COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research design</title><p id="Par5">The current study was a retrospective cohort study. To determine the impact of different feeding methods adopted by mothers infected with the novel coronavirus on newborns. The study was approved by Ethics Committee of Sichuan Provincial Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital on 2022(CXPJ2022-22))&#12290;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par6">In Sichuan Province, approximately 80% of mothers initiate breastfeeding of their infants. During the study period, Sichuan Province and most regions in China witnessed the lifting of lockdown measures, accompanied by a significant increase in the number of pregnant women infected with COVID-19. Based on the expert consensus recommendations, when pregnant women are infected with influenza or COVID-19, their breast milk is usually fed to infants indirectly by others. Nevertheless, most pregnant women infected with the novel coronavirus during this period presented with mild symptoms. Some of them were willing to breastfeed directly, while others opted for formula feeding.</p><p id="Par7">After delivery or cesarean section, when the mother returns to the hospital ward, the attending doctor and nurse inform her of the advantages and disadvantages of breastfeeding. Subsequently, the mother can decide between artificial feeding and breastfeeding. Mothers who choose breastfeeding can either breastfeed directly or express their milk and feed it via a bottle.</p><p id="Par8">All pregnant women and their family members in the ward are required to wear surgical masks, except during meals and when drinking water. Pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 infection should be isolated either in a single room or a designated separate area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sample</title><p id="Par9">The study included 257 newborns from three medical institutions in Sichuan Province. Although the geographical scope was somewhat expanded, the sample size still had certain limitations. Combined with the specific circumstances at that time and the policy changes after January 2023, individuals without symptoms were no longer required to undergo virological testing for COVID-19, leading to a gradual decline in the number of infections. The study was conducted during the period with the highest incidence of COVID-19, and thus the sample size holds a certain degree of reference value.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Measurement</title><p id="Par10">Within 12&#160;h, fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to detect three targets of the novel coronavirus, namely the ORF1ab, N gene, and E gene. Positive results were regarded as indicative of novel coronavirus infection. Regarding the diagnostic criteria for related symptoms, headache and sore throat were reported by the mother, while the diagnosis of fever, cough, and diarrhea referred to the 9th edition of the &#8220;Diagnostics&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Newborns were closely monitored for symptoms of COVID-19 infection during hospitalization under three distinct feeding methods. A follow-up telephone interview was carried out one week after birth to evaluate any signs of infection. The predominant clinical manifestations observed in newborns during the COVID-19 infection period were gastrointestinal symptoms and insufficient feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In cases of late-onset COVID-19 infection, common symptoms included fever, feeding intolerance, cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Throughout the hospitalization, a neonatologist and multiple nurses closely monitored the newborns for any signs or symptoms. The same trained nurse conducted the follow-up telephone interview. This approach ensured consistency in the assessment of neonatal symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par13">Data collection was carried out from December 8, 2022, to January 8, 2023. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the collection of information. Nasopharyngeal secretions were collected within 24&#160;h after admission and the samples were stored at 4&#8451;. Obstetricians performed daily physical examinations on mothers to evaluate their symptoms of COVID-19 infection and postpartum conditions. Neonatologists conducted examinations on newborns twice a day, while nurses measured the temperature every six hours. In the event that a newborn presented symptoms suggestive of a COVID-19 infection, the nasopharyngeal secretions were to be tested. Trained professionals gathered comprehensive maternal and neonatal data, including demographic characteristics, gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, birth weight, Apgar score, symptoms, and signs. Moreover, post-discharge telephone follow-up visits were conducted to monitor for neonatal infection symptoms such as fever, feeding intolerance, coughing, dyspnea, and diarrhea.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par14">Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS (Version 22.0). Data are presented as descriptive statistics, including frequencies, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;standard deviation (SD) or median with interquartile ranges (IQR), depending on the data distribution. The symptoms of COVID-19 infection among three groups of newborns with different feeding patterns were analyzed using the Chi-square test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Characteristics of the sample</title><p id="Par15">A total of 257 confirmed COVID-19 infection cases were admitted to four medical institutions in Sichuan Province, namely Sichuan Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Sichuan People&#8217;s Hospital, Luzhou Maternal and Child Health Hospital, and Dujiangyan People&#8217;s Hospital. Among the 212 cases, 125 infants were directly breastfed, while 87 were bottle-fed. Moreover, artificial feeding was implemented in 45 cases. Telephone interviews were carried out with the families of 212 newborns.</p><p id="Par16">Mothers have the right to choose the most appropriate feeding method for their newborns. After carefully evaluating the risks and benefits associated with each of the three feeding methods, mothers can decide which approach best suits their circumstances. The classification of the three feeding methods was determined based on the mother&#8217;s independent choice, resulting in a certain degree of imbalance in the number of participants across the three groups. However, no significant differences were observed in maternal age, mode of delivery, symptoms of COVID-19 infection, gestational age, or birth weight among the three groups of newborns. Therefore, the baseline characteristics of the groups were considered consistent and comparable.</p><p id="Par17">The characteristics of the participants are presented in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p><p id="Par18">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Symptoms of COVID-19 infection in newborns</title><p id="Par21">Throughout their hospitalization, none of the newborns in the three groups exhibited any symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, one week post-birth, all the newborns within these three groups still presented no signs of COVID-19 infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par22">Since the substantial revision of the epidemic prevention and control policy in December 2022, a notable increase has been witnessed in the number of pregnant women infected. The majority of these infections present with mild symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The prevalent clinical manifestations among pregnant women mainly encompass cough, sore throat, and fever, with the vast majority showing either asymptomatic or mild presentations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">The postpartum self-care ability of the mother is assessed, and she demonstrates the capacity to breastfeed her newborn. Nevertheless, during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, infected mothers were advised not to engage in direct breastfeeding. Instead, expressed milk should be fed to the infant by others without undergoing sterilization.</p><p id="Par24">With the evolving pathogenicity and transmissibility of the virus, an increasing number of mothers with mild symptoms are inclined to choose direct breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In this study, 125 pregnant women, accounting for 58.96%, independently elected direct breastfeeding as the feeding mode even after being informed of the associated risks. Significantly, no symptom exacerbation attributable to direct breastfeeding was observed during hospitalization.</p><p id="Par25">Numerous studies have conclusively shown that cohabitation with a mother may substantially increase the vulnerability to COVID-19 infection. Conversely, separating the mother from the child can effectively reduce the risk of horizontal virus transmission. Nevertheless, it is of utmost importance to recognize and tackle the potential perils related to maternal anxiety and mental health problems stemming from this separation. Additionally, the possible negative implications on breastfeeding and the establishment of maternal-infant bonding must not be overlooked. Hence, the promotion of protected rooming is highly advisable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The principal mode of transmission of COVID-19 is via droplets. By strictly adhering to hand hygiene practices, wearing surgical masks when handling their infants, and maintaining breastfeeding, mothers infected with COVID-19 can ensure postpartum breastfeeding. The benefits of this approach outweigh the potential risks of COVID-19 transmission through breast milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The study reached the conclusion that the risk of mother-to-child transmission subsequent to childbirth is exceedingly low. The primary transmission mode is the close contact between a newborn and an infected mother. Nevertheless, it is important to note that COVID-19 mainly spreads from person to person via the inhalation of droplets expelled by an infected individual during breathing, coughing, sneezing, or speaking. These droplets possess a certain mass and generally do not travel over long distances. Consequently, maintaining a social distance of at least one meter from others is of utmost importance. Additionally, the maintenance of proper hand hygiene is also of critical significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. During the hospitalization period, mothers and their families were educated on the proper handwashing technique following the seven-step method. They were advised to wash their hands using this technique both before and after touching, caring for, or feeding the newborn. Moreover, it was emphasized that they should wear a mask throughout these activities. Nevertheless, when consuming food or beverages, the mask should be removed in a direction away from the newborn. For nursing mothers who directly breastfeed, instructions on implementing seven pre-breastfeeding handwashing techniques were provided. For other parturients whose infants were bottle-fed, instructions were given for the parturients to perform hand hygiene before and after milk expression, and caregivers were educated on the significance of performing hand hygiene before and after feeding. For mothers choosing formula feeding, it is recommended to educate caregivers to wash their hands thoroughly both before and after each feeding session. Throughout the hospitalization and during the one-week follow-up after discharge, the newborn remained asymptomatic for novel coronavirus infection, which attests to the proper implementation of hand hygiene practices and effective respiratory isolation measures. Given the lack of COVID-19 symptoms in the newborn and considering that nasopharyngeal swab collection and secretion sampling are invasive procedures, the mother and her family members believed that the newborn did not show any signs of infection. As a result, they declined to have the newborn undergo COVID-19 nucleic acid testing, leading to the absence of test results. Although data collection without virological confirmation has certain limitations, the emergence of symptoms following viral infection remains a significant issue warranting further attention. This study is a retrospective cohort study, and virological testing is not required for asymptomatic neonates, as specimen collection may cause mucosal damage in these infants. The parents of the newborn have the right to decide whether to undergo virological testing.</p><p id="Par26">Multiple studies have demonstrated the detection of COVID-19 RNA in breast milk from mothers infected with COVID-19. Nevertheless, it is crucial to note that this does not necessarily indicate the presence of viable or infectious viruses in breast milk. Studies have also observed the presence of anti-COVID-19 IgA and IgG in breast milk secreted by mothers infected with COVID-19, which demonstrates their capacity to neutralize the activity of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Specific IgA and IgG antibodies against the novel coronavirus can be detected in the breast milk of nursing mothers infected with the virus, potentially conferring long-term benefits to infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These findings lend support to the recommendation advocating for the continuation of breastfeeding among women with mild to moderate COVID-19 infections. Currently, the available evidence remains insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the transmission of COVID-19 through breast milk. Nevertheless, esteemed organizations including the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the European Federation of Neonatal and Perinatal Associations, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have clearly recommended the continuation of breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">In China, there has been a significant increase in the number of pregnant women infected with COVID-19. The care approach for newborns has shifted from isolation to rooming-in, and the majority of mothers have opted for direct breastfeeding. These changes impose higher demands on neonatal care and monitoring. Healthcare personnel are required to communicate appropriate disinfection and isolation protocols to mothers and their families, and to ensure the effective implementation of these measures in order to minimize the risk of neonatal infection.</p><sec id="Sec5028"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par28">The participants in this study were solely recruited from medical institutions within Sichuan Province, thus imposing regional constraints on the representativeness of the sample. During hospitalization, the newborn showed no signs of infection, and the family declined to provide a sample of the newborn&#8217;s nasal secretions for laboratory analysis. The lack of laboratory test results for COVID-19 infection only allowed for the observation of symptomatic manifestations. The study participants did not adequately represent women with more severe infection symptoms. This study has several limitations, including the absence of laboratory-confirmed neonatal cases, the potential underreporting of mild cases, and the relatively short follow-up duration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par29">Newborns breastfed directly from mothers with mild symptoms following infection do not present symptoms of COVID-19 infection, provided that the mothers implement effective respiratory isolation measures and proper hand hygiene.
