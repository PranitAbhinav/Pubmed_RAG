Electrochemical and biological processes offer promise for upgrading waste streams, including recalcitrant carbon dioxide and plastic-derived wastes. However, the inherent heterogeneity and high energy requirements of upcycling the chemical endpoints of the &#8220;take-make-waste" economy remain challenging. <italic toggle="yes">Cupriavidus necator</italic> is an emergent catalyst for complex feedstock valorization because of its extreme metabolic flexibility, which allows it to utilize a wide array of substrates, and its ability to use carbon dioxide via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> natively oxidizes hydrogen to power carbon utilization, but its flexibility offers an as-yet unexplored opportunity to couple waste stream oxidation with carbon dioxide utilization instead, potentially enabling carbon conservative waste upcycling. Here, we uncover the constraints on carbon conservative chemical transformation using <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> as a model. We systematically examine the carbon yield and thermodynamic feasibility of mixotrophic scenarios combining waste-derived carbon sources with hydrogen oxidation to power carbon reassimilation. Then, we evaluate carbon-carbon mixotrophic scenarios, with one carbon source providing electrons in place of hydrogen oxidation. We show that both hydrogen and ethylene glycol are feasible electron sources to drive carbon-neutral or carbon-negative mixotrophic upgrading of waste streams such as acetate or butyrate. In contrast, we find that carbon conservation is likely infeasible for most other waste-derived carbon sources. This work provides a roadmap to establishing novel <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> strains capable of carbon efficient waste upcycling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Decarbonizing chemical manufacturing is critical to achieving a sustainable future, and bioprocesses will play an important role in this pursuit. <italic toggle="yes">Cupriavidus necator</italic> is a promising microbial platform for chemical production from carbon dioxide, which it natively uses to make polyesters. However, <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> uses hydrogen to drive carbon dioxide utilization, which poses some practical challenges to its use as an industrial catalyst.

Continued long-term reliance on this carbon source is impossible because its accessible reserves are predicted to run out before the end of the century [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Carbon dioxide is an attractive replacement because it can be sustainably sourced as part of the global carbon cycle and its ubiquity as a product of human industrial activities could make its use cost-effective. To date, the primary strategies for carbon dioxide upgrading have been electrochemical and biological.</p><p>In electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (eCO<sub>2</sub>R), electrical energy is used to convert carbon dioxide and a hydrogen/electron donor - water or hydrogen - into value-added chemicals. The sustainability of such electroreduction processes depends on the sustainability of the energy generation methods used to power them [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Power grids are unlikely to be able to quickly accommodate the energy demands of large-scale chemical production via eCO<sub>2</sub>R without support from the continued burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Broad adoption of carbon dioxide upgrading will therefore require massive expansion of renewable energy generation alongside efficiency improvements to existing renewable energy technologies [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In addition to these significant energy requirements, eCO<sub>2</sub>R also requires a large volume supply of hydrogen that must be sourced sustainably. Green hydrogen is often considered as a viable way to meet this demand, but the required technology for its production has not been demonstrated at an industrial scale to date [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It will thus be a significant challenge to meet the 250 Mt green hydrogen demand that is predicted by 2050. At this scale, the generation of this input stream alone would use up approximately 90% of the energy budget of the chemical sector. Moreover, increasingly limited water supplies in a changing climate will likely set an upper bound on green hydrogen production capacity [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The constraints on sustainable hydrogen production therefore represent a significant barrier to the expansion of eCO<sub>2</sub>R-based chemical production [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Even if these material and energetic barriers are overcome, the scope of products accessible via eCO<sub>2</sub>R will have to be expanded for it to be a meaningful approach to meet the current chemical product needs of society. The primary outputs of eCO<sub>2</sub>R processes to date have been C1 and C2, and to a lesser extent, C3 chemicals. Carbon monoxide, formic acid, ethylene, methanol, ethanol, methane, and <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>-propanol [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] are the most often reported products. Other C3 chemicals and some C4 chemicals have been observed in eCO<sub>2</sub>R processes but at limited production rates and scales [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Part of the limitation to producing longer carbon chain molecules is that the C1/C2 intermediates are released from the catalyst before they can be extended [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As such, producing polymers and liquid fuels from carbon dioxide remains challenging, though work toward achieving sustainable conversion processes is accelerating [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to electrochemical production methods, biological routes leverage the native ability of certain microbes to fix carbon dioxide as a way to produce value-added compounds. For example, acetone and isopropanol (C3 compounds) production by engineered <italic toggle="yes">Clostridium autoethanogenum</italic> grown on waste gas feedstocks (carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide/hydrogen) has been demonstrated at industrial scale with productivities reaching approximately 3 g/L/h and selectivities of up to 90% [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Anaerobic acetogens, such as <italic toggle="yes">C. autoethanogenum</italic>, are attractive for carbon dioxide utilization because they make use of the energy efficient Wood Ljungdahl pathway [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and do not require intensive process development for light delivery, as is the case with photosynthetic organisms [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, the strict anaerobic requirements of acetogens might limit the scope of products that is accessible via processes utilizing them in two ways. First, it stoichiometrically constrains oxygen availability, because oxygen can only come from the carbon dioxide/monoxide feedstock in such processes. Second, it constrains the amount of energy available for the oxidation half of redox reactions, which puts an upper bound on the rate of carbon dioxide reduction.</p><p>The emerging industrial platform organism <italic toggle="yes">Cupriavidus necator</italic> can instead fix carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen using a Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle powered by unique, oxygen-tolerant hydrogenases [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> has been used to produce a wide range of compounds, such as alcohols, fatty acids, terpenes, alkanes/alkenes, and organic acids [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Its ability to grow in the presence of oxygen, coupled with its inherent metabolic flexibility, makes it attractive as a host to oxidize alternative, non-sugar carbon sources, such as those derived from waste [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, its ability to fix carbon in the presence of oxygen presents a significant opportunity to engineer the energetic coupling between oxidation pathways and carbon dioxide reduction. For example, the oxidation of eCO<sub>2</sub>R-derived C1 substrates such as formate or methanol could provide energy in addition to that available from hydrogen to drive carbon dioxide fixation. However, there are a number of other waste products that could potentially be used as sources of electrons to power carbon dioxide fixation in <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic>. Plastic monomers are of particular interest, because of the accelerating plastic crisis [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and because <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> natively produces polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a biopolymer that could be used as an alternative to petroleum-based plastics [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The idea of using mixotrophic approaches to increase carbon yield in microbial metabolism is not new, but has not been explored extensively or systematically. Previous in silico work evaluated mixotrophic strategies combining methanol oxidation with the transformation of various sugars via non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG). This demonstrated that methanol oxidation can increase the thermodynamic driving force for the production of desired chemicals, while conserving carbon [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

Together, these examples demonstrate the validity and potential of mixotrophic use of carbon dioxide-derived feedstocks to reduce the carbon intensity of fermentation.</p><p>Motivated by this previous work, and by the unique potential offered by the native ability of <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> to fix carbon aerobically, we establish an in silico workflow here to systematically evaluate the stoichiometric and thermodynamic constraints on mixotrophic scenarios making use of waste-derived, chemically reduced inputs. We initially consider co-consumption of carbon feedstocks which could be derived from waste streams with hydrogen as an electron donor. Then, we consider carbon-carbon mixotrophies in various configurations to uncover feasible, carbon-conserving routes to polymer and acid production that do not rely on hydrogen-derived electrons. We show that such mixotrophies are thermodynamically favourable and identify those which improve carbon efficiency, providing a route to the design of novel microbial systems capable of efficiently upcycling waste-derived feedstocks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>Transformation of carbon dioxide to value-added products is a net chemical reduction process; therefore, it must be coupled to a complementary oxidation process.

substrates require less hydrogen for complete carbon conversion</title><p>Our focus was on the feasibility of various input scenarios, so we used PHB as a common product for comparison across the substrates evaluated here. PHB production envelopes for all models with both complete carbon conversion (i.e. without loss to carbon dioxide) supported by hydrogen-derived electrons and without forced complete conversion, generated using parsimonious FBA (pFBA) are plotted in <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>. To enforce complete carbon conversion, RuBisCO and hydrogen uptake flux were unconstrained, while carbon dioxide efflux was constrained to be zero. In the incomplete conversion case, carbon reassimilation was blocked by setting hydrogen uptake to zero and allowing unconstrained exchange of carbon dioxide. The production envelopes show that, unsurprisingly, complete carbon conversion supported by hydrogen oxidation improves both biomass and PHB yield for all operating points relative to the case with no reassimilation.</p><p>Moreover, complete conversion removes stoichiometric constraints for all C2+ carbon sources, enabling stoichiometric conversion to biomass and/or PHB for all carbon sources. As a result, production envelopes for the hydrogen-supported complete conversion case are defined solely by the carbon number of the substrate, as shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>. In contrast, when some carbon reassimilation is forced with hydrogen uptake blocked - i.e. with all reducing equivalents derived from the carbon source alone - biomass and PHB yield decline with increasing carbon conservation (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). This may help to explain why carbon dioxide reassimilation is not observed to a significant degree in <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> cells grown on fructose or succinate without hydrogen [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], even though those cells express the enzymes required for assimilation [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Hydrogen-supported complete carbon conversion is driven by a mixture of reducing equivalents derived from the carbon source and hydrogen (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), so we expected that carbon sources with a high degree of reduction (DOR) would require less hydrogen for complete conversion. Higher DOR means more electrons per carbon atom to produce the necessary reducing equivalents for carbon dioxide reassimilation. In <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>, the hydrogen cost of complete conversion per mole of carbon converted is presented for both growth-only and production-only extremes. As expected, there is a negative correlation between hydrogen demand and DOR for both growth and production modes on a per-carbon basis, as shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>.</p><p>The line in this figure shows the cost of complete carbon conversion in the case of full oxidation to carbon dioxide, followed by reduction to PHB, as is required for C1 carbon sources. All C2+ substrates fall below this line, and their distance from it reflects the relative carbon efficiency of their respective conversion pathways to PHB. Thus, all C2+ feedstocks evaluated here are stoichiometrically more efficient than C1 feedstocks, regardless of DOR, and some are moreso than others. <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> captures this differential efficiency by showing the reduction in hydrogen costs for the hydrogen mixotrophic scenario relative to conversion of the carbon source to carbon dioxide first for each carbon source. This suggests that it may be generally more efficient to valorize waste streams via specific C2+ intermediates, rather than utilizing C1 streams directly.</p><p>In the case of acetate, butyrate, and ethanol, carbon dioxide reassimilation is not required to produce PHB with full carbon conversion, since these substrates enter metabolism via acetyl-CoA, which is the starting point of the PHB pathway (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). PHB production does require reducing equivalents that the conversion of acetate and butyrate to acetyl-CoA does not sufficiently provide, so carbon dioxide-free conversion requires electrons from hydrogen. However, the proximity of these substrates to acetyl-CoA renders their hydrogen cost per carbon-mole relatively low among the carbon sources examined (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Carbon dioxide-free conversion of ethanol requires no hydrogen (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), because its oxidation to acetyl-CoA yields more reducing equivalents per carbon atom than are required to assimilate these carbon atoms. Thus, from a purely stoichiometric perspective, acetate, butyrate, and ethanol are ideal sole carbon sources for sustainable, carbon dioxide-free PHB production.</p><fig position="float" id="pcbi.1013379.g002" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013379.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>(A) Maximum-minimum thermodynamic driving force (MDF) for each carbon source for growth-only and production-only extremes without complete carbon conversion (i.e. carbon dioxide excretion allowed).</title><p>For all carbon sources except carbon dioxide, hydrogen exchange was blocked so that energy and carbon could be derived only from the given carbon source.

In contrast, production mode MDFs are variable across carbon sources, indicating variable thermodynamic constraints arising from the specific assimilation pathways of each carbon source. Regardless, production mode MDFs are positive for all yield-optimized pathways, and generally higher than those for the growth mode, indicating broad feasibility of PHB production from all of the substrates evaluated here.</p><p>Forcing complete carbon conversion with hydrogen oxidation results in significantly lower MDFs for succinate, fructose, adipate, and ethylene glycol (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). This is expected, since maximizing the driving force for carbon fixation requires maximizing the NADH:NAD ratio, whereas maximizing the driving force for substrate assimilation requires minimizing this value to drive coupled dehydrogenase reactions. Despite this, we found feasible, yield-optimized, carbon conserving pathways for these four substrates as well as all the others examined. Unsurprisingly, the C1 substrates all had the same MDF as in the incomplete conversion case, because the same pathways are active in both cases and hydrogen oxidation is highly exergonic, so it will only become a bottleneck with extreme NADH:NAD ratios.</p><p>Similarly to the C1 substrates, the MDF for ethanol does not change in the complete conversion case. This is because the two-step conversion to acetyl-CoA does not produce carbon dioxide, but it does produce excess reducing equivalents in the form of NADH. As such, de novo carbon dioxide assimilation is required to balance redox in the conversion of ethanol to PHB (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>). Even without electrons from hydrogen, the conversion of ethanol to PHB is thermodynamically feasible and carbon dioxide-negative, yielding 0.58 moles of PHB per mole of ethanol assimilated, or 116% of the maximum yield from ethanol alone. However, though ethanol is thermodynamically favourable as a carbon dioxide-negative substrate, its practical application as such is likely limited because it is toxic to microbial cells. Previous work has shown that exposure of <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> to sub-lethal concentrations of ethanol can improve PHB production by inducing redox stress that PHB production helps to balance [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As such, supplementation of ethanol may be a viable fermentation strategy, but it is likely not realistic as a primary feedstock for <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic>-based processes.</p><p>Acetate and butyrate are the only substrates for which complete carbon conversion is more thermodynamically favourable than incomplete carbon conversion. This is because they can both be converted to acetyl-CoA without carbon loss using energy from hydrogen oxidation, provided adenylate kinase (ADK) can recycle ATP to drive initial phosphorylation reactions (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>, lower panel). Conversely, in the incomplete carbon conversion case, energy for PHB production is generated via the carbon dioxide-producing TCA cycle (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>, upper panel). Thus, fumarase and malate dehydrogenase activities constrain energy generation in the incomplete conversion scenario and this constraint is alleviated by the much more thermodynamically favourable hydrogen oxidation. Unlike ethanol, acetate and butyrate are viable fermentation feedstocks [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], so mixotrophic fermentation with hydrogen should be further considered as a potential carbon dioxide-free path to bioplastic production using them.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Carbon-carbon mixotrophy can improve carbon yield and thermodynamic feasibility</title><p>Coupling an electron source to carbon reduction appears to be generally feasible, so we next aimed to evaluate the feasibility of carbon-carbon mixotrophies making use of the same coupling strategy. Our rationale for doing so lies in the fact that the carbon dioxide generated from the fermentation of eCO<sub>2</sub>R-derived carbon sources may ultimately be neutral in the global carbon balance. Therefore, mixotrophic scenarios making use of the electrons from these carbon sources could at least be net carbon dioxide-neutral, even if these scenarios require carbon dioxide production at the point of fermentation. We built 45 models capable of using each possible pair of carbon sources by performing a pairwise addition of assimilation modules to each of the sole carbon source models we had generated previously. Then, we evaluated the carbon yield and MDF for PHB production using both carbon sources simultaneously to evaluate the viability of all possible synthetic mixotrophies.

If adding an assimilation pathway reduces the driving force through a bottleneck reaction, or adds a new bottleneck reaction, then using one carbon source at a time would likely be more efficient in terms of protein resource allocation and cofactor ratio balancing to maximize driving force. The mixotrophic carbon yield should also be higher than that of either sole consumption case. For example, the carbon yield of ethylene glycol-formate mixotrophy is 0.56 mol&#8901;mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which is higher than that of formate alone (0.22 mol&#8901;mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), but not EG alone (0.73 mol&#8901;mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). Thus, transformation of EG alone is more carbon efficient than the mixotrophic scenario, so synthetic ethylene glycol-formate mixotrophy may not be worth pursuing, depending on the source of either or both of the mixotrophic substrates.</p><p>Based on the MDF criterion, ten carbon source pairs may be viable. These are highlighted in <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>. Formate, EG, and butyrate all have MDFs in multiple pairings that are at least the same as one of the corresponding sole consumption cases, suggesting that mixotrophy is as thermodynamically favourable as the single carbon source consumption. Formate is thermodynamically viable as a mixotrophic partner with glycerol, butyrate, and ethylene glycol, butyrate is viable with formate, acetate, and fructose, and ethylene glycol is viable with formate, acetate, fructose, glycerol, and butyrate. The viability of multiple ethylene glycol mixotrophies suggests that it could be an ideal carbon-based electron source. Of the mixotrophies we examined, only the fructose-acetate pairing is nearly non-viable, as it has an MDF near zero (0.57 kJ/mol).</p><p>When the carbon yields of these mixotrophies are considered, ethylene glycol-acetate, and methanol-acetate emerge as the best mixotrophic strategies. Both mixotrophies yield a synergistic effect in that co-consumption improves efficiency relative to either corresponding sole consumption scenario. This synergy arises from the fact that mixotrophy with either ethylene glycol or methanol enables all assimilated acetate to enter the PHB pathway without carbon loss for energy generation, similarly to acetate-hydrogen mixotrophy (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g002" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). On top of that, both ethylene glycol and methanol oxidation yield sufficient excess reducing equivalents to drive some carbon reassimilation - 0.3 mol&#8901;mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for EG; 0.6 mol&#8901;mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for methanol (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). As a result of both of these effects, co-consumption with these substrates yields better carbon conservation than in the corresponding sole consumption scenarios.</p><p>The EG-acetate and methanol-acetate flux distributions, shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, also highlight a pattern we observed across mixotrophies. When substrate assimilation generates excess reducing equivalents, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) runs as a futile cycle to dump these equivalents via triose phosphate dehydrogenase, which uses an NADPH, and phosphoglycerate kinase, which uses an ATP. As a result, some carbon is lost to handling redox imbalance in addition to that lost as carbon dioxide. Carbon sources that produce sufficient reducing equivalents can reassimilate some carbon dioxide via the complete CBB cycle rather than just the non-oxidative branch of the PPP. Reassimilation is possible for ethanol as a sole carbon source (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>), and methanol and ethylene glycol in some mixotrophic pairings. In all cases, redox imbalance defines thermodynamic bottlenecks in the metabolic system examined here.</p><p>If the co-substrates which are good mixotrophic pairs and can be derived from eCO<sub>2</sub>R (formate, methanol, ethylene glycol) are considered carbon dioxide-neutral, then the carbon efficiency of PHB production for mixotrophic scenarios changes considerably, as shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>.

This is because formate can only produce a single reducing equivalent for every carbon dioxide molecule its oxidation yields, so there is a low cap on the carbon yield improvement that is possible with formate as a carbon dioxide-neutral electron source. Butyrate conversion to PHB generates the remaining reducing equivalents required for carbon conservation via butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase when it is paired with formate, enabling complete conversion.</p><p>Ethylene glycol supports the most significant carbon yield improvements of all eCO<sub>2</sub>R-derived electron sources in viable pairings because it contains two carbons and its assimilation yields at least two reducing equivalents. As a result, all thermodynamically viable ethylene glycol mixotrophies have yields of at least 1 mol&#8901;mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> if the ethylene glycol is considered to be carbon dioxide-free. Though eCO<sub>2</sub>R-derived ethanol mixotrophies have the highest yields, none of these pairings are thermodynamically viable, since ethanol mixotrophies are generally more thermodynamically constrained than consumption of the non-ethanol carbon source alone (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>).</p><p>At present, eCO<sub>2</sub>R cells tend to produce mixtures of at least a few of the carbon-based electron sources we considered. Thus, it is possible that the carbon yield for a number of these mixotrophic scenarios could be much higher than the values determined here, because the carbon intensity of both co-substrates could be very low. However, this would require the product mixture from the eCO<sub>2</sub>R to contain carbon sources yielding feasible mixotrophies, which may be challenging given that ethanol mixotrophy is likely to be challenging. In the case in which all carbon is low-carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide-free, a more relevant constraint would be the rate at which conversion is possible in the mixotrophic scenarios. This would require estimating constraints on uptake rates for each mixotrophy, which is beyond the scope of the present work. However, our results do suggest that in hypothetical integrated electrochemical-fermentation processes, it might be worthwhile to &#8220;over-reduce" carbon dioxide to target ethylene glycol and/or methanol production, if possible, because co-consumption of these substrates can enable significant improvements in downstream carbon efficiency relative to other, less reduced co-substrates.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Mixotrophy with partial oxidation is a viable strategy for low-carbon dioxide fermentation</title><p>Another strategy to increase carbon yield in carbon-carbon mixotrophies is to partially oxidize the electron-carrying co-substrate into a valuable exported intermediate.

The ethanol, ethylene glycol-to-glycolic acid, and glycerol-to-3HP models all also have thermodynamically viable growth and production modes, as shown by their positive MDFs (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>).</p><p>The ethylene glycol-to-glycolic acid and glycerol-to-3HP pathways could provide the necessary reducing equivalents to drive carbon conservative transformation of waste-derived carbon sources in mixotrophic scenarios. In such scenarios, partial oxidation of ethylene glycol or glycerol would provide the electrons required for co-substrate conversion to PHB, and reassimilation of any carbon dioxide generated from co-substrate oxidation. We therefore examined each mixotrophic pairing with these pathways, with carbon dioxide efflux and hydrogen input blocked. For both carbon sources, we could find flux distributions with positive MDFs for both growth and production modes for all mixotrophic scenarios (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g005" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>), indicating that such mixotrophies are thermodynamically feasible.</p><p>Some mixotrophic scenarios with the glycolic acid model required additional carbon dioxide assimilation beyond reassimilation of carbon generated by oxidation of the co-substrate (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Acetate, butyrate, 14BDO, ethanol, methanol mixotrophies require de novo carbon dioxide assimilation when electrons are provided by the ethylene glycol-to-glycolic acid pathway. This is unsurprising for the acetate and butyrate mixotrophies, since we have already shown that complete ethylene glycol oxidation provides sufficient reducing equivalents for conversion of both to PHB. In the glycolic acid model, no carbon dioxide is generated from ethylene glycol oxidation, so excess reducing equivalents are not required for carbon reassimilation, and instead drive de novo carbon dioxide assimilation. The glycerol-to-3HP pathway only supports additional carbon dioxide assimilation in the case of ethanol mixotrophy (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Ethanol utilization alone requires carbon dioxide assimilation (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>), but coupling with both of the acid producing pathways increases the stoichiometric ratio of carbon dioxide uptake relative to the ethanol-only scenario because they provide additional reducing equivalents beyond the excess that ethanol oxidation produces.</p><p>To determine the practical viability of glycolic acid and 3HP mixotrophies, we compared their MDFs to those of the single carbon source scenario without complete carbon conversion, and to those of the hydrogen-powered complete carbon conversion scenario (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g005" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). All partial oxidation mixotrophies have driving forces which are approximately the same as the case in which hydrogen drives complete carbon conversion (&#8216;H<sub>2</sub>&#8217;), because they have the same bottleneck reactions involved in carbon fixation (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g005" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). This is not true for acetate and butyrate, in which hydrogen-supported complete conversion is more favourable, because assimilation of these substrates is constrained by ATP recycling (<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), rather than by NADH:NAD.</p><p>These results suggest that mixotrophic fermentation with partial oxidation of either ethylene glycol or glycerol could be a viable approach to carbon dioxide-free upcycling of many of the waste streams examined here. Co-production of an acid renders carbon conservation viable because it provides carbon dioxide-free electrons at the point of fermentation. Though there is a carbon dioxide cost to these electrons over the entire life cycle of the resulting outputs, reduction in carbon intensity at one step in that life cycle may be useful to reduce the overall carbon intensity. Ethylene glycol and glycerol are also more practical electron sources than hydrogen, because they are safer, and more miscible in water. Moreover, the practical feasibility of the acid-polymer co-production scenario is supported by the fact that the acids are exported while the polymer accumulates intracellularly. Biomass separation is a necessary downstream step of all bioprocesses, so recovery of both products is possible within the status quo approaches to downstream processing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec007"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that there is significant potential to use <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> as a catalyst to harvest electrons from waste-derived feedstocks to drive carbon dioxide utilization. This may provide a novel pathway to reducing the predicted high hydrogen requirement of a future circular carbon economy, while motivating the utilization of recalcitrant waste streams as inputs to chemical production. Critical to this potential is the native ability of <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> to use carbon dioxide in response to excess available reducing equivalents from the oxidation of substrates with high DOR. This allows it to address redox imbalances by reducing carbon dioxide as required to store excess electrons in PHB. To date, this ability has primarily been exploited by feeding <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> long(er)-chain molecules that induce redox imbalance from their consumption as sole carbon sources [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We have described several configurations which could enable similar utilization of <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic>&#8217;s native abilities using mixtures of waste streams instead to improve carbon yield, thermodynamic driving forces, and overall sustainability.</p><p>Our analysis shows that ethylene glycol is broadly very favourable as a carbon-based electron source because it can be feasibly combined with a number of other waste-derived carbon sources without significantly affecting thermodynamic viability, but while still improving carbon yield. Moreover, its partial oxidation yields a valuable product, but has the same thermodynamic feasibility as status quo hydrogen-coupled carbon fixation. Acetate and butyrate are also critical to achieving thermodynamically feasible, high carbon yield mixotrophic fermentation, in part because of our choice of product. However, a number of other valuable chemical products, such as long-chain fatty acids, can be derived from acetyl-CoA or butyryl-CoA with energy input via reducing equivalents derived from an additional electron source such as hydrogen. Ethylene glycol mixotrophy and hydrogen-supported conversion of acetate and butyrate should thus be explored further in <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic>.</p><p>Additionally, the partial oxidation scenarios we examined could yield low-carbon dioxide biopolymers beyond PHB without acid co-production because they generate intermediates which can be co-polymerized with 3-hydroxybutyrate. Both glycolate [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and 3HP [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] co-polymers of 3-hydroxybutyrate have been demonstrated. Thus, while the present work is limited to a single polymer product, our focus on inputs may enable future work which considers production of a wide variety of chemical products using low-carbon dioxide mixotrophies.</p><p>We did not consider any metabolic rewiring to improve efficiency in our analysis, because doing so would have expanded the design space to an impractical degree. Yet, improvements to thermodynamic driving forces via rewiring have been shown in <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and these demonstrated strategies would likely be useful to address the common thermodynamic constraints associated with redox imbalance that we found among most of the metabolic scenarios we investigated. These - and other, as-yet undescribed strategies - could be applied in the mixotrophic scenarios we have evaluated here to further improve carbon conservation and thermodynamic feasibility. The present work may help to limit the design scope for metabolic rewiring approaches, since we have shown non-viability of a number of synthetic mixotrophies. Future work should focus on the viable combinations we have elucidated, namely those making use of acetate and butyrate for carbon and ethylene glycol or methanol for reducing equivalents.</p><p>Practically, achieving mixotrophy in a <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> platform - or any microbe, for that matter - will be challenging. In the wild, access to single carbon sources is often limited; a ready supply of two or more at the same time would be exceedingly rare. As such, complex metabolic regulatory systems have evolved to prioritize the use of limited cellular resources for sequential carbon source utilization over co-consumption. These regulatory systems present a significant barrier to achieving the proposed synthetic mixotrophies. Despite these challenges, synthetic, carbon dioxide-utilizing mixotrophy has been demonstrated in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> previously [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">C. necator</italic> may be a better platform for the establishment of synthetic mixotrophy than other industrial microbes because it seemingly maintains continual expression of proteins required for assimilation of many different carbon sources in preparation for environmental shifts [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, it is still known to use global regulators to prioritize high-quality carbon sources over low-quality ones [<xref rid="pcbi.1013379.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Moreover, regulation of PHB production is known to be influenced by nutrient availability, which may have unintended interactions with the proposed assimilation pathway. Thus, experimental work to understand how global regulators could be manipulated and/or circumvented will likely be required to build strains capable of the mixotrophies proposed here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Curation of complementary feedstocks</title><p>A literature search was performed to establish a list of compounds which could reasonably be used mixotrophically.

Similarly, the biomass and PHB reactions were excluded because, as terminal reactions that inherently do not operate at steady-state, it is not clear how they can be included in the MDF framework. Biomass and PHB accumulation are known to occur spontaneously, so it was assumed that they are thermodynamically feasible in the conditions examined.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Carbon-carbon mixotrophic performance</title><p>Mixotrophic models were constructed through pairwise addition of consumption modules to each sole carbon source model, without repeat, since the order in which the consumption modules are combined does not matter (e.g. ethylene glycol-acetate is the same as acetate-ethylene glycol). Uptake rates for each carbon source were constrained to a maximum of 1 mmol&#8901;gCDW<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#183;h<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, such that a total uptake rate of 2 mmol&#8901;gCDW<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#183;h<sup>&#8722;1</sup> was possible in each mixotrophic case.

All reactions shown in red operate at this MDF. In the complete conversion scenario, hydrogen oxidation provides sufficient reducing power for all of the assimilated butyrate to be converted to PHB with no carbon dioxide generation, and therefore no reassimilation required.

<bold>Comments to the Authors:</bold>

<bold>Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.</bold>
</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Please find my review comments uploaded as an attachment.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Summary:</p><p>The authors assess the possibility to use additional carbon/energy sources other than CO2 and H2 to produce biomass or PHB in the chemolithoautotroph Cupriavidus necator. The primary motivation is the limitation of H2 as energy source and the possible difficulties to supply it in the required amounts, while alternative energy (and carbon) sources could be generated from waste streams. The authors investigate various scenarios from basic growth on CO2 + H2 to re-assimilation of emitted CO2 using extra reducing power, to various mixotrophic scenarios (carbon source + H2, two carbon/energy sources).</p><p>General evaluation:</p><p>The manuscript is overall highly interesting and presents results that are very relevant for the metabolic engineering community. The manuscript is well written with some exceptions outlined in the specific comments. The modeling that was used to investigate mixotrophy is appropriate for these questions and the data that is presented is convincing. However, the methods and results presented here are quite complex and the information density is high. The manuscript can certainly benefit from focusing on the main findings and improving the presentation in the figures. Also, ordering and highlighting important findings can be improved as outlined in the comments below.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>Figure S1A: is it really possible that yield is constant for nearly all substrates regardless how much of it is re-cycled through Rubisco? This feels counter-intuitive, I would expect a similar picture as for fructose, because full oxidation of the C source and re-uptake of CO2 should mean increased energy cost.</p><p>Figure 1C: x-axis labels should be shifted to the left such that their ends align better with the bars. This applies to most of the other bar charts as well.</p><p>Figure 4: the difference to Figure 3A (yield) is not entirely clear. The only parameter that changes in Figure 4 is that one of the 2 mixotrophic substrates is considered carbon-neutral (or negative), and thus changes the yield for the better? It is questionable if such a small change in the scenario warrants an extra figure, it could be added as a sub-figure to figure 3. Please also use the same color code for the yield heatmaps in figures 3 and 4.</p><p>L99: "CO2 flux was costrained to zero" -- there must be CO2 uptake flux in the case of CO2 acting as substrate, consider changing to "CO2 efflux" or "CO2 emission" was constrained</p><p>L101: "complete carbon conservation supported by H2 oxidation improves both biomass and PHB yield" -- Figure 1B shows the opposite: dashed line, without reassimilation, shows higher yield for PHB and biomass in all conditions</p><p>L162: "PHB production from EG and ethanol is only thermodynamically feasible when RuBisCO flux is allowed" -- this finding is in contrast to the other substrates where Rubisco rather needs to be blocked to obtain thermodynamically feasible driving force. Can the authors speculate why this is different for these two C2 substrates?</p><p>L179: "Therefore, for most carbon sources, CO2-free fermentation via carbon reassimilation is unlikely to be practically achievable, even if it may be thermodynamically feasible." -- A highly interesting conclusion; can the authors maybe elaborate what 'thermodynamically unfavorable' would practically mean? Because a yield on substrate benefit through CO2-reassiilation would mean a strong *evolutionary* driving force. But I assume that when the MDF for this pathway is low, the practical consequence would mean increased enzyme cost to catalyze the reaction, and considerable reverse flux?</p><p>L204: "Since CO2-free carbon-H2 mixotrophy is generally infeasible for the carbon sources examined here" -- this is a contradiction to the previous paragraph where you actually show that H2-assisted acetate growth is a viable solution. Consider rephrasing.</p><p>L269-: In this entire paragraph, the authors jump between figures and results quite a bit. It starts with Figure 5E , then goes to 5B, 5E again and then 5A. Please consider reordering this section such that the reader is guided from figures 5A to 5G in the right order.</p><p>For example in line 293: "Remarkably, the MDF for production in both partial oxidation models is</p><p>significantly higher than that of the CO2/H2 baseline, even though these models uses the same route for CO2 assimilation." -- what sub-figure results is this part referrring to? The CO2/H2 base line is not included in Figure 5 as far as I can tell.</p><p>The entire section about mixotrophy with partial oxidation of EG and Glycerol is difficult to understand, not the least because the scenarios investigated are quite complex (co-feeding EG or glycerol, CO2 or another carbon substrate, with or without H2 supplementation, with or without permission to emit CO2, etc). This section and the corresponding figure 5 could benefit from focusing only on the main findings, improving the links between text and sub-figures, and maybe improving guidance in the figure itself, e.g. having a schematic which carbon and energy sources and emission type is used for which bar chart. The flux maps are generally of high quality but lack this type of guiding information. For example in figure 5B it is clear that EG is a co-substrate and that conversion is blocked at the GDH enzyme. But to which scenarios of the bar chart in Figure 5C do the flux values correspond? Is CO2 fixed (re-assimilated), and does it come from the oxidized carbon substrate? Is H2 used, and where in the flux map would it appear? Colored inputs corresponding to the scenarios in Figure 5C/D could help here.</p><p>For the discussion, it might be worthwhile to add a comment regarding toxicity of substrates and products when it comes to the practical implementation of mixotrophic strategies. Likewise, complete flux to product is unrealistic yet used in many of the simulations. The authors should discuss (briefly) if and how the whole cell catalyst could switch from growth to production, and what difficulties could arise from that regarding product yield, viability, etc. This is not the focus of the paper and does not need to be extensive, but it should be made clear that metabolic modeling can be far from reality.</p><p>**********</p><p>

<bold>Comments to the Authors:</bold>
</p><p>
<bold>Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.</bold>
</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;The updated manuscript addresses all major and minor points sufficiently. Nonetheless, I have further comments to parts of the manuscript which I believe could clarify certain results and their description/presentation. This can be done easily with few additional sentences or small fixes.</p><p>1. A more detailed explanation as to what the difference between the results displayed in Figure 1C/1E and Figure S2 are.</p><p>2. Line 214: Acceptable reasoning regarding efficient protein allocation, but the &#8220;cofactor balancing&#8221; might need a sentence (or half-sentence) more of an explanation as to how it&#8217;s connected to the MDF. Cofactor balancing is usually a stoichiometric issue.</p><p>3. Fig 3B and 3C are not referred to in the manuscript text</p><p>4. Inconsistencies between line 290 vs 292 vs 304: EG and glycerol are first introduced as carbon sources, then declared &#8220;solely as electron sources&#8221;, then referred to as carbon sources again.</p><p>5. Method section &#8220;Carbon-hydrogen mixotrophy&#8221; (lines 416-430): If hydrogen cost (Fig 1E and others) is determined via v_Rubisco, but v_Rubisco is no required for acetate, EtOH and butyrate (line 128), how does the resulting number for hydrogen cost comes to be for these compounds?</p><p>6. S1B mentioned before S1A</p><p>7. I recommend naming of figures in the supplementary information as &#8220;S1&#8221;, not just &#8220;1&#8221;, to be consistent with naming in the main manuscript</p><p>8. Line 314: Figure 2C does not any longer refer to EtOH, but rather acetate. Please check manuscript thoroughly for further such outdated references from older versions of the manuscript.</p><p>Typos and such:</p><p>Generally, check manuscript again for typos, missing words, inconsistencies.</p><p>- Overall consistency in the text regarding abbreviations vs written (e.g. methanol vs MeOH, or EG vs ethylene glycol)</p><p>- Line 191: missing start of sentence (&#8220;This&#8221;?)</p><p>- 240: CBB cycle</p><p>- Line 258: &#8220;mixotrophies high the highest yields&#8221;</p><p>- Lines 376 and 377 &#8220;it is still known to use&#8221;, &#8220;is known to influenced by&#8221;</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;The authors have addressed the criticism and sufficiently improved the manuscript.</p><p>**********</p><p>
