A partnership of a health and care network and filmmakers developed an interactive film for youth wellbeing. While such films have potential as a cost-effective preventative tool, their effectiveness remains unproven. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a randomised controlled trial of the interactive film intervention to improve wellbeing in school-aged youth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In a mixed-methods cluster randomised feasibility trial in North East England (2021&#8211;2022), students in years 10 (14&#8211;15&#160;years) and 12 (16&#8211;17&#160;years) from three schools were recruited and randomised to the following conditions: (1) watching the film in class, (2) watching the film in class with support from youth workers or (3) regular class activities. Feasibility outcomes included willingness of schools to participate, participant recruitment, and retention, which were assessed quantitatively and qualitatively. Data were analysed descriptively and with the use of thematic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">School recruitment targets were met, although this was challenging due to resource constraints and the COVID-19 pandemic. Questionnaires were completed before watching the film by 172 students (48% of the recruitment target). Follow-up targets for retention were met at 3&#160;months (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;138) and 6&#160;months (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;136). Retention of year 10 students was high (96%), but year 12 students had lower retention (60%). Qualitative findings showed students and teachers supported the intervention and trial and measurements; however, consent-taking required more time. Communication and resource issues within schools were challenging and need addressing before moving to a larger trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Although some trial aspects were feasible and acceptable, particularly the intervention, others, such as recruitment, retention and school communication, posed challenges. We recommend future feasibility studies should address barriers such as randomisation, communication with schools, recruitment of older students (16&#8211;18&#160;years), consent and measurement alignment before moving to a larger-scale trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT06807931">NCT06807931</ext-link>.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par13">Adolescence is a period of heightened vulnerability for the onset of mental illness, with 75% of all mental health problems established before 18&#160;years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Mental illness can impact young people&#8217;s ability to navigate the stresses of adolescence, leading to isolation, diminished self-esteem, and academic struggles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Unaddressed, these issues may persist into adulthood, becoming more severe and chronic, with consequences for physical health, social adjustment, and economic productivity across the life course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Beyond individual outcomes, early mental health difficulties can have long-term consequences that shape life trajectories, reducing opportunities for education, employment, and social participation, which can ultimately limit the chance to lead fulfilling and independent lives. These cumulative effects contribute to broader social and economic inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In 2020, a UK national survey showed that one in six young people (aged 5&#8211;19) had a probable mental health condition&#8212;an increase from one in nine young people in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Rising levels of mental ill health may be partly attributed to increased reporting and awareness. Strategies to tackle what may be framed as a mental health crisis emerge at pace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] including school-based mental health programmes, counselling services, and de-stigmatisation campaigns. However, adolescents still lack a good understanding of the experience, impact, and management of mental health, which results, as recent systematic reviews show, in negative attitudes towards available support and a reluctance to seek help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Film-based interventions may improve mental health literacy because of their potential to engage and be emotionally impactful, which could help young people understand human experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but the effectiveness of such interventions has been given little scrutiny and there is a lack of evidence on the feasibility of deploying such interventions in schools. Difficulties to implement such interventions include the practicalities of executing interventions in complex, dynamic settings, which can introduce issues with selection, performance, and detection bias. Ethical challenges are also typical in the school environment, particularly when obtaining informed consent or ensuring equitable access to interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Finally, health and education research systematically assesses the effectiveness of innovative approaches using randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, this research methodology is troubled by the challenge of conducting work in real-life school environments and needs to be trialled before being implemented on a large scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Taken together, these challenges require careful consideration and planning to deliver and evaluate the intervention in school settings. Assessing the viability of recruitment, implementation, and measures underscores the significance of feasibility studies as an important preliminary stage for evaluations using RCTs in naturalistic settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim and objectives</title><p id="Par14">The primary aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a randomised controlled trial of an interactive film intervention aiming to build resilience, enhancing mental wellbeing and help-seeking attitudes for young people (14&#8211;18&#160;years) in schools located in deprived areas of the North East and North Cumbria (NENC).</p><p id="Par15">The specific objectives of the study were.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par16">To assess the feasibility of delivering a brief interactive film intervention in school settings with a three-arm randomisation at the school level.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par17">To explore the suitability of measuring the selected parameters (e.g. recruitment, retention) of the trial with a view to developing a large-scale trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par18">To explore views and experiences of young people on acceptability and feasibility of the trial and the film intervention through using a qualitative design.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">To gather preliminary data on the effectiveness of a brief interactive film intervention in school settings to enhance resilience, help-seeking attitudes and mental wellbeing in young people.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par20">This study adheres to the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) extension for pilot and feasibility trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p id="Par21">Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Sunderland Research Ethics Group in September 2021 (reference number 009976). Each participating school received a payment of &#163;750 to compensate for the time, effort and resources involved. Students received a &#163;5 retail gift voucher at each quantitative data collection point. Students who participated in focus groups received an additional &#163;5 voucher to acknowledge their time and effort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Patient and public involvement (PPI)</title><p id="Par22">To inform the design of this study, we invited young peoples from the NENC region to take part in seven meetings held between August 2021 and September 2022. The number of young people attending each meeting varied between one and eight. Two sessions were originally planned with three participants each, but only one participant was able to attend in both cases. As these sessions were held online and the young person had taken time out to attend, the sessions proceeded, as their input was still considered valuable. These sessions focused on trial design, including recruitment, data collection, and dissemination, as well as feedback on the film. Participants also gained research skills, covering topics including developing research questions and methods.</p><p id="Par23">PPI activities were also conducted towards the end of the study, in July 2023. Creative methods including card sorting and ranking and an effort-impact matrix were used with nine young people to explore key study elements and develop recommendations on developing resources for future research and strategies for sharing findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The PPI work underwent external evaluation by Investing in Children (IiC), an independent children&#8217;s rights organisation based in the North East of England, and achieved the quality standards necessary to receive the Dialogue and Change award. This award acknowledges research projects that actively involve individuals with lived experience, particularly children and young people. This was a pilot scheme that was developed by the funder in collaboration with IiC to evaluate the impact of public involvement and community engagement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par24">A mixed-methods feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted with three arms to assess the feasibility and acceptability of intervention delivery and study procedures. Progression criteria, including a qualitative process evaluation to provide context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], were developed to evaluate feasibility and readiness for a definitive trial based on the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], including school recruitment and randomisation (at the <italic toggle="yes">school</italic> level for a cluster-randomised trial), participant recruitment and retention, consent-taking, data collection tools, data analysis, intervention acceptability and delivery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par25">Three schools located in the NENC region and identified by the NENC Child Health and Wellbeing Network, were contacted by telephone and email to engage with head teachers. We aimed to select, from the pool of potential schools, three schools with approximately comparable Mean Socio-economic Status (SES) scores based on the proportion of children entitled to free school meals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par26">Participants were recruited from years 10 (aged 14&#8211;15&#160;years) and 12 (aged 16&#8211;17&#160;years) from participating schools. Years 11 and 13 were not targeted because of exam preparation, particularly in light of COVID-19 disruption. Schools were asked to identify classes within these year groups. Participant information and consent/assent forms were provided by the schools to students and parents of year 10 students. Year 10 and 12 students who provided written informed consent/assent, and year 10 students who received parental consent, were invited to complete baseline measures. No other eligibility criteria were applied. Since year 12 students were 16&#160;years old and older, they did not require parental consent. For the qualitative evaluation, all participants who had completed the baseline measures were invited to take part in focus groups to share their perspectives on the trial procedures and the intervention&#8217;s impact. A researcher explained the purpose of the focus groups during a classroom session, making clear that participation in both the trial and focus groups was voluntary and that individuals could withdraw at any time.</p><p id="Par27">As this was a feasibility study, a formal sample size calculation was not required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Informed by evidence indicating a median sample size of 36 per arm (range 10 to 300) in UK feasibility trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], we adopted a pragmatic approach, aiming for a sample size of 120 adolescents per school (i.e. 360 in total). Within each participating school, we aimed for an approximately equal distribution between year 10 and year 12 participants. This target was considered achievable within the study timeline and available budget.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study intervention</title><p id="Par28">In 2019, the NENC Health &amp; Wellbeing Network commissioned TryLife to make an interactive film co-produced with young people in 2021.

TryLife is designed to simulate real-life situations and challenges, allowing young people to explore different paths and outcomes based on the decisions they make for the characters in the story. Multiple public health issues are integrated into the films, including mental health and wellbeing. The film series that was commissioned and included in the trial was &#8216;Jessica&#8217;s Story&#8217;, which focused on the intersection between young parenthood and perinatal mental health, as well as other public health issues relevant to young people, including domestic violence and help-seeking behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par29">The three participating schools were randomly assigned by a researcher using a number generator using block randomisation (with a single block of 3) to one of three intervention conditions:</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Interactive film (IF)</title><p id="Par30">Participants in this condition engaged in two class sessions wherein they watched the interactive film facilitated by a teacher.

This scale has been developed and validated as a measure of the degree of resilience and for screening participants according to the level of resilience (i.e. high, intermediate or low).

This tool has been validated and has four sub-scales: recognition of personal need for professional help, tolerance of stigma associated with psychological help, interpersonal openness, and confidence in mental health professionals.

This scale has been validated and is used in the UK and worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Baseline data were collected in November 2021, 3-month follow-up between March and May 2022, and 6-month follow-up between May and July 2022.

from this feasibility study indicated that three of the seven progression criteria offered a strong indication to proceed (full target achieved), four showed a medium indication (partial target achieved), and none raised concerns about moving forward (non-achievement target). These findings suggest that it is feasible to recruit schools, retain participants, that the intervention and its implementation were acceptable, and that the use of data collection measurements were feasible. However, before conducting a fully powered randomised controlled trial, findings also suggest that certain methods, such as school randomisation, participant recruitment, clarity of consent procedures, and the applicability of outcome measures, must be reviewed.</p><p id="Par75">While we successfully recruited the required number of schools, this recruitment was challenging, and there was no surplus, leaving no flexibility had any schools withdrawn. Although one participating school had some existing links with the hosting University through outreach activities, these activities had been delivered by a different team and were unrelated to the research. While this prior connection may have provided some familiarity, it is unlikely to have directly influenced the school&#8217;s decision to participate. Nonetheless, this context should be considered when interpreting the feasibility of school recruitment in this study.</p><p id="Par76">Lack of resources to deliver the film might have acted as a barrier to randomisation. In this feasibility study, intervention delivery was adjusted to a certain extent to schools&#8217; capability of delivering the intervention (e.g. participants used their phones to watch the film). However, these adjustments were not considered at the initial recruitment stage. In a review, school resources have been highlighted as an issue for delivering mental health promotion interventions in schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], suggesting that interventions must adapt to school culture and resources, while supporting the outcome benefits. However, in our study, although school resources affected one school&#8217;s willingness to be randomised, this did not impact recruitment as we reached our sample target.</p><p id="Par77">We had aimed to match schools in terms of SES as there is a relation between young people&#8217;s mental health and deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, some diversity between schools&#8217; SES was observed in our study, which used a pragmatic approach. Exploring a gradient of school SES might be needed to understand the acceptability of the intervention, since there is evidence that mental health interventions might need to be adapted to target low-SES populations, including booster sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par78">Recruitment of participants was around 50% of our target, with a higher proportion of females in all groups. A few students believed that some of their peers chose not to participate in the study because of a lack of understanding of the study. Teachers also shared that the study&#8217;s details could have been clarified verbally in greater depth. This is supported by the qualitative data with students which indicated some study participants wanted more in-depth information about the video and the study. Although every effort had been made to produce easily accessible and age-appropriate documentation to explain the study, crucial to informed consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], time for researchers to verbally explain the study was limited. Data collection, including obtaining consent, was constrained by the tight school timetable, leaving researchers dependent on the availability and cooperation of teachers. Logistical challenges during a school-based intervention, including time constraints, have been found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, teachers thought that the way that student recruitment was conducted was appropriate, and students who agreed to participate wanted to continue and engage with the study.</p><p id="Par79">Although baseline recruitment did not reach the pre-specified target, retention of participants at 3- and 6&#160;months was adequate, meeting the progression criterion. The IF group surprisingly slightly increased from baseline to 3&#160;months (5% increase), possibly due to participants consenting to participate but not attending baseline data collection. As data were collated and analysed by groups, it could not be known who these individuals were, which is a study limitation. However, in feasibility studies, analysing data at group level rather than individual level can be appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The attrition rates varied according to the study arm, being higher in IFYWS. Reasons for higher attrition in this particular group were not explored but could be related to intervention acceptability or measurements for this specific school due to cultural or environmental factors and impacting the internal validity. However, given that there was only one school in each arm, the most likely reason is chance. In future studies, different attrition rates between intervention arms should be further explored through qualitative methods, and analysed using statistical approaches such as intention-to-treat and multiple imputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par80">There was a drop in participant numbers in the first 3&#160;months, primarily among year 12 students who were preparing for or discontinued their A-levels. In hindsight, choosing year 12 may therefore not have been suitable. Researchers need to address the logistical challenges of working with schools by implementing robust procedures to gather information on school scheduling and curricula before the study starts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Establishing open communication with a designated staff member who had protected time to support the research project would help address logistical challenges as they emerge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par81">Regarding acceptability of measurements, participants found questionnaires relatively easy to understand and low burden, contributing to a high response rate (over 95%). Teachers viewed the measurements as a potential platform for discussion about broader mental health issues. However, some students questioned the questionnaires&#8217; relevance to the intervention. The questionnaires covered help-seeking, resilience, and wellbeing, while the film (intervention) aimed to raise awareness of young parenthood. While help-seeking, resilience, and wellbeing were underpinning themes in the film, its primary focus on young parenthood may have obscured these underlying issues for some viewers. Given more time and different circumstances, it might have been possible to align the measures more closely with the intervention&#8217;s focus. However, pandemic-related delays in the film&#8217;s production, communication challenges, and the selection of study outcomes and data collection measures before film completion posed significant constraints. Future interventions should tailor outcomes more specifically to mental health issues targeted by the intervention.</p><p id="Par82">The intervention&#8217;s content, particularly the follow-up discussion, was seen as positive by students, and suggestions for addressing other mental health issues could use a similar approach. However, participants indicated they preferred that this type of intervention be delivered at school rather than at home because they felt some discomfort discussing these topics with parents. It has been reported that dropout rates in mental health interventions at home are significantly higher compared to a school intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Therefore, school settings might be ideal for intervention delivery of this type. Students enjoyed the intervention delivery by youth workers; however, they also found teacher delivery acceptable. A systematic review found no difference in outcomes between teacher and external intervention delivery, with students appreciating both the relatability of external facilitators and the trusted presence of teachers&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Considering scalability, teacher delivery may be a viable option.</p><p id="Par83">Researchers were concerned about the risk of contamination of the control group, since the TryLife films were in the public domain when the study started. However, only one control participant was aware of the intervention, indicating that the dissemination of TryLife should be intensified to reach the target population.</p><p id="Par84">The strengths of this study include use of a mixed-methods approach and validated questionnaires. However, this study has some limitations inherent to feasibility studies, such as limited statistical power and imbalances in baseline scores, influenced by differences between schools, such as the gender imbalance in participating classes. Future research could use targeted strategies to recruit more male students. Our approach to determining the sample size was pragmatic, informed by evidence available at the time of proposal development, which reported a median of 36 participants per arm (range 10&#8211;300) in UK feasibility trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. While this offered a useful benchmark, we acknowledge that more recent guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]) offers a more structured, progression-criteria-driven approach to sample size justification in feasibility studies, which could have strengthened our work and may be particularly valuable in informing a future definitive trial.</p><p id="Par85">Particular contextual factors also affected project feasibility. Data collection started in November 2021, when students were just returning to school after the COVID-19 lockdown. Although students or teachers did not mention this during interviews, conducting the study was challenging, largely due to pandemic-related delays and the significant impact on schools still recovering from the pandemic. Communication issues with schools, staff turnover, and unplanned absences, both in schools and within the research team, created additional obstacles. Key contacts in schools left their roles, and illness among school staff as well as the research team further reduced available personnel, straining the team and hindering progress. The difficulties of conducting research within the complex environment schools had to operate in during and after the pandemic are well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Recommendations for future studies include improved communication with schools and ensuring a dedicated teacher is allocated sufficient time to support the project. Co-production and ensuring key stakeholders from within all recruited schools are involved from the start, including study design and planning, may have prevented some of the issues.</p><p id="Par86">Other recommendations include providing additional support to schools with the technology required to deliver the project and adopting a flexible approach to deliver the intervention to suit the school&#8217;s needs. However, the &#8220;active ingredients&#8221; of the intervention should be maintained, such as the discussion following the interactive film delivery, and the role of youth workers should be explored further in follow-up studies. Other recommendations include the use of a variety of interactive films to tackle different mental health problems faced by adolescents and involve teachers and students in the selection of mental health issues. The intervention needs to be trialled in more school settings, perhaps investigating more in-depth intervention feasibility in schools at different socio-economic levels. Likewise, measurement tools must match what has been delivered in the intervention, as highlighted by students and reported in the preliminary data analysis.</p><p id="Par87">In conclusion, while the intervention appears feasible and acceptable, its effectiveness as a tool for supporting wellbeing, resilience, and help-seeking behaviour requires further investigation. Conducting a school-based RCT is possible but challenging, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic, which created barriers not fully captured in the feasibility data. Four out of seven progression criteria were classified as &#8216;partial target achieved&#8217;, indicating a medium likelihood of success in moving to a definitive trial.</p><p id="Par88">Unforeseen issues arose during the feasibility study that could not have been foreseen, and could not be corrected during the conduct of the study. Given the challenges faced&#8212;especially with randomisation, communication, and alignment of measurement tools&#8212;we recommend pausing before proceeding to a definitive trial. Future feasibility studies should focus on improving communication with schools, involving schools more in the design of studies and aim for co-production, recruitment and consent processes, and developing measurement tools that align closely with the intervention&#8217;s targeted behaviours. Addressing these issues will create a stronger foundation for eventual implementation and evaluation.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec27"><title>Appendix 1</title><p id="Par92">
