synthesis of InP quantum dots (QDs) suffers
from a significant drawback due to its low atomic efficiency, resulting
in the production of three equiv of phosphonium salts as a byproduct
for each equivalent of phosphorus atom incorporated into InP QDs.
To address this limitation, we propose a novel synthetic approach
for the fabrication of InP-QDs, utilizing Rieke-In (In*) as both an
indium precursor and a simultaneous reducing agent for the aminophosphanes
employed. This method not only enables a more efficient and sustainable
synthesis of InP-QDs but also offers excellent size tunability, as
demonstrated by the successful synthesis of green-emitting InP/GaP/ZnS-QDs.
The observed remarkable emission quantum yield (QY) exceeding 40%
and a narrow full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 50 nm further underscore
the merits of this new synthetic route. The combination of good QY
and precise size control makes this approach particularly intriguing
and promising for various optoelectronic applications.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><graphic position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="ic5c02060_0009.jpg"/></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc-graphic"><graphic id="tgr1" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="ic5c02060_0007.jpg"/></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="fnd-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry" vocab-identifier="10.13039/open_funder_registry">10.13039/501100001659</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WE 4621/3-2</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group id="fnd-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry" vocab-identifier="10.13039/open_funder_registry">10.13039/501100001659</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WE 4621/6-1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group id="fnd-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Technische Universit??t Dresden</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry" vocab-identifier="10.13039/open_funder_registry">10.13039/501100002957</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NA</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group id="fnd-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>S??chsische Aufbaubank</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry" vocab-identifier="10.13039/open_funder_registry">10.13039/501100006298</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100326379</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ic5c02060</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ic5c02060</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>production-flag-MathML-config-version</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>production-flag-journal-citation-display-style</meta-name><meta-value>acs-titles</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>production-flag-journal-date-display-style</meta-name><meta-value>dates-used-rcd-rvd-acc</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>production-flag-si-avail</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-alt-64</meta-name><meta-value>d1dfcae6c8858445ba7493bb871498c56d37ac2b378e0a6d2e5d075728f965e8</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have garnered

for optoelectronic devices and bioimaging application.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"/> Over the last two decades, significant progress
has been made in the synthesis of InP-QDs, especially with the use
of zinc salts to narrow particle size distribution. As a result, quantum
yields approaching unity and fluorescence band widths at half-maximum
(FWHM) below 40 nm have been achieved.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"/> Typically, P&#173;(Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>3</sub> serves as the most commonly

However, its high cost, hazardous nature, and pyrophoric properties,
along with specific handling requirements, have stimulated interest
in seeking alternative precursors. Various alternatives have been
proposed, including PH<sub>3</sub>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"/> P<sub>4</sub>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"/> (K/Na)<sub>3</sub>P,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"/> and aminophosphanes such as P&#173;(NMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> Among these alternatives, aminophosphanes
stand out as a promising candidate,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"/> owing
to their ease of handling, cost-effectiveness, and good stability.
Prominent examples include the work of Reiss et al., whose synthetic
approach is based on the use of Indium&#173;(I) halide, which acts as both
an indium source and a reducing agent for aminophosphine.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p><p>In our contribution to this area, we introduced
a long-time stable
stock solution of P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> (OLA = oleylamine) as P-precursor,
obviating the need for the previously employed in situ transamination
reaction with aminophosphane systems.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"/> The competitiveness of aminophosphanes in InP-QDs synthesis was
recently demonstrated with highly emitting QDs exhibiting a remarkable <italic toggle="yes">QY</italic> of 97% and FWHM of 37 nm.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"/> However, one significant drawback of this approach lies in the poor
atom efficiency, as the incorporation of phosphorus atoms in InP-QD
results in the production of three equiv of phosphonium salts as a
couple-product (e.g., [P&#173;(OLA)<sub>4</sub>] Cl; <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig">Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>). This stems from the necessary redox reaction
of the phosphorus atom, transforming from oxidation state +III in
the precursor to &#8722;III in the product.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

produced phosphonium salts may interfere with
the shelling procedures.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"/> Therefore, the
ideal reducing agent should possess properties that do not impede
core growth or shelling and be economical, easy to remove, and recoverable,
thereby significantly enhancing the application of aminophosphanes
in InP-QD production. While indium&#173;(I) halide salts have been a field
of study recently and show promising results,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"/> their price is several times that of indium&#173;(III) halide salts with
comparable purity. Meanwhile, elemental Indium has emerged as a fitting
solution and has been previously explored in combination with P&#173;(Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>3</sub> for the production of InP-QDs.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"/> The combination of elemental indium with P&#173;(Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>3</sub> did not deliver the desired results, as it
hinders the size tunability of InP-QDs due to direct phosphidation
of indium particles.</p><p>In this study, we introduce Indium nanoparticles
(referred to as
In*, Rieke-Indium) as a reducing agent for the reaction with aminophosphane
P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub>, which effectively circumvented this problem. An
additional advantage of our approach is the prevention of phosphonium
salt formation (<xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig">Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>), significantly improving the atom efficiency and waste management,
making it a more environmentally friendly synthesis of In-QDs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the remarkable size tunability of our system in the
formation of InP-QDs, with optical properties such as FWHM and QY
comparable to those reported for typical aminophosphane-based syntheses.
Moreover, we successfully extended our approach to the synthesis of
InP/GaP/ZnS QDs, further showcasing its versatility and potential
for future optoelectronic applications.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>In our pursuit of increasing the atom efficiency and reducing waste
generated during InP-QD synthesis via the aminophosphane route, we
explored the potential of Rieke-indium (In*) as a potential reducing
agent. Comparing the standard redox potential of In/In<sup>3+</sup> (<italic toggle="yes">E</italic> = &#8722;0.34 V vs NHE) with the half-wave
potential of the reduction of P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> (<italic toggle="yes">E</italic>

precursor in a 1:2 ratio. This would result in the reduction of one
&#8220;P<sup>3+</sup>&#8221; species to a &#8220;P<sup>3&#8211;</sup>&#8221;-equivalent for every two In<sup>3+</sup>-cations formed
(<xref rid="sch2" ref-type="fig">Scheme <xref rid="sch2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>). Notably,
a 1:2 ratio of P:In is also the optimal stoichiometry for syntheses
with P&#173;(Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>3</sub> to obtain QDs with particularly
low FWHM,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"/> a characteristic that we also
confirmed for our approach (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c02060/suppl_file/ic5c02060_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S2</ext-link>,
SI). Due to almost identical emission bandwidths of InP-based-QDs
using In:P ratios of 1:1 and 1:0.5 as well as the equilibrated redox
reaction in the latter case, higher In:P ratios were not investigated.</p><fig position="float" id="sch2" fig-type="scheme" orientation="portrait"><label>2</label><caption><title>Proposed Redox Reaction for the Synthesis of InP-QDs Using Rieke-Indium
(In*) as Reducing Agent</title></caption><graphic id="gr2" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="ic5c02060_0006.jpg"/></fig><p>While elemental indium has a low melting point of 156 &#176;C which
would, in principle, allow its direct use at a typical reaction temperature
of 200 &#176;C for nanoparticle synthesis, the high surface tensions
of metals prevent effective dispersion in the solvent. Thereby, the
possible contact area to the phosphorus precursor in solution is vastly
decreased compared to the one of nanoparticles, which limits the reaction
speed and increases size dispersion and lowers the quantity of the
obtained InP-QDs.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr"/> As precursors, alkylindium
derivatives were considered as a potential source of In particles.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"/> However, due to their challenging synthesis
and high cost, and considering our goal to find a more cost-effective
synthetic route (see <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c02060/suppl_file/ic5c02060_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Table S1</ext-link>, SI), we
decided against their use. Furthermore, during QD synthesis, alkylindium
derivatives tend to decompose, and the presence of surfactants such
as trioctylphosphane (TOP) in the transformation process may potentially
interfere with the subsequent QD growth. Therefore, we opted for an
alternative approach that avoids the use of alkylindium derivatives
and surfactants to ensure better control over the QD synthesis process.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

</p><p>Instead, easy-to-prepare In* was used as an In precursor for
InP-QD
synthesis in this work. The synthesis of In* was successfully achieved
by refluxing indium chloride with elemental potassium in xylene for
6 h under inert conditions (<xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig">Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>).<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr"/> As a byproduct of the
reaction, KCl is formed but does not interfere with subsequent reactions
and can be easily disposed of without posing any issues. Handling
the In*-dispersion proved to be safer and more manageable compared
to P&#173;(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> as the dispersion was found to
be nonpyrophoric. This characteristic makes it easier to work with
during the experimental procedures. Subsequently, after removal of
all volatiles, the formed In* was subjected to powder X-ray diffraction
(pXRD) characterization. The diffraction pattern displayed the absence
of typical reflexes for InCl<sub>3</sub> and K, indicating a complete
conversion of the reactants. The observed reflexes correspond only

to note that while the challenges associated with using potassium
as a reducing agent are acknowledged, the current focus of this paper
is on the successful application of Rieke Indium (In*) for the formation
of InP as a proof of principal, without specific emphasis on improving
the synthesis of Rieke Indium itself. Addressing the improvement of
the synthesis process of In* will be a subject of future research.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>1</label><caption><p>Powder

</xref>b reveals a heterogeneous
In* particle size distribution ranging from five nm to several hundred
nm, likely attributed to particle agglomeration due to the absence
of a surfactant shell.<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr"/> This is consistent
with previous characterizations of In*.<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr"/> Despite this apparent polydispersity, we propose that the leaching
or surface oxidation of In* gives rise to soluble In<sup>3+</sup> species
that serve as the actual precursor pool for InP QD formation. This
would explain the narrow size distribution observed in the final QDs,
despite the <italic toggle="yes">hetero</italic>g<italic toggle="yes">eneity of the In* source</italic>. While finer In* powders appeared to give slightly higher QD yields
in our hands, this observation remains qualitative and was not systematically
investigated.</p><p>Interestingly, we discovered that it was not necessary
to remove
the coprecipitated KCl for subsequent reaction. Consequently, we utilized
the as-produced In* without further purification, which was synthesized
over 6 h in boiling xylene, for the synthesis of InP-QDs. This discrepancy
between In* polydispersity and the observed size homogeneity in InP-QDs
suggests a leaching-driven mechanism in which soluble In<sup>3+</sup> species are formed in situ and serve as the reactive precursor pool.
In* acts in a dual role as both an In precursor and a reducing agent
in the heat-up synthesis conducted in octadecene (ODE). In this process,
we employed Zn&#173;(myristate)<sub>2</sub> as the zinc salt and P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> in the ODE as phosphorus precursor, unless otherwise specified
(synthetic procedure 1). It is intriguing to observe that the use
of In* as an Indium precursor in the synthetic procedure leads to
a significant improvement in the optical properties of the InP-QDs
compared to InCl<sub>3</sub>. Specifically, it results in a considerable
narrowing of the FWHM from 65 to 47 nm and a blue shift of the emission
from 591 to 488 nm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>a). The authors attribute the narrowing of the FWHM to a higher
reaction rate between In* and P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> compared to that
between InCl<sub>3</sub> and P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub>. This assumption is
supported by the observed blue shift which according to the LaMer
model for crystal growth is a result of faster precursor depletion.
It is known that the latter reaction rate is slower than optimal for
the formation of InP-QDs. Additionally, following the work up routine
used for InP-QDs syntheses on the In* stock solution and measuring
an ultraviolet&#8211;visible (UV/vis) spectrum of the supernatant,
no absorption was observed. This indicates that the work up procedure
assures that no residual In* affects the UV/vis spectra. Another method
employed for the synthesis of quantum dots is the hot-injection method
(synthetic procedure 2), in which the same amounts and reagents are
used as for the heat-up procedure. However, instead of adding the
precursors before the heating, P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> is introduced in
the hot indium precursor solution at a reaction temperature of 200
&#176;C. This approach enables more reliable monitoring of QD formation
using <sup>31</sup>P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
In typical InP-QD syntheses using indium salts and an aminophosphane,
the phosphonium salt [P&#173;(OLA)<sub>4</sub>]&#173;X is formed via disproportionation
of P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> (X = Cl, Br, I, OTf, myristate, OAc). However,
for synthesis procedure 2 in ODE, we observed that the phosphonium
salt [P&#173;(OLA)<sub>4</sub>]&#173;X is generated only as a minor byproduct
during the reaction, regardless of the reaction time as shown in <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c02060/suppl_file/ic5c02060_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S3</ext-link> for the case when Zn&#173;(myristate)<sub>2</sub> is used as zinc source. This indicates that the reported
reaction follows a distinct mechanism. Notably, when synthesis procedure
2 is carried out in oleylamine as solvent, there is an increased formation
of the byproduct [P&#173;(OLA)<sub>4</sub>]&#173;X, and the QD yield is lower.
This emphasizes the influence of solvent selection on the reaction
outcome. While a precise comparison is not possible, especially in
oleylamine-free synthesis, the amount of isolated InP-QDs compared
to the amount of phosphonium salt observed in <sup>31</sup>P NMR at
33.14 ppm indicates that the disproportionation reaction of P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> is a negligible side reaction (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c02060/suppl_file/ic5c02060_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S3</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>2</label><caption><p>(a) Comparison of UV/vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of

other. To investigate this further, we conducted a subsequent step
in which we washed freshly prepared In*, obtained after 6 h of reaction
time, three times with methanol (3x 25 mL) before proceeding with
the synthesis procedure 1. This step aimed to confirm that the reaction
was not influenced by any residual InCl<sub>3</sub>, as methanol is
known to dissolve InCl<sub>3</sub> and KCl. When InCl<sub>3</sub>-
and KCl-free In* was used for the heating reaction, the formation
of InP-QD was successful. However, we did observe a slight deterioration
in the optical properties, which may be attributed to the formation
of indium alcoholates during the washing process. Specifically, the
FWHM increased from 47 to 59 nm, while the emission wavelength remained
constant (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c02060/suppl_file/ic5c02060_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S4</ext-link>, SI). After successfully
obtaining InP-QDs with narrower emission bands by omitting the methanol
washing step, we continued using the in situ synthesized In* for our
reactions. We conducted experiments by reacting InCl<sub>3</sub> with
potassium over varying periods, up to nine h, to form In* and then
used different proportions of the in situ formed In* for InP-QD synthesis
according to procedure 1. Surprisingly, we observed no significant
change in the FWHM when using In* fractions that had been reacted
for more than 2 h. However, a slight red shift in the peak positions
of the luminescence bands was noticed over time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>b).</p><p>We further explored
the impact of reaction time by performing a
data point at 0 h of In* synthesis time. For this, the In* reaction
setup was executed as usual, but instead of heating the reaction mixture
of InCl<sub>3</sub>, potassium, and xylene to the refluxing temperature,
the mixture was stirred for 5 min at room temperature. Subsequently,
the mixture was utilized as the In*-dispersion in the synthesis of
InP-QDs. Remarkably, the InP-QDs prepared using the In* fraction synthesized
over 1 h did not exhibit fluorescence and were not successfully shelled.
Furthermore, after 9 h of In* synthesis time, precipitation of the
In* occurred. When a ZnS-shell was applied to these InP-QDs using
zinc diethyldithiocarbamate as a single-source precursor (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c02060/suppl_file/ic5c02060_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S5</ext-link>, SI), we observed that the same trends
in FWHM and peak position were maintained for the InP/ZnS core/shell
system, reaffirming the consistency of our approach. We also investigated
the optimal synthesis time for In* to achieve the best InP-QD properties.
The UV/vis spectra of InP-QDs prepared with In* synthesized for up
to 8 h are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>c. We found that the optimal properties of InP-QDs were obtained
in reactions using In* synthesized over 6 h. This reaction time avoids
the influence of residual InCl<sub>3</sub> impurities and the agglomeration
and precipitation of indium particles that occurs when In* is synthesized
for more than 8 h.</p><p>To understand the kinetics of InP-QD core
growth, we performed
time-resolved measurements by measuring a reaction aliquot every 5
min after injection of P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> into the In*-containing
reaction mixture for a total of 30 min of InP-QD core growth. We observed
no shift in absorption characteristics during core growth, indicating
that no particle growth occurred. This suggests rapid depletion of
precursors, similar to observations with In salts and (Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>3</sub>P as reagents.<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr"/> Interestingly,
we found that the amount of InP-QDs produced is inversely proportional
to the size of the In* particle at the start of the reaction. Initial
experiments with macroscopic indium chips yielded little material,
but its optical properties were identical with those synthesized from
smaller In* particles. Therefore, obtaining smaller In* particles
is crucial to maximize the reaction yield. Contrary to our expectations,
increasing the equivalents of P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> used did not increase
the amount of InP-QDs obtained. This underscores that the typical
disproportionation reaction of the P-precursor is not responsible
for the InP-QD formation. On the contrary, large amounts of P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> in the reaction had detrimental effects on QD properties,
as evidenced by comparing UV/vis spectra and FWHM values of the emission
band of InP-QDs obtained with different amounts of P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c02060/suppl_file/ic5c02060_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S2</ext-link>). A significant increase in
FWHM, accompanied by a blue shift, was observed with increasing amounts
of utilized P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub>. The FWHM of unshelled InP-QDs gradually
increased from 47 nm for 0.5 eq. of P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> to over 100
nm when 4 eq. of P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> were used, indicating the importance
of controlling the amount of P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> for obtaining desired
optical properties and cost-effectiveness. A blue shift in the emission
wavelength was observed from 488 to 455 nm when using 0.5 and 4 equiv
of P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub>, respectively. The same trends were observed
for the ZnS-shelled QDs. As a similar blue shift has been reported
for the reaction between In-salts and progressively larger amounts
of aminophosphanes,<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr"/> our observations
are attributed to a higher nucleation rate, limiting the subsequent
QD growth and resulting in smaller-sized QDs and a higher FWHM due
to Ostwald ripening.<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p><p>Regarding
the formation mechanism of InP-QDs via our approach,
two factors suggest a leaching/dissolution pathway rather than a direct
conversion of In* particles via phosphidation. First, in the reaction
of elemental In-NCs with P&#173;(Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>3</sub>, a direct
conversion of homogeneously size-distributed In-NCs to InP-QDs was
observed along with a size increase of 15&#8211;20%.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"/> However, in our approach, due to the broad size-distribution
of In* as seen in TEM images, a different reaction mechanism must
take place. If the phosphidation pathway had occurred in the described
reaction, then we would have obtained an extremely broad size distribution
for InP-QDs. However, this is not observed in either TEM images or
UV/vis spectra. Second, the InP-QD ensembles obtained by our group
exhibit tunable emission maxima and a narrow FWHM. The correlation
between particle size and optical properties through the quantum confinement
effect leads to wavelength shifts in the absorption and emission spectra,
which cannot be explained by the phosphidation of broadly size-distributed
In*.</p><p>To explore the size tunability of InP-QDs, we used various
zinc
salts (ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, ZnBr<sub>2</sub>, ZnI<sub>2</sub>, Zn&#173;(OTf)<sub>2</sub>, Zn&#173;(myristate)<sub>2</sub>, and Zn&#173;(OAc)<sub>2</sub>) separately
in hot injection reactions (synthesis procedure 2) to obtain UV/vis
spectra of InP-QDs with differently shifted excitonic features. Similar
to the synthesis using indium salts,<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr"/> we
observed blue-shifted UV/vis excitonic features and thus, size tunability
when using zinc salts with heavier halide anions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>e). The presence of different
zinc salts, including halides, governs the particle size of InP-QDs
during the synthesis of In-salts with aminophosphanes. This is attributed
to the role of halide ions or other organic surfactants in quantum
dot surface chemistry and the reactivity of phosphorus precursors.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8722;<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr" specific-use="suppress-in-print"/>
<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> Using ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, we obtained InP and InP/ZnS-QDs with an
emission maximum of 553 and 558 nm respectively, demonstrating the
applicability of the approach also for the synthesis of QDs with longer
wavelengths (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c02060/suppl_file/ic5c02060_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S6</ext-link>, SI). Size tunability
was also observed when using Zn&#173;(OAc)<sub>2</sub>, Zn&#173;(myristate)<sub>2</sub>, and Zn&#173;(OTf)<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>f). Consequently, the dissolution and leaching
of In-atoms or In<sup>3+</sup>-ions from In* must be a preliminary
step in our InP-QD synthesis to obtain In-monomers necessary for nucleation
and subsequent particle growth. Otherwise, no differing particle sizes
would be observed. Notably, the InP-QDs with the narrowest emission
band were obtained when using 2 equiv of Zn&#173;(myristate)<sub>2</sub> in the synthesis, achieving an impressive FWHM as low as 44 nm at
an emission wavelength of 486 nm prior to shelling in the heat-up
reaction. However, despite our efforts, we were unable to precipitate
the unshelled InP-QDs from the oil we obtained after workup, which
consequently prevented the acquisition of a pXRD pattern. Nevertheless,
our synthesis with subsequent shelling produced InP/ZnS-QDs with a
FWHM of 51 nm at 520 nm emission wavelength and an emission quantum
yield QY &lt; 10% (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c02060/suppl_file/ic5c02060_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S7</ext-link>, SI).</p><p>To further improve the quantum yield, InP-QDs were shelled with
an GaP/ZnS multishell, following the recently reported synthesis of
InP/GaP/ZnS-QDs via the aminophosphane route.<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr"/> In contrast to the multistep process required for obtaining InP/GaP-QDs
in that study, we adopted a simple one-pot procedure to directly obtain
InP/GaP-QDs, which were subsequently coated with a ZnS shell. When
precipitation of InP/GaP and InP/GaP/ZnS-QDs was required, e. g.,
for TEM and pXRD measurements, the reaction was conducted in hexadecane
(synthesis procedure 1a), while octadecane was used otherwise (synthesis
procedure 1). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>a shows the UV/vis spectra of the synthesized InP/GaP-QDs, where
rapid depletion of the precursors is again observed, indicating efficient
QD formation. Furthermore, the excitonic feature is found to be narrower
than that of InP-QDs, indicating improved optical properties for potential
applications. The pXRD patterns indicate minor incorporation of Ga
or the formation of a thin GaP-shell in InP/GaP/ZnS-QDs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>b). TEM images display
particles with an average size of 4.9 &#177; 1.2 nm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>c and <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c02060/suppl_file/ic5c02060_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">S8</ext-link>). The pXRD reflexes exhibit a strong shift due to the applied
ZnS shell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>b<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>,c). Further characterization using HAADF-STEM
with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) analysis on the fully
shelled InP/GaP/ZnS-QDs revealed the formation of two different particle
species. The first species lacked a ZnS-shell and mainly consisted
of In, P, and Ga. The second species featured a small InP core with
a thick ZnS-shell, and no incorporation of potassium from the In*
stock solution was observed in either species. These findings strongly
suggest the presence of two distinct populations rather than a uniform
core&#8211;shell architecture. This aligns with the results of XRD
and EDXS analyses, which point to a statistical mixture of InP-rich
and GaP-containing particles. Accordingly, the observed emission characteristics
arise from an ensemble of structurally distinct particles rather than
a single, well-defined InP/GaP/ZnS core&#8211;shell architecture.
While this may limit their immediate applicability in optoelectronics,
the approach provides a scalable route toward high-quality emissive
materials with promising properties. While this diverges from the
idealized core&#8211;shell scenario, the resulting ensemble nonetheless
exhibits favorable photophysical properties and demonstrates the potential
of this synthetic strategy for accessing high-performance, heterostructure-like
QDs by simple and scalable means. Optical characterization showed
no fluorescence of InP or GaP before shelling. However, shelling with
ZnS significantly increased the QY to 46% with a FWHM of 50 nm at
an emission wavelength of 510 nm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>a), indicating that particles with a thick
ZnS-shell contributed to the optical properties of the QD ensemble.
This ZnS-shelling induced red shift is consistent with prior literature
reports and attributed to a less-confined exciton.<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr"/> Repeatability of the synthesis is depicted in the UV/vis
and PL spectra of three different experiments (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c02060/suppl_file/ic5c02060_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S9</ext-link>). Comparing the results with the more commonly used
InP/ZnSeS/ZnS-core/shell/shell system, we observed a QY of 42% and
a FWHM of 62 nm at an emission wavelength of 523 nm (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c02060/suppl_file/ic5c02060_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S10</ext-link>) using a modified literature procedure.<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr"/>

slight optimizations of the synthesis procedures,
the observed FWHM for InP/GaP/ZnS-QDs is among the narrowest reported
in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the FWHM for unprotected
InP-QDs by synthesis with aminophosphanes belongs to the narrowest
to date. This highlights the competitiveness of our newly developed
method, even if the resulting product is a mixture of particle types
rather than a single well-defined core/shell architecture and is not
yet suited for optoelectronic applications. Here, control over the
heterostructure synthesis must be improved. Both InP/GaP/ZnS and InP/ZnSeS/ZnS
systems provide a strong foundation for further optimization, making
them attractive and sustainable routes for InP-based QD synthesis,
and this is the topic for ongoing investigations.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we have successfully demonstrated the use of Rieke-indium
(In*) as an efficient indium precursor and reducing agent for the
synthesis of InP quantum dots (QDs) using aminophosphanes. By employing
In*, we significantly reduced the required amount of aminophosphane,
avoiding the usual disproportionation reaction of the phosphorus precursor.
This led to minimized formation of phosphonium salt byproducts, thus
enabling a more atom-efficient and environmentally benign synthetic
route. To support this approach, we developed a novel oleylamine-free
0.4 M P&#173;(OLA)<sub>3</sub> stock solution in ODE, which proved compatible
with our In* precursor. Our data highlight the excellent size tunability
achievable with this system, as illustrated by using different zinc
salts and tailoring P:In ratios. Notably, we synthesized green-emitting
InP/GaP/ZnS QDs with a nonoptimized quantum yield (QY) of 46%, a narrow
full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 50 nm, and an emission maximum
at 510 nm. Detailed structural analysis revealed the formation of
a statistical mixture of InP- and GaP-rich particles rather than a
distinct core&#8211;shell configuration. Despite this, the optical
quality of the resulting QDs remains highly competitive.</p><p>Looking
ahead, we believe that the current method, similar to P&#173;(Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>3</sub>-based approaches, can be further optimized
to reduce the FWHM, improve emission wavelength control, and enhance
quantum yields. By refining shelling procedures and improving particle
homogeneity, we anticipate broader applicability of this In*-based
strategy for the sustainable production of high-quality InP-based
nanomaterials.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>InCl<sub>3</sub> (99,99%, anhydrous), GaCl<sub>3</sub> (99,999%,

not possible to obtain reliable data for the pure InP-core QDs. In
the case of the InP/GaP/ZnS QDs with heterogeneous composition, the
