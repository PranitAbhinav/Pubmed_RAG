However, to better understand how games affect the mental health of young people, their use and experiences must be situated in the sociocultural and personal life contexts of individuals. Drawing from a cultural-ecosocial approach, this study combines cross-sectional and digital phenotyping measures to examine the effects of video games on the mental health of youth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Participants will be young people aged 16&#8211;25 years from the community and living in the province of Quebec, Canada. An initial sample of 1000 youth will complete a cross-sectional survey online, including measures of socio-demographic context, gaming practices and experiences, streaming practices and experiences, as well as personality and well-being. Qualitative questions will explore personal views on games and mental health. A subsample of 100 participants will be selected for digital phenotyping, including daily surveys of well-being, gaming, streaming and social experiences, combined with passive mobile sensing (eg, geolocation). Analyses will include regression and mixed models for quantitative data, reflexive thematic analysis for qualitative data, and an integration of quantitative and qualitative results using participatory methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board of McGill University (24-02-015). The dissemination of results will be conducted in partnership with a multi-stakeholder advisory committee, including youth who play video games, and will involve peer-reviewed publications, presentations to policymakers in Quebec, and workshops for clinicians and researchers.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Digital Technology</kwd><kwd>MENTAL HEALTH</kwd><kwd>Behavior</kwd><kwd>Social Interaction</kwd><kwd>Social Support</kwd><kwd>Internet</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008240</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Qu&#233;bec-Soci&#233;t&#233; et Culture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2024-0UEA-339286</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>The inclusion of structural factors, social affiliation through play and streaming-related experiences addresses gaps in the literature regarding the sociocultural influences of games on mental health.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Digital phenotyping will allow for the robust examination of within-person dynamics that are independent from the confounding influences of unmeasured individual traits.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The combination of quantitative and qualitative data will provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of games and mental health.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Convenience sampling in a specific region (the Quebec province in Canada) limits the generalisability of the results.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Given the heterogeneity of game genres and social contexts surrounding game experiences, the study measures can only partially capture their diverse ramifications for mental health.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p> Video games are highly popular among youth aged 16&#8211;25 years old.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 2</sup></xref> In the province of Quebec, Canada, the Entertainment Software Association of Canada reports that 71% of young adults own a video game console, and 41% of Quebecers (10% more than other Canadians) play games regularly.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> In Canada, the average video gaming time is 6.5&#8201;hours/week among female young adults and 10.2&#8201;hours/week among male young adults, in line with global trends.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4 5</sup></xref> Some 82% of male and 58% of female players declare themselves to be &#8216;gamers&#8217;.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> For the 74% of Canadians who grew up playing video games, 74% are passing on the hobby, playing video games with their children as a way of spending time together.</p><p>Although video gaming has become a multigenerational activity, there is a long history of concerns about its potential negative impacts on the well-being of young people. Early studies have suggested that violent games increase the aggressivity of young players,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> or that excessive screen time might be at the expense of sleep, school, work, physical activity or interpersonal activities necessary for maintaining a person&#8217;s overall functioning and well-being.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8 9</sup></xref> Screen time refers to the amount of time spent on electronic devices, such as video games, and is commonly perceived as a behaviour that can negatively influence physical and mental well-being.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> These putative effects of video games and screen time have become controversial owing to methodological and conceptual issues (a review of which is beyond the scope of this protocol), but they continue to animate scientific and popular discourses on video games.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p>Another concern about games is that they may become the source of addictive behaviours. The International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision, recognised this addictive potential under the label of gaming disorder, defined as &#8216;impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities (&#8230;), and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences&#8217;.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Critical perspectives on gaming disorder have highlighted the challenge of differentiating high engagement in video games that is not pathological from &#8216;truly&#8217; addictive forms of gaming.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13 14</sup></xref> Clinical research seeks to advance the detection and treatment of gaming disorder with the hope of improving youth mental health,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and in this context, it has been suggested that high engagement in games might trigger or amplify psychotic symptoms in some individuals.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> However, developmental research into gaming and psychotic-like experiences suggests that the two may be linked through shared risk factors, such as challenging life circumstances, rather than a causal effect of gaming on psychosis.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17 18</sup></xref></p><p>While concerns about problematic gaming have dominated clinical discourse, there is evidence for positive effects of video gaming, which may help explain why some people turn to video games to deal with challenging situations. Observational research using in-the-moment (ie, ambulatory) assessments and natural experiments has shown that people&#8217;s mood improves when they play video games,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19 20</sup></xref> suggesting a role for video gaming as an emotion regulation strategy. The experience of immersing oneself in games may contribute to providing a relief from day-to-day stressors while providing an alternative environment to fulfil psychological needs (eg, of social connection).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Surveys, laboratory experiments, qualitative interviews and ethnographic research support the importance of social connectedness enabled by video games for well-being.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Moreover, games afford opportunities to embody virtual characters with desirable traits or elevated social status, conferring opportunities for young people to explore and adaptively experiment with their identity.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22 26</sup></xref> Finally, some video games solicit cognitive functions in ways that may enhance processing, memory and multitasking skills over time.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p><p>Beyond the immediate context of game play, shared interest in games serves as a scaffolding for communities of gamers who meet and socialise in a variety of spaces. Fan communities of video games may enrich the social capital of young players by offering opportunities to establish new relationships and make a living from streaming activities;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> however, they may also be places of exclusion, harassment and discrimination that hamper the well-being of their members.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Streaming platforms such as Twitch are key spaces where people interact over a common interest in a game, a game performance and/or a content creator (the streamer).<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> The culture of esports (competitive and/or professional game play) and streaming expands the range of experiences enabled by video games: through these game-related productions and events, people interested in video games can interact with like-minded peers (eg, by contributing to group discussions in streaming channels) and engage with the narratives and mechanics of play without being the player. Although the popularity of video game streaming has significantly increased over the last decade, the role of this phenomenon in the mental health of young gamers remains underexplored in research.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p>The range of putative benefits and harms of video games for mental health is not surprising when we consider the diversity of games, the psychological features and personal histories of players, and the sociocultural contexts in which gamers and games are embedded.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31 32</sup></xref> We posit that a cultural-ecosocial approach to mental health<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> provides a helpful framework for examining the multifaceted connections between games and mental health. According to the cultural-ecosocial view, environmental influences on mental health can be disaggregated into at least four domains: (1) Lifespan developmental history, (2) Social structure and positioning, (3) Cultural meaning, norms, values and affordances and (4) Individual biography and self-understanding. This approach builds on previous biopsychosocial accounts of mental health by specifying the mechanisms that connect environment, culture and mental health<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> and has been proposed as a framework for advancing neuroscience and precision psychiatry research.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35 36</sup></xref></p><p><italic toggle="yes">Lifespan developmental history</italic>. Lifespan development encompasses the psychological needs, social roles and unique psychological traits of individuals that shape the impacts of games on mental health. Granic<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> argued that for adolescents and young adults, games offer rich opportunities to develop their identities, practise prosocial behaviours and form intimate bonds with their peers, which are central to this period of life. Self-determination theory advances that gaming can be motivated by the fulfilment of psychological needs for autonomy, competence and connectedness,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> and empirical evidence suggests a positive effect on the well-being of players who successively satisfy these needs through video games.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> However, excessive video gaming (ie, gaming disorder) may interfere with role fulfilment, including relationships with peers and family, as well as school functioning, for some individuals.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Digital phenotyping, which involves ambulatory collection of active (eg, surveys) and passive (eg, geolocation) data, may provide indirect markers of gaming disorder;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> notably, greater time spent at home according to geolocation has been associated with depressive symptoms<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> and could hypothetically index reduced mobility as a consequence of prolonged gaming sessions. Importantly, the practices and outcomes of video games vary in part as a function of the psychological propensities of players. For example, there is some evidence that the experience of being immersed in a video game (ie, the degree to which the person feels absorbed in the game<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref>) is associated with improvements in emotional states,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> but immersion has also been hypothesised to contribute to the risk of gaming disorder.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> A better understanding of how individuals fulfil their developmental needs and self-determination through games, and how they differ in their propensity to experience immersion, could support a more personalised assessment of the risks and benefits of games.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Social structure and positioning</italic>. Social structures and the positioning of individuals can influence how and why they engage with games. In the face of social exclusion or challenging life circumstances, some people will turn to video games as a means of immersing themselves into a more welcoming environment and for making friends online.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21 24 44</sup></xref> For individuals living in socioeconomic precarity, games may be a safer and more accessible activity relative to other pursuits, which could explain why lower household income or parental socioeconomic status are associated with higher levels of adolescent video gaming in some samples.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18 45</sup></xref> Disability may increase the salience of gaming as an activity that is relatively more accessible than others to fulfil psychological needs for self-determination;<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46 47</sup></xref> however, disability may also limit the accessibility of games that solicit particular physical or cognitive resources. Women, queer and racialised gamers are at increased risk of exposure to harassment and discrimination in game communities and online multiplayer games.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48 49</sup></xref> These examples illustrate how social structures and positioning can predispose to or interfere with a range of game-related experiences.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Cultural meaning, norms, values and affordances</italic>. The shared norms and values of a person&#8217;s social network may encourage or discourage certain ways of engaging with games. For one, being part of a group of friends who share one&#8217;s interest in games lends a particular meaning to games as something that fosters and nourishes friendships. Playing games jointly with friends or family affords an opportunity for social connection that contributes to individual well-being.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> In the absence of such social ties, there may be fewer opportunities to integrate in-game accomplishments and experiences outside of the game environment&#8212;and possibly increased risk of facing the disapproval of others for what is often deemed to be excessive &#8216;screen time&#8217;.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref> Although the role of these cultural factors in the mental health effects of games remains underexplored, we can posit benefits (eg, social connectedness) and risks (eg, stigma and isolation) related therefrom. Positive and negative effects of games may thus be uncovered in research by considering the alignment or mismatch of gaming behaviours with norms and values in the person&#8217;s social environment.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Individual biography and self-understanding</italic>. Unique aspects of gaming experiences might influence the self-concept and well-being of individuals in ways that are not fully captured by existing theoretical frameworks. Focusing solely on theorised mechanisms of effects on mental health, such as gaming disorder or psychological need satisfaction, risks overlooking the unique ways in which games can bring pivotal life experiences for individuals.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26 52</sup></xref> For this reason, exploring the lived experiences of young players in an open-ended fashion, for example, through qualitative and participatory methods, is essential for producing a comprehensive understanding of gaming and mental health.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>The present study</title><p>Research published to date has largely relied on cross-sectional samples, limiting the capacity to remove confounding influences from individual characteristics of participants. In addition, existing research infrequently accounts for streaming practices and the role of social factors in the associations between video games and mental health. As highlighted above, video games may have different impacts on mood and well-being depending on the person&#8217;s social context, the psychological mechanisms that are activated and the overall characteristics of video game habits and streaming activities. Given the potential influences of social context on these associations, it is necessary to consider features such as socio-economic status, gender, ethnoracial identity, (dis)ability, as well as game-related practices that are shared with friends or family.</p><p>This study will thus aim to investigate the associations of video game-related experiences with mental health in youth aged 16&#8211;25 years old from the general population of the province of Quebec, Canada. The study will have two components: a cross-sectional survey of 1000 individuals recruited by convenience in the community and including a mix of quantitative and qualitative items, followed by digital phenotyping (ie, daily diaries and mobile sensing) in a subsample of 100 individuals over 2 weeks. The key objectives of the study, listed in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, focus on psychological needs, immersion, game-related social affiliation, harassment and discrimination, and self-narratives about games and mental health. A distinctive feature here is the inclusion of psychotic-like experiences, which are rarely investigated in the field of games and media effects but are considered a transdiagnostic marker of risk for mental health problems during adolescence and early adulthood.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref> Additional objectives will be to examine the associations of streaming-related experiences with well-being, and to explore the predictive utility of mobile sensing data (eg, geolocation).

For the cross-sectional questionnaire, we will recruit 1000 adolescent and adult gamers from the general population in the province of Quebec, Canada. Eligibility criteria will include: (1) Age 16&#8211;25 years, (2) Playing video games at least 1&#8201;hour per week and (3) Speaking English or French. Of this sample, 100 participants will be selected to participate in the digital phenotyping component; these participants will be randomly selected after stratification according to their gender (to ensure at least 30% of cisgender boys or men, at least 30% of cisgender girls or women and at least 10% of transgender or non-binary individuals). Digital phenotyping will include daily surveys (sometimes referred to as ecological momentary assessment or experience sampling<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref>) and mobile sensing. The daily surveys and mobile sensing data will be collected for 2 weeks using the Beiwe application installed on participants&#8217; smartphones.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Rationale for the sample size</title><p>Given the variety of objectives and analyses planned, we established the sample size based on two basic scenarios: a linear regression of one cross-sectional variable over another (n=1000) and a generalised linear mixed model where one daily digital phenotyping variable is regressed over another (n=100). For the cross-sectional scenario, we conducted the power analyses in G*Power, V.3.1.9.7. We calculated that a sample of n=1000&#8201;will be sufficient to detect a linear regression slope of &#946;=0.09, assuming a type I error rate of 0.05 (two-tailed) and statistical power of 85%. This would be sufficient to evaluate, for example, a weak but significant association between greater belonging and lower levels of psychotic-like experiences (Objective 1) or a greater propensity for immersion and greater psychological functions of games (Objective 2). For the digital phenotyping component, we used the sample size calculator developed by Barnett and colleagues:<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56</sup></xref>
<ext-link xlink:href="https://onnela-lab.shinyapps.io/digital_phenotyping_sample_size_calculator/" ext-link-type="uri">https://onnela-lab.shinyapps.io/digital_phenotyping_sample_size_calculator/</ext-link>. We found that a sample size of 100 persons with daily measures over 2 weeks will provide statistical power of 93% to detect effect sizes of &#946;=0.07 with a type I error rate of 0.05, assuming 50% missing data and random-effect variance of 1.1. These parameters would be sufficient to examine the association between daily needs satisfaction in games and daily well-being (Objective 1) or the association between daily immersion and daily well-being (Objective 2). This statistical power estimation also applies to passive sensor data (eg, geolocation) transformed into daily features (eg, daily time spent at home).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Procedures for recruitment, data collection and retention</title><p>Recruitment for the cross-sectional study started on 15 September 2024 and is ongoing. Participants are recruited through advertisements on social media targeting the age range and geographic region of interest. To maximise sample diversity, we have contacted several community organisations with missions related to mental health, LGBTQ+communities, and the well-being of immigrant and racialised youths, as well as university student groups and online communities with game-adjacent interests (eg, roleplay games, cosplay, geek) across the province of Quebec who circulated the advertisement through their networks. Recruitment will stop after achieving the targeted sample size. After being directed to a website presenting the study, individuals will be screened for eligibility and will provide virtual consent to participate in the cross-sectional questionnaire via electronic signature. Participants will then complete the cross-sectional questionnaire on REDCap, after which they will be invited to complete additional measures (cognitive tasks) on PsychoJS, which will be described in a future publication. Participants who provide optional consent to complete the cognitive tasks on PsychoJS will receive a link by email at a later time.</p><p>As part of the cross-sectional questionnaire, participants will be asked if they agree to be contacted for the digital phenotyping component. Participants of the digital phenotyping component will be randomly selected by email or phone from the list of responders who expressed their interest and will be invited to a 30&#8201;min virtual individual meeting with a research assistant. During the meeting, the research assistant will present the study protocol and consent form for the digital phenotyping. Consent will be provided by electronic signature. Then, participants will receive assistance to install the Beiwe application on their smartphone.</p><p>To compensate participants for their time, they will be offered $35 in gift cards for participating in the cross-sectional survey. Participants in the digital phenotyping will receive $5 for each daily questionnaire completed (ie, a total of $70 if all questionnaires are completed). Throughout the follow-up period for digital phenotyping, a research assistant will be available to provide technical support as needed. An email will be sent to participants when they reach the fourth day of data collection to inquire about any difficulties.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Beiwe application</title><p>Throughout the follow-up period, Beiwe will be used to collect passive digital data and to administer self-report questionnaires to participants of the digital phenotyping. This application is compatible with iOS and Android smartphones and automatically uploads the data it collects to secure cloud servers. Beiwe was developed by the Onnela Lab (Harvard University) and implemented in Montreal by Lanovaz and colleagues (Centre Axel). It can be downloaded from the Centre Axel website (<ext-link xlink:href="https://beiwe.centreaxel2.com/download" ext-link-type="uri">https://beiwe.centreaxel2.com/download</ext-link>) for Android phones and from the App Store for iOS phones.

The app will passively collect data on geolocation, accelerometry and screen activation time. Data from Beiwe will be encrypted and stored on secure servers in Quebec. Every day for 2 weeks, participants will also receive a prompt to complete a questionnaire on the application. Previous studies<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39 57</sup></xref> support the association of these digital markers with common mental health symptoms in population-based samples, when combined with self-report questionnaires, and will be explored here as correlates of game-related experiences and well-being.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cross-sectional measures</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Eligibility screening</italic>.

These frameworks ensure that the project activities and outcomes will ultimately achieve meaningful benefits for Quebec youth, for the adults close to them (eg, parents, educators, social/health providers), and for social and health services in the province. We established a multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder Advisory Committee (AC) at the outset to provide oversight at all stages of the project. The AC includes members from the provincial Quebec health ministry, social and health services, the video game industry and youth of the Gaming Against Stigma Advisory Group (Youth Advisory). The Youth Advisory includes gamers aged between 18 and 35 years old, some with lived experience of mental illness.</p><p>The Youth Advisory and the Ludic Mind Studio research team meet every month to discuss their research activities and knowledge translation projects. The Youth Advisory was involved from the beginning of the present study (study design and application for funding) in April 2023. The rest of the AC was formed after obtaining funding in September 2023. Since then, we have been holding joint meetings with the AC approximately every 6 months, in addition to monthly meetings with the Youth Advisory. The AC and Youth Advisory contributed to the present study&#8217;s research questions by advocating for the inclusion of streaming-related measures based on their personal experiences of streaming as an important part of game culture. The AC also supported the foregrounding of social factors as part of the theoretical framework and research questions of the study, notably to acknowledge the role of games for coping with challenging life circumstances. The selection of measures was made by the research team based on these considerations and was presented to the AC, who approved it. The Youth Advisory supported recruitment by disseminating the study invitation in their networks. Members of the Youth Advisory tested the cross-sectional survey to confirm that the time for completion of the survey was acceptable, and some changes were made based on their feedback (eg, relabeling a &#8216;Clinical factors&#8217; category, which includes psychotic-like experiences, as &#8216;Psychological factors&#8217; instead).

We will analyse cross-sectional outcomes using generalised linear models adjusted for relevant socio-demographic characteristics (eg, sex, educational attainment and occupational status). In these models, missing data will be handled by complete case analysis or multiple imputation. We will analyse longitudinal outcomes (eg, daily well-being) using generalised linear mixed models with observations nested in individuals. Missing data will be handled by maximum likelihood. To parse out within-person and between-person associations between longitudinal repeated measures (eg, the association between daily psychological need satisfaction and daily well-being), we will apply person-centring and mean-centring to the predictors; this approach accounts for time-invariant, unmeasured individual factors that could confound associations between the predictor and outcome.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref> Mobile sensing data will be transformed into higher-level, validated features over epochs of 1&#8201;day for integration into generalised linear mixed models as exploratory predictors of game-related experiences and well-being; for example, geolocation data will be used to infer the daily amount of time spent at home.</p><p>Of note, because the digital phenotyping component will only start after completion of the cross-sectional sample, we anticipate that for some participants, the interval between the two data collections may be up to about 12 months. We will consider the impact of this delay on the interpretation of the eventual study findings. For example, the delay could attenuate the strength of the association between modified Fandom Functions Scale&#8212;Belonging (cross-sectional) and daily well-being (digital phenotyping) in Objective 1, given that the experience of belonging in game communities may change with time.</p><p>We will use reflexive thematic analysis for qualitative data.<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr"><sup>87</sup></xref> This approach aims to uncover shared patterns of meaning across participants&#8217; responses through a reflexive, recursive process. The steps of reflexive thematic analysis include: (1) Familiarisation with the data, (2) Generating initial codes, (3) Searching for themes, (4) Reviewing potential themes and (5) Defining and naming the themes.<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr"><sup>88</sup></xref> Our analysis of the qualitative data will be primarily inductive to better understand the lived experiences of gamers. Finally, in collaboration with the AC, the quantitative and qualitative results will be integrated within a critical realist framework to support or revise the theoretical interpretations.<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr"><sup>89</sup></xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s5-1"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study will be conducted according to ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and received ethical approval on 20 June 2024, from the Institutional Review Board of McGill University (reference number: 24-02-015). Consent forms will take into consideration the well-being, free will and respect of participants, including respect for privacy. For participants younger than age 18, caregiver consent is not always required in Canada. Here, for participants aged 16&#8211;18, we will not require consent from caregivers, based on the consideration that the risks of participation in the study are minimal, and that participants will be invited to provide data, which they may wish to keep private from their caregivers&#8212;such as information on gender identity, cannabis use, gaming habits and social relationships with peers.</p></sec><sec id="s5-2"><title>Safety considerations</title><p>Apps commonly used by adolescents and adults frequently collect and upload their geolocation data to the internet, often without users&#8217; full awareness.<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr"><sup>90</sup></xref> For the current research, we are emphasising this aspect of the digital phenotyping component in the consent form to ensure participants&#8217; full awareness and consent of the procedure. Data will be stored on secure servers located in Montreal, Canada, that are fully compliant with Quebec regulations on data privacy. Identifying information (name, email address, postal code) will be stored in a separate file linked to the rest of the data via an identification number. To protect the privacy of participants, geolocation data will be converted into non-identifying features: time spent at home (inferred based on the location most visited by the participant during the study period) and the amount of movement. Raw geolocation data will be deleted within 6&#8201;months of completion of data collection. Access to the processed, de-identified data will be limited to the research team, including students and collaborators. Data will be kept for 10 years before being deleted.</p><p>We also acknowledge that some questions may trigger discomfort or distress in participants. Participants will be informed that they can contact the research team at any point to receive assistance as needed, including immediate support and orientation to appropriate psychological or social services in the community.</p></sec><sec id="s5-3"><title>Dissemination plan</title><p>Results of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and will be shared with gamers and people with lived experience of mental illness, in collaboration with the study&#8217;s Youth Advisory. The findings will inform the design of subsequent stages of the Game-in-Action project, which will include interventional research and will be described elsewhere. The results will also be presented to policymakers in the province of Quebec, Canada, via meetings organised by the Fonds de recherche du Quebec (the study sponsor) to inform policies regarding screen use among youth. Finally, the results will be presented to researchers and clinicians via workshops and talks in academic conferences, clinical rounds and other institutional events. While the present study aims to recruit participants from diverse backgrounds, it is likely that convenience sampling across groups will not be sufficient to uncover all potential group-based differences. A future direction for research will thus be to incorporate more targeted sampling strategies to better capture differences in gaming experiences related to sociocultural and personal circumstances, such as ethnoracial groups, LGBTQ+identities, mental health and disabilities.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2025-103685</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-9-s001.docx" id="d67e812" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was supported by the Fonds de Recherche du Qu&#233;bec - Soci&#233;t&#233; et culture (FRQSC) awared to MF, grant number 2024-0UEA-339286.
