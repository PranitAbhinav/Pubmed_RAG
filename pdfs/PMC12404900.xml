The programme's evolution has been marked by increasing patient leadership and is now co&#8208;chaired by a patient partner and a healthcare professional, with patients involved at all levels (design, delivery, assessment and improvement).</p></sec><sec id="tct70199-sec-0003"><title>Evaluation</title><p>Key developments in patients' relationships with other stakeholders involved in the PARTENAIRES programme are highlighted. With students, patients have transitioned from providing one&#8208;off, idealised testimonials to sustaining reflexive, real conversations that bridge the student&#8208;patient gap. With academic disciplines, patient partners that were initially paired based on matching with their lived experience are now paired more flexibly to foster a universal educational contribution and support interdisciplinary learning. With clinical co&#8208;facilitators, the patients' role has evolved from reactive participation during workshops to proactive co&#8208;construction, promoting the democratisation of exchanges and shared responsibility for the programme's educational content.</p></sec><sec id="tct70199-sec-0004"><title>Implications</title><p>Sustained institutional trust and long&#8208;term involvement have enabled patient partners to become central co&#8208;creators in the PARTENAIRES curriculum.

This programme was one of the first to offer a shared curriculum across different disciplines (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;4: medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, pharmacy), using a small&#8208;group learning model [<xref rid="tct70199-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Shortly after its creation, a pilot project was introduced to include a patient partner alongside a healthcare professional to co&#8208;facilitate the programme's cross&#8208;disciplinary workshops. The objective was to help students make the necessary transition from paternalism and patient&#8208;centredness towards a partnership approach, the notion of which had been defined, promoted and gradually integrated by the first patients involved in the programme themselves [<xref rid="tct70199-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Students immediately valued this approach, and patient partners were officially integrated and remunerated. This was a groundbreaking educational innovation, as the few existing instances of active patient involvement in professional education at the time tended to be one&#8208;off educational experiences aimed at a single group of learners [<xref rid="tct70199-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="tct70199-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Since then, much has changed in the field and especially for us patients. The purpose of this article is to describe the evolution of patient involvement in this unique IPE curriculum, now called the Formation PARTENAIRES programme. In doing so, we also aim to share a distinctive perspective&#8212;our own, as patient partners&#8212;to tell the story of this transformation and the key insights we have gained along the way.</p><disp-quote content-type="pull-quote" id="tct70199-blk-0001"><p>

It is a mandatory component for students across 13 healthcare and social services disciplines at our university (audiology, dental medicine, kinesiology, medicine, nursing, nutrition, occupational therapy, optometry, speech therapy, pharmacy, physiotherapy, psychoeducation and social work), spanning six faculties and schools. Each year, the programme engages approximately 5200 students, 25 course teachers (lecturers or faculty, some of whom are not practicing clinicians), 125 patient partners and 125 clinical co&#8208;facilitators. To our knowledge, no other university&#8208;based IPE programme operates at this scale.</p><disp-quote content-type="pull-quote" id="tct70199-blk-0002"><p>

The first course introduces patient partnership as the foundation of collaboration, emphasising the patient as the primary team member. The second introduces collaborative work, while the third explores collaboration in complex, real&#8208;world situations. Each course follows a similar structure: (1) an introductory activity conducted within each discipline; (2) asynchronous online modules; and (3) a cross&#8208;disciplinary small&#8208;group workshop (see Figure&#160;<xref rid="tct70199-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Synchronous sessions, lasting 3&#8201;h each, are led by duos of co&#8208;facilitators that include a patient partner and a course teacher for introductory activities or a clinical co&#8208;facilitator for cross&#8208;disciplinary workshops.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="tct70199-fig-0001" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the Formation PARTENAIRES curriculum.</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-1" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="TCT-22-e70199-g002.jpg"/></fig><p>Initially, the PARTENAIRES programme was managed by a logistics team and a senior academic leader. Progressive and sustained patient involvement led to the creation of a patient vice&#8208;president position. During the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, patient partners played a key role in sustaining the programme through the transition to online learning and as clinical co&#8208;facilitators faced increased demands in care settings [<xref rid="tct70199-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="tct70199-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This commitment prompted the creation of a patient co&#8208;president position. Today, the programme is co&#8208;chaired by a patient partner and a professional.

All educational content is co&#8208;developed and co&#8208;delivered, except in the first course where we patient partners independently facilitate cross&#8208;disciplinary workshops. Evaluation and improvement committees for each course are co&#8208;led by a patient and a course teacher. Over the past 3&#8201;years, the curriculum has been fully redesigned in partnership with patients and in line with updated guidelines on collaborative practice [<xref rid="tct70199-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="tct70199-sec-0007"><label>3</label><title>Evaluation</title><p>Shifting relationships: Significant changes have occurred in our relationships with other key stakeholders of the PARTENAIRES programme&#8212;students, the participating academic programmes and clinical co&#8208;facilitators&#8212;that reflect the evolution of our role as patient partners in IPE.

This led to gradual distancing from our initial postures of promoting ideal patient partnership, as students could more readily question and challenge our discourses (see Table&#160;<xref rid="tct70199-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Anchoring our interactions with students in real, imperfect and messy experiences shaped by the feelings, implications and repercussions of living with illness has also allowed us to draw unsuspected and valuable parallels between our care journeys and students' learning paths. We have realised that students could be as vulnerable during their training as we often are in our dealings with the healthcare system. We feel that such a no&#8208;holds&#8208;barred approach to exchanges better enables students to experience their first moments of genuine partnership with patients, hopefully planting the seed for their future professional practice.</p><disp-quote content-type="pull-quote" id="tct70199-blk-0003"><p>

In 2017, the Tandem Patient role was created to involve patients earlier in each course and allow them to co&#8208;facilitate these initial sessions.

For example, a patient with speech&#8208;language issues would work with the speech&#8208;language therapy programme. However, logistical issues such as last&#8208;minute withdrawals forced us to adopt a more flexible pairing approach (see Table&#160;<xref rid="tct70199-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This shift revealed that our added value extended beyond a specific clinical reality, as educational objectives were still achieved, and student engagement remained high. Exposure to multiple disciplines also gave us unique insight into differences in how the introductory activities were delivered, unlike course teachers who only teach them within their own discipline. With our growing experience, we actively contributed to reshaping these activities, collaborating with various course teachers to adapt content and enhance student learning.</p></sec><sec id="tct70199-sec-0010"><label>3.3</label><title>The Evolution of Our Relationship With Clinical Co&#8208;Facilitators Through Cross&#8208;Disciplinary Workshops</title><p>In the early years of our involvement with the PARTENAIRES programme, our first contact with clinical co&#8208;facilitators was limited to an email exchange aimed at establishing the basics of facilitation. Clinical co&#8208;facilitators spontaneously took on the role of managing the workshop, structuring the session by introducing topics, managing time and speaking turns and closing the discussion. We, on the other hand, played mostly a reactive role, sharing snippets of our lived experience and intervening mainly at the clinician's invitation. As we gained confidence and pedagogical expertise, a more balanced dynamic gradually emerged (see Table&#160;<xref rid="tct70199-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We have proposed adjustments and now fully take part in discussions with students and clinical co&#8208;facilitators, taking the lead when we see fit. Furthermore, the PARTENAIRES team now strategically pairs newly integrated clinical co&#8208;facilitators with senior patient partners. In these instances, we are the ones welcoming and familiarising clinical co&#8208;facilitators with the workshops' format, content, and tools.</p><disp-quote content-type="pull-quote" id="tct70199-blk-0005"><p>

This continuity allowed mutual trust to be nurtured, leading us to gain confidence, find our place and dare to experiment!

<italic toggle="yes">A strong commitment by institutional partners from the outset, sustained through the challenges encountered, has been essential</italic>.</p></disp-quote><p>Together with the PARTENAIRES team, we are just beginning to recognise the educational value of having Tandem Patients engage across multiple academic programmes, much like bees pollinating across disciplines. Through sustained and interdisciplinary engagement, PARTENAIRES patients are developing a unique, longitudinal and transversal expertise in IPE that few other educators hold. The parallel with healthcare is striking: It is often us patients who navigate across silos, driving collaboration and witnessing blind spots in the system.</p></sec><sec id="tct70199-sec-0013"><label>4.2</label><title>Acknowledging the Journey</title><p>We hope readers appreciate the journey we have undertaken with the PARTENAIRES team. It has not been a smooth or linear path.

The level of partnership implementation we have reached probably cannot be replicated elsewhere instantly. Cultural transformation&#8212;for students, teachers, administrators and patients&#8212;varies in form and takes time.

But this shift mirrors real&#8208;life situations, where things cannot be fully controlled. This collective journey remains fraught with challenges. With 13 disciplines involved, each with its own language and approach, finding a functional balance requires continuous adjustment processes.

A forthcoming paper will detail the significant pedagogical impacts of this evolution, including on the quality of educational experiences, incorporating the voices of the other actors engaged in the co&#8208;construction process. However, our key takeaway is the importance of trusting the collaborative process itself, emerging from ongoing dialogue between patients, educators, professionals and students independently of the outcomes.</p><p>Reflecting on our modest beginnings as a fragile pilot project&#8212;when we had to continually justify the inclusion of patients in professional training&#8212;to the unparalleled IPE programme co&#8208;chaired by a patient that we have become, we feel immense pride and gratitude. With the PARTENAIRES programme's 15th anniversary behind us, we remain committed to its ongoing evolution in demonstrating that patient partnership should be at the heart of all collaborative practices and that we have so much to learn from one another.</p></sec><sec id="tct70199-sec-0115"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>
