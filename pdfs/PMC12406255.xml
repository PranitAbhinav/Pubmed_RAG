of
autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and the inhibition of autoreactive
immune cells is an attractive therapeutic strategy. Pepitem is an
endogenous modulator of lymphocyte migration. In this study, we implemented
a structural scaffold matching approach to engineer of stabilized
pepitem-based probes. Prioritizing the native helix&#8211;loop&#8211;helix
structure of pepitem, protein structure databases were mined to identify
the structurally closest peptide scaffold. Leveraging this strategy,
we developed VhTI-pep 2, inhibiting CD3<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocyte migration
in vitro with a comparable potency (EC<sub>50</sub> = 10.6 &#177;
16.5 nM) to pepitem (EC<sub>50</sub> = 6.0 &#177; 6.4 nM). Its potency
was further extended to T-cell subsets derived from multiple sclerosis
patients and highly disease-driving memory and Th1 cell populations.
Our approach will guide the design of stabilized peptide probes and
future therapeutics, overcoming the challenges associated with flexible
and linear peptides.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><graphic position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="jm5c00677_0010.jpg"/></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc-graphic"><graphic id="tgr1" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="jm5c00677_0008.jpg"/></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="fnd-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry" vocab-identifier="10.13039/open_funder_registry">10.13039/501100002428</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P36736-B</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group id="fnd-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry" vocab-identifier="10.13039/open_funder_registry">10.13039/501100002428</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZK-81B</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>jm5c00677</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>jm5c00677</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>production-flag-MathML-config-version</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>production-flag-journal-citation-display-style</meta-name><meta-value>acs-titles</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>production-flag-journal-date-display-style</meta-name><meta-value>dates-used-rcd-rvd-acc</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>production-flag-si-avail</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-alt-64</meta-name><meta-value>3f80d9662cbe52f4ed7e2082a597c7d843db3b01bb8d9fc90c8433ca26ba32bc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes id="spn1" notes-type="special-issue"><p>Published

estimated to impact 5&#8211;10% of the
population.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> This group of diseases includes over 100
distinct pathologies, which are characterized by autoreactive immune
cells causing inflammation and destruction of body tissues.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> Immune cell migration throughout the body is a detrimental contribution
to the entire immune system. However, aberrant immune cell trafficking
can contribute to the development and progression of autoimmune diseases.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> In multiple sclerosis (MS), peripherally activated immune cells
traverse the blood-brain barrier and invade the central nervous system.
The following neuroinflammatory processes lead to demyelination and
ultimately neurodegeneration.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> Consequently, obstructing
the migration of autoreactive immune cells to prevent central nervous
system damage is a promising concept for disease-modifying therapy
in MS.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> The monoclonal anti-integrin antibody, Natalizumab,
was the first clinically used immune cell migration modulator for
treating MS approved by the FDA in 2004, which was later temporarily
withdrawn from the market due to severe adverse events. Today, Natalizumab
is in clinical use for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS)
or Crohn&#8217;s disease for patients who do not respond to other
disease-modifying therapies.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"/> Fingolimod
(FTY-720) was the first orally available disease-modifying drug for
RRMS which was introduced for clinical use in 2010.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"/> The drug restricts the circulation of T-lymphocytes out
of the lymph nodes into the peripheral blood, resulting in a reduction
of neuroinflammation and a delay of disease progression.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8722;<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" specific-use="suppress-in-print"/>
<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> Fingolimod&#8217;s major target system is the five sphingosine-1-phosphate
receptors (S1PR1&#8211;5) expressed on most lymphocytes and also
other cells in general, but among others, high expression is reported
on pathogenic memory T-cells of the Th1 and Th17 lineages.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8722;<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" specific-use="suppress-in-print"/>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> Today, S1PR subtype-specific drugs (e.g., siponimod, ozanimod, etc.)
have been developed for MS as well as for treating ulcerative colitis,<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> and more candidates are in (pre)&#173;clinical development, among others
for rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn&#8217;s disease.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> However, S1PR modulators often have severe side effects (e.g., lymphopenia
or bradycardia), which limit their use in some patients.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> In addition, even though the relapse rate in MS patients is reduced
with fingolimod, the disease progression is only slowed over time,<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> underscoring the necessity for continued pharmaceutical development
in this domain.</p><p>The peptide inhibitor of transendothelial migration
(pepitem) is
a potent endogenous modulator of lymphocyte migration.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"/> Pepitem is enzymatically released from 14-3-3&#950;
proteins and secreted by adiponectin-stimulated B cells. This signaling
molecule binds to the adhesion protein cadherin-15 (CDH15), constitutively
expressed on endothelial cells (EC), and activates an effector cascade
resulting in endothelial in remodulation and release of the soluble
lipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) into the local microenvironment.
The S1PR system is a major regulator of transendothelial lymphocyte
migration. Interestingly, the pepitem pathway is dysregulated in autoimmune
disorders; e.g., in patients with type 1 diabetes, serum levels of
pepitem are reduced in comparison to healthy controls.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"/> Several studies presented that therapeutic dosing
of pepitem affects immune cell migration to the site of inflammation
and highlight therapeutic benefits of the peptide in autoimmune (e.g.,
in models of glomerulonephritis or autoimmune uveitis) as well as
inflammatory (e.g., obesity-induced inflammation or peritonitis) disease
models. The studies mainly focused on T-cells in detail, but effects
on B-cell or monocyte migration were evident as well.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

</named-content>
</p><p>Therefore, pepitem can be used to study the mechanism of transendothelial
immune cell migration and to develop new immune cell migration modulators.
Further structural information is necessary to ascertain and define
the active conformation of this peptide, thereby facilitating the
design of novel pharmacological probes. However, little structure&#8211;activity

tool for stabilizing peptides
by embedding the epitopes of interest into a peptide scaffold, resulting
in chimeric molecules.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"/> This strategy

</named-content> The selection of an
appropriate scaffold peptide is crucial for maintaining bioactivity.
Until now, molecular grafting has been used to enhance the stability
of linear and flexible peptide sequences,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr"/> and common scaffold peptides include sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1
(SFTI-1), kalata B1, and the <italic toggle="yes">Momordica cochinchinensis</italic> trypsin inhibitor-II (MCoTI-II), among others.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"/> However, little attention has been given to the epitope
structure during scaffold selection. Because the secondary structure
of a peptide greatly affects the orientation of the pharmacophore
side chains, not considering the original structural motifs often
leads to low success rates in creating bioactive grafts, rendering
this a tedious and expensive undertaking. Hence, a more rational method
is needed for scaffold selection, where the 3D structure of the original
peptide that embeds the bioactive epitope/pharmacophore of interest
is considered in the process. The available tools to evaluate the
designed chimeric grafts in silico were not powerful enough in the
past, reflecting a limitation of this ligand-based grafting approach.
An accurate structural prediction and in silico evaluation of multiple
grafting designs would considerably reduce costs for synthesis and
pharmacological evaluation, and is likely to yield higher success
rates to deliver potent and stable chimeric peptide grafts. The recent
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) for modeling and protein
or peptide structure predictions have made several breakthroughs in
this space, now enabling such studies.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> However, even
though deep learning algorithms provide helpful prediction models,
a pharmacological and structural evaluation of the synthesized peptides
is needed to confirm the success of the grafting approach.</p><p>To
implement a structure-guided grafting workflow that reduces
the tedious ligand-based design and synthesis efforts, we developed
an innovative approach, termed structural scaffold matching, which
combines structure-based scaffold mining and in silico predictions
for engineering stabilized peptides. Here, we employed this approach
to generate new stabilized and bioactive probes of pepitem. Sequence
alignment analysis of the endogenous pepitem amino acid sequence provided
initial starting structural information. Using structure-based scaffold
searches, we identified helix&#8211;loop&#8211;helix natural peptide
scaffolds suitable for incorporating pepitem. Utilizing the combinatorial
workflow, we designed and selected grafted variants with a high conformational
fit for the embedded bioactive sequence using in silico models. Six
representative peptides were biologically characterized. The conformationally
stabilized probes provided new opportunities for studies on the molecular
mechanism and supported detailed analysis of peptide&#8211;protein
interaction on the molecular level using AlphaFold (AF) predictions
of local interaction sites. In general, this study supports the development
of peptide therapeutics that specifically target immune cell migration
in the context of autoimmune disorders.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Pepitem Inhibits T-Cell Migration in a Transwell

<bold>Transwell-based migration assay to study lymphocyte transendothelial

assay is depicted. Endothelial cells (EC) are seeded in transwell
inserts and are incubated for 2 days to form an EC monolayer. On the
day before the assay, the ECs are cytokine-stimulated to induce the
expression of adhesion molecules. In the migration assay, human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are placed into the donor compartment
of the transwell setup. After 4 h of incubation time, the migrated
cells are harvested from the receiver compartment, stained with fluorescent
antibodies and counted using flow cytometry. (B) PBMCs were preincubated
with S1P for 1.5 h and then transferred into the donor compartment

</named-content> This limits in silico
work on peptide-target interactions as well as rational drug design
and development. Moreover, the peptide shows quick metabolic degradation,
limiting its in vivo applicability. Hence, the study aimed to establish
a rational design approach to capture and stabilize pepitem&#8217;s
bioactive conformation in a structural scaffold that retains its activity
but also transfers enzymatic stability in biological fluids, supporting
a broad application scope of these new pepitem-based probes.</p><p>To work on this aim, the sequence and structural features of the
14-3-3&#950; parent protein of pepitem (PDB: <ext-link xlink:href="1QJB" ext-link-type="PDB">1QJB</ext-link>) were analyzed to
receive information on potential conformations of the peptide fragment
(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>A). Interestingly,
the pepitem sequence spans residues 28 to 41 of the protein and forms
a helix&#8211;loop&#8211;helix structural motif within the 14-3-3
parent protein. The fragment is surface exposed, but it is not part
of the 14-3-3 dimerization interface or of the phosphate-binding pocket.
We aimed to identify the bioactive pharmacophore of pepitem with the
hypothesis that a minimal active sequence exists within the molecule,
in accordance with the reported activity for the full-length 14-3-3&#950;
protein isoform.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"/> The sequence of pepitem
is unique for the 14-3-3&#950; isoform among the seven human 14-3-3
proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>B).
The N-terminal segment showed moderate conservation of residues between
the isoforms (e.g., 28&#8211;31), the central amino acids (e.g.,
29&#8211;34) revealed considerable variability, and the C-terminal
segment had several highly conserved residues, i.e., Leu<sup>36</sup> and Glu<sup>39</sup> to Arg<sup>41</sup>. To gain more insights
into sequence conservation of the peptide, we investigated the 14-3-3&#950;
proteins among species of the phylum chordata. A blast analysis identified
290 sequences from as many different species (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_002.xlsx" ext-link-type="uri">Table S2</ext-link>). Interestingly, the pepitem sequence has highly
conserved residues within the chordata species, especially residues
Val<sup>29</sup> to Glu<sup>31</sup>, Leu<sup>36</sup>, and Glu<sup>39</sup> to Arg<sup>41</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>C). In addition, further grouping of the obtained sequences
into mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish revealed that
the N- and C-terminal segments are highly conserved within all species,
and very little sequence variation, if at all, was detected in mammals,
birds, reptiles, and amphibians. However, the loop sequence in fish
possesses a highly variable amino acid configuration, especially the
motif from positions 5 to 9 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S4</ext-link>).
Considering the conformation of the pepitem sequence in the 14-3-3&#950;
protein in combination with sequence diversity over evolution, it
was rational to assume that the alpha helical segments shape the high
integrity of the helix&#8211;loop&#8211;helix peptide, whereas the
surface-exposed residues of the loop region in the 14-3-3&#950; protein
preserve a bioactive epitope. To test this hypothesis, we performed
a fragment-based approach to test truncated variants of pepitem for
bioactivity. Pepitem fragments, resembling the helix motifs (truncated pep-1, truncated pep-3) as well as the
loop region (truncated pep-2) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Table S3, Figure S5A&#8211;C</ext-link>) were analyzed in a concentration response experiment
between 0.1 and 10 &#956;M (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S5</ext-link>D).
Truncated pep-1 and truncated pep-3 showed no reduction of cell migration,
with the exception of truncated pep-3 at the highest concentration,
with a trend for reduction of migration by 20.1 &#177; 14.7%. In comparison,
the truncated pep-2 decreased CD3<sup>+</sup> cell migration, for
example, with a maximum of 32.1 &#177; 18.9%, which is similar to
pepitem (30.3 &#177; 8.0%) at the same concentration (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S5D</ext-link>). The data further supported the finding
that one possible bioactive conformation is conserved within the loop
segment of pepitem. Since the conformation of the pepitem sequence
in the 14-3-3&#950; parent protein (X-ray crystal structure) may
not resemble the conformation of pepitem in the target-bound state,
but a similar or another bioactive conformation, we further aimed
for a peptide design allowing chemical and conformational flexibility
for the loop segment, which we considered a key to success for the
molecular grafting work.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>2</label><caption><p>

(D) Alignment of the VhTI peptide with the 14-3-3&#950; protein fragment.
The published structure of the VhTI peptide (gray, PDB: <ext-link xlink:href="2CMY" ext-link-type="PDB">2CMY</ext-link>) was aligned to
the extended 14-3-3&#950; protein fragment (residues 24&#8211;45)
comprising the pepitem epitope (red, PDB: <ext-link xlink:href="1QJB" ext-link-type="PDB">1QJB</ext-link>). The helical peptide framework of the
two peptides was aligned using the cealign command in PyMOL resulting
in a calculated RMSD of 2.55 &#197;. The loop sequence proved to be
more flexible in our alignment analysis than the helical segments.
The sequences used for the alignment are shown below. The numbers

a suitable natural peptide scaffold for embedding the pharmacophore
sequence in a bioactive conformation, applying a structure-inspired
molecular grafting approach. To identify and select structurally analogous
molecules, a structure-based database search was performed using the
PDB database. For this, we derived the structure of the pepitem sequence
within the 14-3-3&#950; parent protein (PDB: <ext-link xlink:href="1QJB" ext-link-type="PDB">1QJB</ext-link>). The model was
utilized as the query to conduct a structure-similarity search in

to find similarities in biomolecules.<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr"/> The initial search yielded 2,062 structures and was filtered to
retain peptides and small proteins, reducing the data set to 286 entries.
Further refinement by manual curation to select cysteine-rich peptides
containing at least two cysteine residues and sequences ranging from
10 to 50 amino acids in length. Redundant and duplicate structures
were excluded, resulting in 110 unique structures, which were classified
into 11 groups for further analysis: &#945;-hairpinins, Bowman-Birk
inhibitor peptides, &#946;-hairpinins, conotoxins, other cyclic peptides
with a single disulfide bond, other cyclic peptides with two disulfide
bonds, endothelin-derived peptide, enterotoxin-derived peptides, knottins,
scorpion toxins and an additional category named &#8220;others&#8221;
combining those that did not fit into the predefined groups. The list
of all identified peptides in the search is provided in <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_002.xlsx" ext-link-type="uri">Table S4</ext-link> and the pie statistic are shown in <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S6A</ext-link>. Based on the visual inspection of
the peptide structures across the different groups, most candidates
had a moderate global structural similarity to the helix&#8211;loop&#8211;helix
conformation of pepitem. They were identified as hits based on similarity
in electron density volumes by the search algorithm,<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr"/> but did not resemble the shape of the helix&#8211;loop&#8211;helix
motif. Similarly, prototypic natural scaffold peptides (kalata B1,
MCoTI-II, and theta-defensins), which were not identified in the initial
PDB search, do not exhibit the desired conformation. For visualization, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S6B</ext-link> shows representative structures for
the groups with an alignment to pepitem, highlighting only limited
conformational similarity. However, our PDB search identified two
&#945;-hairpinin peptides that, like the pepitem structure, adopt
a helix-turn-helix conformation (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S6C</ext-link>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>D). This
prompted a focused evaluation for structural similarity of pepitem
with other members of the &#945;-hairpinin peptide family. For this,
we evaluated five representatives of the &#945;-hairpinin peptide
family with PDB structures deposited in the public domain. First,
we determined the overall structural alignment of the candidate molecules
to the 14-3-3&#950; fragment containing the pepitem sequence. Indeed,
the alignment indicated conformational fit of several of the analyzed
peptides to pepitem (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Table S5, Figure S6C</ext-link>). As our aim was to design peptides that still had flexibility in
the loop sequence to allow for the mapping of activity of different
loop conformations, we refined the alignment by constraining the alignment
to the helical framework only, giving space for flexibility in the
loop region. We used the two alignment algorithms, &#8220;super&#8221;
and &#8220;cealign,&#8221; in PyMOL to identify the most suitable
scaffold (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Table S6</ext-link>). The virus-derived
BRSV-peptide was not further considered because of its reported immunodominance
and strong antigenic properties. Overall, the <italic toggle="yes">Veronica

the helical framework was aligned and appeared as the most suitable
scaffold. Native VhTI adopts a helix&#8211;loop&#8211;helix motif
with a two-disulfide framework connecting the helical segments. The
disulfides serve as natural restrictors for flexibility, comparable
to helix staples, leading to high stability of the entire molecule.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

configurations, replacing residues 9&#8211;14 in VhTI. In addition,
three peptides containing the full-length pepitem sequence were designed,
where the peptide&#8217;s helical motifs were incorporated in the
helical region of VhTI. The primary sequence information for the designs
is provided in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"/>

indicated that the peptides adopt the helix&#8211;loop&#8211;helix
motif, supporting the VhTI scaffold-based grafting approach (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S7</ext-link>). To further analyze the predicted
structures, model-to-structure alignment experiments were performed.
First, the alignment of the modeled VhTI variant with the published
structure for the VhTI peptide (PDB: <ext-link xlink:href="2PLX" ext-link-type="PDB">2PLX</ext-link>) resulted in a good fit with a calculated
RMSD of 0.51 &#197;. Next, the modeled structures of the probes VhTI-pep
1&#8211;9 were aligned to the published VhTI structure. VhTI-pep
1&#8211;7 showed a good fit with RMSD &lt; 1.5 &#197;, and VhTI-pep
8 with RMSD of 1.8 &#197; (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Table S7</ext-link>). Overall, the analysis indicated that the helical elements
aligned similarly in all the peptides, providing a robust framework
to home the pharmacophore of pepitem. A detailed molecular inspection
verified that slightly varying positions and length of the epitope
facilitated flexible positioning of side chain functionalities, allowing
mapping of chemical space in the various modeled peptides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>B). Based on the
calculated RMSD values and the detailed inspections, six out of the
nine modeled peptides (VhTI-pep 1&#8211;6), as well as the VhTI scaffold
molecule, were selected for solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS).
Norleucine, a bioisostere to methionine, was introduced to eliminate
the oxidation-prone methionine in position 6 of VhTI (VhTI-pep 1&#8211;5,
VhTI variant). The VhTI-peps were N-terminally acetylated and C-terminally
amidated to provide protection against exoproteases. The correct disulfide
connectivity was ensured through a directed folding strategy. The
synthesized and folded peptides were purified, and mass spectrometric
analysis confirmed the correct masses (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S2B&#8211;G</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>3</label><caption><p>

The VhTI scaffold adopts a very similar conformation but allows for
the display of different loop motifs based on the amino acid configuration.
The view shows an overlay of the different models in the grafted loop

6 (gray). The grafted amino acids are labeled with one-letter codes,
and their position in the corresponding peptide is indicated. (C)
The effect on the migration of CD3<sup>+</sup> cells was assessed
for the peptides. A migration index relative to the migrated cells
in the pepitem-treated control group was calculated (pepitem-treated
samples were set as 1.0 in order to compare the effects of pepitem
with the designed peptides and the empty VhTI scaffold). The dotted
line represents the fraction of migrated cells in the untreated control.

the inhibition of T-lymphocyte migration was studied in a transwell
migration assay for the peptides in two concentrations. Compared to
pepitem, VhTI-pep 1 and VhTI-pep 3&#8211;6 had reduced bioactivity,
as indicated by an increase in the migration index relative to pepitem
(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>C). At 0.1
&#956;M, VhTI-pep 3&#8211;5 displayed only weak effects on CD3<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte migration. VhTI-pep 1 and VhTI-pep 6 reduced CD3<sup>+</sup> cell migration by 25.6 &#177; 6.4% and 27.0 &#177; 9.7%,
respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"/>
</xref>). The VhTI scaffold itself had no effects, equal to untreated control
conditions. VhTI-pep 2 outperformed all other analogs with similar
activity (28.7 &#177; 6.4%) compared to pepitem (26.7 &#177; 5.3%; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>

of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes as well as memory

VhTI-pep 2 inhibited CD4<sup>+</sup> cell migration at a concentration
of 0.1 &#956;M by 34.3 &#177; 8.0%, whereas VhTI-pep 1 only inhibited
this subset by 23.5 &#177; 9.7%. Even though both VhTI-pep 1 and 2
displayed good activity, VhTI-pep 2 was the superior candidate, taking
into account the consistent effects toward all tested T-lymphocyte
populations. All probes had no recorded cell cytotoxicity on the EC
up to 1 &#956;M (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S8</ext-link>). In summary,
the serum stability of all tested probes was increased in comparison

</sup>N heteronuclear 2D experiments were recorded
at natural abundance, and the data were of exceptional quality with
sharp lines and excellent signal dispersion, consistent with a highly
ordered structure. Complete resonance assignments were achieved for
all backbone and side chain resonances, and no additional resonances
suggesting minor conformations were observed (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S9A&#8211;D</ext-link>). The Pro residue was in a trans conformation

shifts. The NMR data were used to derive structural restraints, including
interproton distances, backbone and side chain dihedral angles, and
hydrogen bonds. These allowed the calculation of the solution structure
of VhTI-pep 2 using simulated annealing approaches and energy minimization
in explicit water.<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr"/> A structural ensemble
of the 20 best conformations was produced (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S9E</ext-link>), and structural statistics were generated (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Table S8</ext-link>). The backbone and side chain RMSDs
were 0.31 &#197; and 0.99 &#197;, respectively, resulting from an
unusually large number of restraints for such a small peptide, supporting
a structure of excellent quality. The structure was, as predicted,
a helix&#8211;loop&#8211;helix fold stabilized by the disulfide
bonds and by a large number of backbone hydrogen bonds and side chain
interactions. The latter included hydrophobic packing, <italic toggle="yes">e.g.,</italic> involving Tyr<sup>8</sup>, Leu<sup>18</sup>

Glu<sup>16</sup>, Asp<sup>23</sup>

C-terminal helical surface (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"/>

the grafted sequence was partially located in the loop segment; in
detail, Gln<sup>10</sup> was attributed to the helical structure,
while GAEL<sup>11&#8211;14</sup> contributed to the loop segment.
Measurements suggested that the QGA<sup>10&#8211;12</sup> sequence
contained the most dynamic residues in the peptide (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00677/suppl_file/jm5c00677_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S9F</ext-link>). Therefore, these residues might adopt flexible
conformations upon binding to target proteins. Importantly, residues
Gln<sup>10</sup>, Glu<sup>13</sup> and Leu<sup>15</sup> had side chain
orientations toward the exterior space, which would allow for interactions
with possible target proteins. An alignment of the AF2 predicted and
obtained NMR structure of VhTI-pep 2 resulted in a RMSD of 1.07 &#197;.
It was noted that the side chain orientation of the loop (QGAEL<sup>10&#8211;14</sup>) was correctly predicted and overlaid almost perfectly
in both models. This excellent fit between the modeled and the experimentally
obtained structure further supported the approach to select natural
peptide scaffolds by conformational fit for peptide pharmacophore

using PBMCs isolated from healthy donors. Consequently, we sought
to evaluate the novel peptide within a more clinically relevant context.
Samples from patients recently diagnosed with MS, who had not undergone
any prior immunosuppressive therapy, were utilized for this purpose.
These samples might present activated states of the different immune
cell populations, such as an increase in antigen-reactive T-cells<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr"/> or a change in total cell count (e.g., an increase

T-cell subsets, including memory T-cells and the known disease drivers
Th1 and Th17 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"/>

to modulate immune cell migration,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"/> the

a target protein for pepitem in regulating bone formation, and in

modeled previously.<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr"/> To investigate any
potential binding or interaction sites between VhTI-pep 2 and Ncam-1

AF3.<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr"/> To visualize the 3D structures,
we used visual molecular dynamics, coloring the models according to
the plDDT scores to highlight regions of structural confidence. The

the
model with a reported X-ray structure (PDB: <ext-link xlink:href="3MTR" ext-link-type="PDB">3MTR</ext-link>) and found that
the AF3 model aligned very well with the experimentally determined

</xref>A).<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr"/> To refine this interaction, we performed a follow-up experiment,
focusing specifically on the FN1, Ig4, and Ig5 domain fragments to
improve model confidence through increased sampling. In this focused
analysis, the best-scoring model confirmed interaction with the Ig5
domain of VhTI-pep 2 with higher resolution and confidence and a local
interaction score (LIS) of 0.47 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>B). The LIS value can range
from 0 to 1, where small interaction binding interfaces or flexible
binding sites typically show moderate LIS values (0.4&#8211;0.8),
balancing stability and flexibility of the involved domains. The calculated
LIS score improved for the targeted prediction using the isolated
domains, indicating that the domain flexibility in the full-length
proteins limited global accuracy. In general, the experimentally obtained
LIS values were in an acceptable range, similar to what was reported
for training sets in the original work.<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr"/> We saw that the scaffold-embedded pepitem pharmacophore is oriented

</named-content> Here, we introduce
a novel approach for engineering stabilized peptides through structural
scaffold matching. A proof-of-concept was demonstrated using pepitem,
an endogenous modulator of immune cell migration. The pharmacophore
of pepitem was predicted by sequence-activity and structural homology
analysis. Guided by structural mining of the protein database and
matching of the endogenous pepitem conformation derived from the parent
14-3-3&#950; protein, the bioactive sequence was embedded into the
conformationally compatible VhTI peptide, creating stabilized peptide
analogs VhTI-pep 1&#8211;6. The culminating lead VhTI-pep 2 exhibited
comparable activity to pepitem in T-lymphocyte transendothelial migration
assays. We obtained a highly stabilized and high-resolution NMR structure
of VhTI-pep 2 revealing the expected loop-helix-loop motif and enabling
predictions of its interactions with its endogenous protein targets,
CDH15 and Ncam-1. This approach not only provided new molecular insights
into the SAR of pepitem but also validated a rational structure-guided
scaffold matching approach to design stabilized peptides with predictable
activity.</p><p>Despite some exquisite advantages of peptide therapeutics,

as high potency and exquisite target selectivity, they often have

a methodology avoiding tedious folding of cyclotide probes by chemical
ligation of even larger sequences on the prefolded prototypic kalata
B1.<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr"/> Similarly, the implementation of
stabilizing &#946;-turn motifs in cyclic cystine-rich peptides improved
the scaffold&#8217;s tendency to fold into its native-like conformation.<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr"/> Despite numerous advancements directed to secure
success, molecular grafting remains an experimental ligand-based approach
marked by a high failure rate.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"/> Aiming
to obtain peptides in the active conformation to improve successful
peptide design, the use of anchor residues to lock the grafted peptide
into its active conformation has been emphasized.<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr"/> Similarly, tools, such as LoopGrafter<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr"/> or advanced protocols<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr"/> have
been developed to guide successful grafting approaches. Still, the
process of scaffold selection has been largely underexplored in the
past, with insufficient emphasis on rational approaches to identify
and use conformationally similar scaffold peptides. This study proposes
to integrate rational scaffold selection together with predictive
modeling prior to peptide synthesis. Stabilizing the bioactive conformation
of the target sequences utilizing peptide scaffolds with conformational
fit to the epitope enhances the likelihood of maintaining activity
of such chimeric molecules. While protein or peptide similarity analysis
often takes advantage of the vast information available for the primary
sequence level, identifying appropriate molecules for embedding bioactive
epitopes requires prioritizing 3D structural compatibility. Sequence-based
searches often fail to capture structural congruence; therefore, tools
that assess 3D similarities are required. Recent computational advancements
have accelerated such structure-based similarity searches. Foldseek<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr"/> and Dali (distance matrix alignment)<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr"/> enable rapid structure-based library searches.
Foldseek, for example, translates the structural information into
a sequence-like format, allowing alignment-based comparisons of structures.<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr"/> We put Foldseek as well as Dali to the test
to identify suitable scaffold proteins for pepitem. However, neither
of the tools could successfully identify stabilized peptide structures,
which could serve as scaffolds for grafting studies (data not shown).
These algorithms were mainly developed for the search and comparison
of large globular protein structures. For instance, we found Dali
requires query structures longer than 30 residues,<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr"/> making these tools not well-suited for short peptides with
smaller secondary structures. Consequently, we used the built-in structure
similarity search in the RCSB PDB database, yielding numerous hits.
Manual inspection and curation revealed that the majority of the structures
achieved only limited alignment to pepitem on a global molecular scale;
instead, many attained only fragment-wise acceptable scores. VhTI
demonstrated the best conformational fit among the &#945;-hairpinin
structural family. The successful identification of the VhTI scaffold
highlights the applicability of the implemented workflow, but to augment
peptide scaffold selection, further improvements regarding the available
algorithms for structure similarity searches are needed.</p><p>Structural
scaffold matching can be enhanced by the integration
of model predictions into the selection process prior to chemical
synthesis and activity screening. In silico predictions of peptide
macrocycles have undergone a huge boost with the release of the AF
methods. For example, short macrocycles were predicted by deep neuronal
network algorithms such as RoseTTAFold,<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr"/> also supporting peptide-drug conjugate designs, e.g., for the kappa
opioid receptor.<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr"/> The AF methods, using

the field toward highly reliable predictions of natural peptides and
proteins,<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr"/> and in particular for cyclic
natural peptides with the AfCycDesign module.<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr"/> These methodologies are used to model huge peptide libraries, expanding
on a large chemical space and diversity, to rapidly develop macrocyclic
peptides for therapeutic targets.<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr"/> As
proof-of-concept for the design of VhTI-pep 2, its structure was determined
using NMR spectroscopy. The alignment to the AF3 model was very good
(RMSD = 1.07 &#197;) and overall matched the fragment displayed in
the 14-3-3&#950; parent protein. As a result of the molecular grafting
work, a superior stability in human serum of &gt;48 h for VhTI-pep
2
compared to pepitem with &#8764;3 h was detected, making VhTI an
attractive natural peptide scaffold for future work. The computational
selection of scaffold peptides with a high conformational fit compared
to the bioactive molecule, exemplified in this study with the 14-3-3&#950;
macromolecule, enhances the probability for successful peptide engineering
and molecular grafting. The methodology is broadly applicable with
the computational techniques accessible, supporting a wide application
in peptide and protein science and drug development.</p><p>The lack
of detailed molecular information on pepitem&#8217;s
pharmacophore impedes the rational design of drug candidates. Sequence-activity
relationship analysis of pepitem did not yield conclusive evidence
regarding the bioactive sequence within the molecule in the past.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"/> For example, analysis of the pepitem sequence
in chordata species revealed that the primary sequence of the peptide
is highly conserved, allowing hypotheses on a minimal active sequence
within the molecule. The study identified the pepitem segment (QGAEL<sup>5&#8211;9</sup>) as evolutionarily primed, suggesting that the matured
sequence is likely to contain amino acids that are detrimental to
activity. VhTI-pep 2 allowed for conformational analysis of the bioactive
sequence motif, which was not possible so far for the unstructured
native pepitem. Interestingly, the analysis confirmed that the QGA<sup>5&#8211;7</sup> sequence was located at the interface between the
helical segment and the loop, whereas EL<sup>8&#8211;9</sup> were
located in the loop segment. However, measurements indicated that
QGA<sup>5&#8211;7</sup> was less ordered than the rest of the peptide
and therefore might show some degree of flexibility, which could result
in a change of conformation during binding to target proteins. This
nourished the hypothesis that secondary structural elements in pepitem
are needed to display full activity. In support, we also noted that
AF3 provided some prediction outputs of native pepitem with a short
helical segment spanning the QGA<sup>5&#8211;7</sup> interface (data
not shown). On the sequence-activity relationship, Glu<sup>4</sup> seemed to be of lower relevance for activity, as VhTI-pep 3 and
5 were poor probes, whereas a minor contribution to activity could
be associated with Ser<sup>10</sup>, because VhTI-pep 1 was active
as well. Inspection of the side chain orientation in the modeled structures
of the grafted peptides, for example, the active VhTI-pep 2 was overall
very similar to VhTI-pep 3. Interestingly, besides the additional
Glu<sup>9</sup> residue, only Gln<sup>10</sup> was slightly changed
in its spatial orientation compared to VhTI-pep 2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>C), suggesting the Gln important
for activity. The different analogs mapped conformational space, which
was key for obtaining functional and bioactive peptides. At the end,
only mimicking the one conformation present in the 14-3-3&#950; protein
crystal structure, which was the unbound state and might be significantly
different than in the target-bound state, would likely reduce the
probability of success of scaffold matching. Our results corroborate
the recently proposed multiple pharmacophore model within pepitem,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"/> where at least two short pharmacophore sequences,
SVT<sup>1&#8211;3</sup> and QGA<sup>5&#8211;7</sup>, were reported.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> However, this also implies that more research is required to gain
deeper insights into the pharmacophore chemistry of pepitem.</p><p>Taking advantage of the well-structured VhTI-pep 2 molecule, we
modeled the peptide&#8211;protein interaction with the target proteins
using AF3 multimer and AF3 for local interaction scoring. Interestingly,
VhTI-pep 2 was predicted to interact with the Ig5 domain of Ncam-1,
and the proposed interaction sites were in close proximity to the
domain interface of the FN-1 domain and its adjacent Ig5 fragment.
By comparison, linear pepitem was modeled to interact with the FN2
domain of the protein, similar to what was proposed previously.<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr"/> Several peptides targeting Ncam-1 Ig-like domains
have been reported with agonistic or antagonistic pharmacology so
far, with the Ig-like domains as ligand binding sites. Among them
is the C3d peptide reported to initiate Ncam-1 dependent activation
of signal cascades leading to functional effects such as neurite outgrowth.<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr"/> In silico interaction prediction of molecular
contacts involving short linear peptide ligands is often poor compared
to the prediction of protein&#8211;protein interactions.<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr"/> Therefore, hypothesis-generating modeling results
should be validated by direct binding assays to wild-type or mutant
protein, or similar experiments, to deliver independent confidence.
Recent studies highlight improvements to model peptide&#8211;protein
interactions, and enhanced workflows are being generated to improve
the quality of the models to further support in silico evaluation
of peptide&#8211;protein binding experiments in AF.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> It can be speculated that the well-structured VhTI-pep 2 allows
for higher confidence in the prediction of interaction sites compared
to the flexible pepitem.<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr"/> The stabilized
VhTI-pep 2 can be considered a novel tool to facilitate experimental
and in silico approaches. However, to confirm the actual binding site
and binding interactions of the peptide, future studies need to experimentally
validate these proposed binding sites. This study presents the first
accurate structure of a pepitem pharmacophore, opening avenues for
more SAR work as well as rational designs to promote future drug development.</p><p>Pharmacologic control of immune cell migration is a highly valued,

the migration of memory and Th1 lymphocyte populations derived from
blood samples of MS patients. This observation of partial inhibition
of immune cell migration is based on the rather variable expression

further immunomodulatory mechanisms of pepitem by changing cytokine
production, e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10, but the molecular mechanism
beyond it remains unclear.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"/> Recently,
CD56 has been identified as an additional target protein for pepitem,
showing that CD56 activation by pepitem in osteoblasts leads to bone
formation.<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr"/> Interestingly, CD56 is a known
phenotype marker of human natural killer (NK) cells, where the protein
is associated with cell function and trafficking.<xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr"/> There is limited knowledge on the function of CD56 in other
immune cells,<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr"/> but mechanisms beyond it
may render pepitem immunomodulatory properties. Taken together, the
observed effects on T-lymphocyte migration provide important evidence
for the promising bioactivity of VhTI-pep 2, supporting its use as
a tool in molecular pharmacology. VhTI-pep 2 can easily be functionalized
at the free N-terminus, including PEGylation or lipidation to enhance
plasma serum binding, as well as fluorophores to support fluorescence-based
studies. Importantly, the enhanced metabolic stability supports therapeutic
applications in inflammatory and autoimmune disease models.</p><p>At a more general level, the presented approach for a structure-based
grafting strategy that combines structure-similarity identification
of suitable scaffold peptides and computational modeling can be broadly
applied to design a wide range of stabilized peptides (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"/>

offers a rational procedure for scaffold selection and peptide design
to improve the likelihood of successful grafting studies. The method
is universal and applicable to similar bioactive peptides and may
enhance the utilization of natural peptides as stabilizing peptide
scaffolds for peptide engineering work in the future. The findings

<bold>Workflow for structure-scaffold matching and structure-inspired
molecular grafting</bold>. (A) Structure and conformation are crucially
linked to the bioactivity and function of peptides, making information
on structural motifs essential for molecular grafting studies. Conformational
data can be obtained from experimentally resolved structures stored
in publicly available databases. Predicted models, for example, can
be utilized as well. In addition, defining the bioactive pharmacophore
or the minimal bioactive sequence is a key step in selecting a peptide
sequence, which can be integrated into a scaffold peptide. This can
be achieved, for example, by analyzing evolutionary sequence conservation,
performing alanine scanning, or testing truncated peptide sequences
for bioactivity. Structure similarity searches are suitable to identify
structurally analogous scaffold peptides, Foldseek, Dali, or the PDB&#8217;s
search function supported this work. A curation of the output is needed
based on predefined requirements, such as the presence of disulfide
bonds, cyclization, or scaffold size. The obtained hit list is curated
based on rational considerations regarding similarity to the bioactive
sequence conformation. For example, calculating the RMSD values of
the alignment of the scaffold with the bioactive peptide helps identify
the scaffold peptide with the closest conformational fit to the target
structure. (B) For the design of peptide libraries, secondary structures
should be carefully considered. A diverse library of peptide sequences
can be designed in this step. The conformation and folding of the
designed peptides can then be assessed using in silico modeling tools
such as AF. The predicted structures are manually inspected to filter
out peptides that fail to adopt the native conformation properly.
Further refinements of the library can be implemented to obtain a
conformational and chemical diversity of the library. (C) In the chemical
synthesis, the chemical toolbox is utilized to tailor the peptide,
e.g., to increase the stability of the peptides. The synthesized peptide
library is used for in vitro bioactivity screenings to identify bioactive
peptide candidates. Hit peptide(s) undergo further pharmacological
characterization, including measuring in vitro efficacy, potency,
or further used for in vivo evaluations. Experimentally determined
peptide structures may be confirmatory of the modeled peptide structure
and serve as the basis for structure-based designs. (D) A structured
peptide is suitable for homology modeling to predict binding interactions
with target proteins using in silico methods, including tools like
AF multimer. These experiments, which can offer insight into the peptide-target
interaction, aid rational design of peptides. Moreover, peptides can
be utilized for target identification through affinity-based pull-down
assays or further mechanistic investigations of the signaling pathways.</p></caption><graphic id="gr7" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="jm5c00677_0007.jpg"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Chemicals</title><p>Acetonitrile (ACN), ammonium

healthy donors was collected in serum collection tubes (Clot Activator
Tube, Becton Dickinson, Plymouth, United Kingdom, with anticoagulant)
and incubated at 4 &#176;C for 2 h to allow blood clotting. The serum
was separated by centrifugation at 1000 &#215; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for
10 min. To remove lipids from the serum, an additional centrifugation
step was performed at 15,000 &#215; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 15 min
at 4 &#176;C, after which the serum was used for the stability assays.
For this, the serum was prewarmed for 10 min at 37 &#176;C before
the addition of the test compounds. Peptides were prepared at a 10-fold
concentration in PBS and diluted to a final concentration between
60 and 30 &#956;M with the serum. The serum-peptide reaction mix
was incubated at 37 &#176;C, and 40 &#956;L aliquots were taken at
the indicated time points. To stop the reaction, samples were mixed
with 40 &#956;L of 6 M urea for 10 min on ice, followed by precipitation
of serum proteins by the addition of 40 &#956;L of 20% TFA and incubation
for at least 10 min on ice. The precipitate was pelleted at 15,000
&#215; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 15 min, and 90 &#956;L of the supernatant
was freeze-dried. The dry material was resuspended in HPLC solvent
A (0.1% TFA in ddH<sub>2</sub>O). Peptide quantification was performed
using analytical HPLC. The remaining peptide relative to the starting
point (time point 0) was calculated by peak integration to determine
the area under the peak at the designated time points and further
calculated in comparison to time point 0 min, which was set as 100%.
To calculate the half-life of the peptides in human serum, data points
were fitted with a one-phase decay equation.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.12"><label>4.12</label><title>Cell Cytotoxicity Assay</title><p>75,000 HMEC-1

protein sequences database was searched using the PAM30 matrix for
scoring, and the search was restricted to the taxon ID chordata (taxid:
7711). Hits were manually curated to remove all sequences not belonging
to the 14-3-3&#950; protein family, and only one sequence per species
was included. The WebLogo Tool<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr"/> was used
to prepare the sequence logos. For searching the PDB database (<uri xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/">https://www.rcsb.org/</uri>)<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr"/> for conformationally similar structures, the

peptide and small protein entries, after which the hit list was downloaded
and manually filtered for peptides with 10&#8211;50 amino acids with
at least two Cys residues, and duplicate and redundant structures
were removed before structural grouping of the results. Representative

of VhTI-pep 3 and VhTI-pep 6 were manually curated in PyMOL. We used
AF3<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr"/> to generate 3D models of protein&#8211;protein
complexes involving VhTI-pep 2, pepitem, CDH15, and CD56. Both full-length
proteins and selected fragments were modeled to assess differences
in predicted binding interactions. The highest confidence models obtained
from AF3 were further refined. Missing hydrogen atoms and side chains
were added using the Protein Preparation Wizard implemented in the
Schr&#246;dinger Suite. The structure was optimized at pH 7.0 to
ensure proper protonation states of ionizable residues. Subsequently,
energy minimization was performed to relieve steric clashes and improve
the overall geometry of the model. The minimization was carried out
using the OPLS4 force field with a convergence threshold of 0.3 &#197;
for heavy atoms. Model quality was evaluated using plDDT, a confidence
metric for local structural regions, as well as the interface predicted
TM-score (ipTM) and predicted TM-score (pTM) to evaluate interfacial
and global structural accuracy, respectively. To analyze localized
protein&#8211;protein interaction interfaces, we calculated the Local
Interaction Score (LIS).<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr"/> Visualization
of the 3D structures was performed using VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics),<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr"/> with models color-coded by plDDT scores to highlight
