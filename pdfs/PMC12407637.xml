In this study, we looked at how different chemicals in the blood, called metabolites, might be linked to various types of leukemia. By using a method called Mendelian randomization, we analyzed genetic data to explore if certain metabolites play a direct role in causing leukemia.</p><p>We found that each type of leukemia, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), is associated with unique changes in metabolism. For example, ALL showed links to altered energy use and redox balance (important for controlling cell damage), while AML was connected to changes in sugar metabolism. CLL and CML had associations with lipid metabolism and oxidative stress, which can affect how cells grow and survive.</p><p>These findings are important because they suggest potential new biomarkers (measurable signs) in the blood that could help doctors diagnose leukemia more accurately or develop targeted treatments. Understanding the specific metabolic changes in each type of leukemia may also open up new approaches to personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to the metabolic needs of each patient&#8217;s leukemia subtype.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS</title><p>

The global incidence of leukemia has shown a consistent upward trend, increasing from 354,500 diagnosed cases in 1990 to 518,500 in 2017 [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although significant progress has been made in treatment modalities, including chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies, the prognosis for a substantial proportion of leukemia patients remains unsatisfactory, underscoring the urgent need for a more comprehensive understanding of the disease&#8217;s underlying mechanisms [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, the role of metabolomics in cancer biology has gained significant attention, particularly concerning leukemia [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#8211;8</xref>]. Metabolomics, the comprehensive profiling of small-molecule metabolites within biological systems, provides critical insights into disease-specific metabolic reprogramming. In cancer, this metabolic reprogramming supports the rapid proliferation, survival, and adaptability of tumor cells within challenging microenvironments [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Previous studies have implicated alterations in metabolic pathways, including the dysregulation of glucose, amino acid, and lipid metabolism, in the pathogenesis and progression of leukemia [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10&#8211;12</xref>]. However, while these studies provide a broad understanding of metabolic changes in leukemia, few have investigated the specific causal relationships between circulating plasma metabolites and the distinct leukemia subtypes.</p><p>A significant challenge in metabolic research lies in differentiating correlation from causation. Conventional observational studies are often confounded by reverse causality and unmeasured variables [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To overcome these limitations, Mendelian randomization (MR) presents a powerful epidemiological strategy. By utilizing genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs), MR allows for the inference of causal relationships between exposures, such as metabolite levels, and disease outcomes, such as leukemia [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This approach leverages the random allocation of alleles during meiosis, minimizing the impact of confounding factors and providing more reliable evidence of causality.</p><p>In this study, we applied two-sample MR to investigate the causal effects of plasma metabolites on the risk of developing different leukemia subtypes. We analyzed 690 plasma metabolites and 143 metabolite ratios across ALL, AML, CLL, and CML. Our findings reveal the distinct roles that specific metabolites, such as Dihydroferulate and Laurylcarnitine, play in leukemia progression, suggesting potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Our study provides a comprehensive landscape of plasma metabolites&#8217; causal relationships with leukemia subtypes, advancing our understanding of metabolic contributions to leukemia and highlighting novel avenues for treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" disp-level="1" id="S0002"><label>2.</label><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="S0002-S2001"><label>2.1.</label><title>Study cohort and research design</title><p>The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the exposure factors in this study were obtained from a previously published study, which identified genes linked to 690 metabolites and 143 metabolite ratios by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), integrating data on metabolic genes and gene expression [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Genetic data for the four primary leukemia subtypes were sourced from GWAS database. Diagnoses of ALL, AML, CLL and CML adhered to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), with corresponding ICD-10 codes C91.0, C92.0, C91.1, and C92.1.</p><p>The analytical process is outlined in <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Circulating plasma metabolite levels was the exposure variables, and the presence of leukemia was the outcome. We conducted a rigorous selection of the obtained SNPs to ensure they have strong relevance to the exposure and mutual independence. Following this, we preprocessed the data to standardize the format. Subsequently, we performed the MR analysis using five distinct statistical methods. To assess the robustness of our findings, we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses, including tests for potential pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Finally, the results were visualized using three types of graphical representations: forest plots, funnel plots, and scatter plots.</p><fig position="float" id="F0001" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Flowchart of Mendelian Randomization analysis employed in this study.

However, given the limited number of SNPs meeting this criterion, we broadened the threshold to 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<bold><sup>&#8722;</sup></bold><sup>5</sup> to ensure an adequate number of eligible IVs.</p><p>Second, to address the independence assumption by minimizing linkage disequilibrium (LD), we performed a clumping process. This was implemented by setting a pairwise r<sup>2</sup> threshold to less than 0.001 within a physical distance window of 10,000 kilobases. The European ancestry population from the 1000 Genomes Project was used as the reference panel for LD estimation [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Third, to enhance statistical power, reduce the potential for false positives, and improve the robustness of the analysis, we addressed potential issues related to low-frequency variants. SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of less than 0.01 were excluded. Low-frequency variants can introduce sampling variability and may involve more complex genetic architectures, potentially complicating the interpretation of the data.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0002-S2004"><label>2.4.</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In this study, we employed a comprehensive analytical strategy utilizing five distinct statistical methods to evaluate genetic associations and causal relationships. The Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method, known for providing fixed-effects estimates, was used under the assumption of a homogeneous causal effect across all genetic variants, offering a unified measure of association and enhancing statistical power when horizontal pleiotropy is absent [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To detect and adjust for potential horizontal pleiotropy, we applied MR-Egger regression, which provides an estimate of the average pleiotropic effects [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The Weighted Median method, a robust approach less sensitive to outliers, offers a more reliable causal effect estimate by prioritizing the central tendency of the data, particularly useful in the presence of heterogeneous results [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We also incorporated the Weighted Mode method, which identifies the causal estimate supported by the largest number of genetic variants, weighted by their precision, highlighting the most consistent findings [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Finally, the Simple Mode method was used to identify the most frequently causal estimate without considering precision [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The integration of these five methods allowed us to rigorously cross-validate our findings and ensure a thorough and robust examination of the genetic data, aiming to construct a well-rounded and multi-faceted understanding of the genetic associations under investigation, thereby strengthening the validity of our conclusions and providing a robust foundation for future research in this field.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0002-S2005"><label>2.5.</label><title>Pleiotropy and sensitivity analysis</title><p>We applied MR-Egger regression to examine the potential for pleiotropic effects, where a single genetic variant affects multiple traits. In this analysis, the intercept term serves as an estimation of the average horizontal pleiotropic effect across all IVs [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We also considered the asymmetry in the funnel plot as a potential signal for the presence of pleiotropy.

By leveraging genetic variants as proxies for metabolite concentrations, we identified specific associations between SNPs linked to certain plasma metabolites and the risk of developing distinct leukemia subtypes. While our MR analysis establishes these genetic associations, further functional studies, such as metabolomics profiling and extracellular flux analysis in leukemia cell lines, are essential to directly characterize the metabolic reprogramming underlying these subtypes and validate the specific roles of the identified metabolites in leukemic cell survival and proliferation. Nonetheless, our findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how genetically influenced metabolic factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of different leukemia subtypes, highlighting potential pathways for future investigation and targeted therapeutic strategies.</p><p>The observed positive causal relationship between GlcNAc and AML underscores the dependence of AML cells on glycosylation pathways to support their rapid proliferation. This dependency is likely mediated by O-linked &#946;-<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT), which modifies key proteins involved in AML cell proliferation and survival. Specifically, O-GlcNAc modifications can stabilize oncogenic transcription factors such as c-Myc and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), enhancing their transcriptional activity and promoting the expression of genes essential for leukemic transformation [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25&#8211;27</xref>]. Moreover, aberrant glycosylation can alter cell surface receptors, influencing interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment and promoting leukemic cell adhesion and migration. These modifications can also impair anti-tumor immune responses. For example, recent studies have shown that the glycosyltransferase ST3 &#946;-Galactoside &#945;-2,3-Sialyltransferase 4 (ST3GAL4) promotes immune evasion in AML by synthesizing Sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 9 (Siglec-9) ligands on the leukemic cell surface, thereby suppressing macrophage phagocytosis [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Similarly, altered glycosylation patterns of CD38 have been linked to reduced antibody recognition and immune evasion in AML, further highlighting the immunoregulatory consequences of glycan remodeling [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Beyond immune escape, glycosylation also affects signaling and therapy resistance [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For instance, the glycosylation status of mutant Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) influences its localization and downstream signaling, and pharmacologic targeting of FLT3 glycosylation has shown therapeutic promise in preclinical models [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Collectively, these findings suggest that the glycosylation pathway could serve as a critical metabolic vulnerability in AML. Inhibiting enzymes such as OGT or ST3GAL4 may selectively impair AML progression by disrupting glycan-dependent oncogenic signaling and immune evasion, potentially sparing non-leukemic cells that do not exhibit these dependencies.</p><p>In CLL, we observed a positive causal association with butyrate/isobutyrate, a finding that contrasts with its generally reported protective role in other cancers. This suggests that CLL cells may exploit butyrate as a resource to fuel cellular processes uniquely beneficial to their slower, accumulative growth pattern. Butyrate may act as a substrate to support CLL-specific metabolic needs, potentially contributing to histone acetylation processes that prevent cell cycle arrest, or even modulating the immune microenvironment in a way that favors CLL cell persistence. This finding challenges the conventional understanding of butyrate solely as a tumor suppressor and raises the possibility that inhibiting butyrate metabolism could impair CLL progression [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], thereby transforming a normally protective metabolite into a targetable vulnerability within this specific leukemic context.</p><p>Our study also identified a negative causal relationship between piperine and CML, underscoring the therapeutic potential of phytochemicals in leukemia treatment. Piperine, a bioactive compound in black pepper, has demonstrated the ability to inhibit cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis through mitochondrial pathways [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In CML, piperine may trigger apoptosis by enhancing mitochondrial membrane permeability or activating caspases specific to leukemic cells [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], suggesting its potential utility as an adjunct therapy to potentiate the effects of existing treatments such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This also underscores the broader potential of natural compounds in disrupting metabolic processes critical for CML cells survival, opening avenues for combination therapies that exploit CML&#8217;s metabolic vulnerabilities.</p><p>In ALL, the observed negative causal association with Ceramide reflects the therapeutic potential of lipid metabolism [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Ceramide, a bioactive lipid with a dual role in cellular signaling, often induces apoptosis in cancer cells [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In ALL, elevating ceramide levels could be a strategy to promote leukemic cell death by enhancing stress signals within the plasma membrane microdomains or activating caspase-dependent apoptosis pathways. Moreover, sphingomyelin, a precursor to ceramide, also exhibited a negative association with ALL and CLL, suggesting that disrupting the sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway could impair the ability of leukemic cells to manage oxidative stress and cell death signaling. The bidirectional role of sphingosine further underscores that, beyond specific metabolites, growing evidence suggests that systemic dyslipidemia may create a permissive environment for leukemic transformation. Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, and reduced HDL-C have been linked to low-grade inflammation and chronic oxidative stress, both of which drive genomic instability in hematopoietic cells [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Clinical studies have demonstrated that abnormal lipid profiles and inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are associated with a higher risk of AML progression in MDS patients [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Mechanistically, dysregulated lipid fractions promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, DNA damage, and endothelial dysfunction, thereby contributing to clonal evolution and leukemic stem cell survival [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Although our dataset did not include conventional lipid panels, our findings on sphingolipids and plasmalogens align with this broader pathogenic axis and underscore the need for integrative lipidomic profiling in future leukemia studies.</p><p>The bidirectional role of sphingosine further underscores the complexity of metabolic regulation in leukemia. While sphingosine is generally pro-apoptotic in ALL, in CML it showed a positive association, indicating it may be involved in promoting CML development. This dual role suggests a potential difference in how sphingosine metabolism is regulated in these two leukemia subtypes. For instance, CML cells might exhibit altered expression or activity of enzymes involved in sphingosine metabolism, such as sphingosine kinase, which converts sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is a bioactive lipid with known pro-survival and proliferative effects, and its increased production could potentially enhance CML malignancy [<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, our MR study infers these differences based on genetic associations with metabolite levels, and does not directly measure enzyme activity or protein levels. Further research, including experiments assessing the expression and activity of key sphingosine metabolic enzymes, would be necessary to confirm these potential mechanisms and the precise role of sphingosine metabolism in each subtype. These findings reveal that while targeting sphingosine metabolism could have different effects in ALL and CML, the specific mechanisms and the feasibility of such targeting require further investigation.</p><p>Collectively, these findings reveal that plasma metabolites are not merely biomarkers of leukemia but active participants in its progression, with each subtype exploiting unique metabolic pathways to support its survival. This study offers a framework for developing subtype-specific metabolic interventions, paving the way for therapies that target the unique metabolic vulnerabilities of each leukemia subtype. For example, therapeutic strategies could focus on selectively inhibiting glycosylation pathways in AML, targeting butyrate metabolism in CLL, utilizing piperine or similar phytochemicals in CML, and disrupting ceramide or sphingomyelin pathways in ALL and CLL. Such targeted approaches would not only enhance treatment efficacy but also reduce off-target effects by sparing non-leukemic cells that do not rely on these pathways.</p><p>While our findings provide strong support for the causal roles of specific plasma metabolites in leukemia subtypes, it is also important to consider broader metabolic processes that interact with these pathways. In parallel, oxidative stress appears to play a dual role in leukemia. On one hand, elevated ROS can drive genomic instability and leukemic transformation by damaging DNA and impairing redox homeostasis. On the other hand, leukemic stem cells exploit redox adaptation to evade therapy-induced ROS toxicity. For instance, circFAM193B and the IRE1&#945;-XBP1 pathway modulate ROS levels to support either leukemia stem cell survival or hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) maintenance, respectively [<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42&#8211;43</xref>]. These findings emphasize the need to carefully balance redox-targeted therapies to selectively eliminate leukemic clones without compromising normal hematopoiesis.</p><p>While our findings provide strong support for the causal role of plasma metabolites in leukemia, several limitations should be noted. The relaxed SNP selection threshold and the European descent of our cohort may limit the generalizability of our results. Nonetheless, our extensive sensitivity analyses and the consistent findings across multiple MR methods enhance the reliability of our conclusions. Future studies with more diverse populations, stricter genetic thresholds and experimental validation will be crucial to confirm these insights.</p><p>In conclusion, our MR study significantly advances the understanding of leukemia&#8217;s metabolic underpinnings by identifying distinct metabolic reprogramming patterns across four major subtypes. By mapping these subtype-specific metabolic dependencies, we establish a foundation for developing targeted metabolic therapies that address the unique vulnerabilities of each leukemia type. These findings offer a promising path toward precision medicine in leukemia, with potential implications for early detection, prognosis, and metabolically tailored treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM3380" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="IFSO_A_2527015_SM3380.zip" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mingjie Chen (Shanghai NewCore Biotechnology Co., Ltd) for providing data analysis and visualization support.</p></ack><sec disp-level="1" id="S0005"><title>Author contributions</title><p>CL conceptualized the study and reviewed and revised the manuscript.
