Mucin-like glycoproteins play a critical role in parasite attachment and invasion and therefore serve as potential protective antigens against reinfection. Muc25 is a highly polymorphic mucin that has been associated with differences in host infectivity in comparative genomic analyses. To study the function of Muc25, we determined its localization and secretion in <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> by genome editing. Endogenous gene tagging revealed that Muc25 is stored in small granules of sporozoites and secreted into host microvilli after invasion. Deletion of the signal peptide affected Muc25 localization and secretion, as the Muc25&#916;SP protein was localized to the membrane in sporozoites and remained within intracellular life stages. In addition, a <italic toggle="yes">Muc25</italic> knockout strain (<italic toggle="yes">&#916;Muc25</italic>) was easily generated, indicating that Muc25 is not critical for parasite survival. However, the <italic toggle="yes">&#916;Muc25</italic> strain showed reduced growth in HCT-8 cells, and the survival time was prolonged in GKO mice infected with <italic toggle="yes">&#916;Muc25</italic> compared to those infected with Muc25&#8211;3&#8201;HA. Transcriptome analysis revealed that <italic toggle="yes">&#916;Muc25</italic> parasites caused less damage to host cells <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> than Muc25&#8211;3&#8201;HA parasites. Taken together, these data provide evidence for the export of a <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> protein to host microvilli and demonstrate that such manipulation of the host cell response may be involved in parasite pathogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic></kwd><kwd>glycoprotein</kwd><kwd>mucin</kwd><kwd>effector</kwd><kwd>parasite&#8211;host interaction</kwd><kwd>microvillus</kwd></kwd-group><support-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="open-funder-registry">10.13039/501100001809</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32030109</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020B0301030007</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>111 Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>D20008</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Specific University Discipline Construction Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023B10564003</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [32030109 and 32473052], Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research [2020B0301030007], 111 Project [D20008], and Specific University Discipline Construction Project [2023B10564003].</funding-statement></funding-group></support-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="1"/><word-count count="6991"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" disp-level="1" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cryptosporidiosis, a disease caused by the intracellular pathogen <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic>, is one of the leading causes of moderate to severe diarrhea in humans and animals [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Importantly, cryptosporidiosis in children can increase the risk of malnutrition, stunted growth, and even death in resource-poor countries [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There is no effective treatment for cryptosporidiosis. Nitazoxanide, the only FDA-approved drug, has low efficacy in malnourished children and immunocompromised individuals [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A vaccine would be the most impactful tool to reduce pediatric cryptosporidiosis. However, the development of a vaccine to prevent human cryptosporidiosis remains in the experimental stage [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. More basic research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of host&#8211;parasite interaction in <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic>.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> forms an intracellular niche at the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells. The parasite resides between the outer and inner membranes of host cells at the apical surface of the epithelium, where it undergoes a complex life cycle. During infection, the parasite rapidly remodels the host cell including formation of a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and establishment of a complex structure, the feeder organelle, at the host-parasite interface [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6&#8211;8</xref>]. Prior to oocyst shedding, <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> undergoes multiple rounds of invasion and egress, with each replication taking approximately 12&#8201;h [<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. At the same time, the small intestinal epithelium undergoes rapid regeneration and turnover [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> induces remarkable pathological changes in the host intestine, including microvillus blunting and elongation, crypt hyperplasia, and epithelial dysplasia [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10&#8211;12</xref>]. Therefore, <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> infection has a significant impact on the structure of the intestinal epithelial cells, although the mechanism of this damage remains unclear.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> employs mucin-like glycoproteins to participate in the initial attachment and invasion of the parasite [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Mucins are glycoproteins composed of 20%&#8722;55% amino acids with serine, threonine and proline residues [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These residues are extensively O-linked glycosylated, with 40%&#8722;80% of the molecular weight of these proteins being O-linked carbohydrates [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> genome contains 29 genes encoding mucins [<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, the number of genes encoding mucin-like glycoproteins differs between <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> species, contributing to the tissue tropism observed between the intestinal and gastric species [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Several mucin-like glycoproteins have been identified as playing an important role in parasite attachment and invasion, such as GP900 [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], GP60 (GP40/15) [<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], Muc4 and Muc5 [<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and AGP1 and AGP2 [<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Some have been identified as playing a role in protective immunity against reinfection in humans, including GP900, GP60, CP23, and Muc20 (cgd8_700) [<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], suggesting that mucins may be vaccine candidates.</p><p>Previous studies identified mucin 25 (Muc25) as a small glycoprotein containing 72 O-type glycosylation sites and 2 N-type glycosylation sites [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the <italic toggle="yes">Muc25</italic> gene (cgd6_40) is highly polymorphic among <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> subtypes, making it a commonly used subtyping marker (MSC6&#8211;7) for this species [<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Results from population genetic and evolutionary genomic studies suggest that Muc25 is involved in the adaptive evolution of different <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> populations [<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, Muc25 may play an important role in <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> biology. However, this theory requires experimental validation.</p><p>In the present study, we localized the expression of Muc25 protein, followed its fate using endogenous gene tagging, and evaluated its essentiality for growth and involvement in pathogenesis using gene deletion. Our results indicate that Muc25 is stored in small granules in sporozoites and exported to the host cell microvilli soon after invasion. Knockout of the <italic toggle="yes">Muc25</italic> gene in <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> reduced parasite growth and host cell damage <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and prolonged the survival of infected mice <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>.

Results from previous studies suggest that several mucin-like glycoproteins of <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> are involved in the initial attachment and invasion of the parasite [<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21&#8211;24</xref>]. In this study, we have characterized the newly identified Muc25 of <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> and demonstrated that it is a small granule protein that is secreted into host cell microvilli during parasite development. Deletion of the Muc25 signal peptide blocks the translocation of Muc25 into host cells. Furthermore, the ablation of the <italic toggle="yes">Muc25</italic> slows parasite growth <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and attenuates the pathogenicity of a virulent isolate <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. These results suggest that Muc25 may play a role in <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> pathogenesis by modifying host cell responses.</p><p>Muc25 represents a third family of effector proteins that are exported into host cells. Previously, several ROP and MEDLE proteins of <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> have been shown to be exported into host cells and to modulate host cell responses. Among them, the rhoptry effector ROP1&#160;has been reported to be injected into the host cells to interact with the cytoskeletal regulator LMO7 [<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Another effector protein, MEDLE2, has been shown to translocate into the host cell cytosol, triggering ER stress [<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the present study, we have shown that Muc25, one of the largest protein families, the mucin glycoproteins, is also secreted into the host cell by <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic>. Other known members of the mucin family of secretory proteins include GP900, GP60, Muc4, and Muc5. While some of these are known as microneme proteins [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], none of them have been found to be exported into host cells. Here, we find that Muc25 can be translocated into the host microvilli, suggesting that mucins may also be <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> effectors. This is a novel function for <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> mucins. Previously, mucins were thought to be mainly involved in parasite-host cell interaction during invasion. For example, GP60 is expressed on the surface of sporozoites, is shed when sporozoites and merozoites glide on host cells and is secreted to the parasite-host cell interface during invasion [<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Another mucin, GP900, is stored in sporozoite micronemes, translocated to the parasite surface during excystation, shed during gliding, and secreted into the extracellular space during parasite development [<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Probably due to their membrane and immunodominant nature, both GP60 and GP900&#160;have been associated with protection against reinfection in humans [<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Muc25 is one of the few small granule proteins that have been studied. Apicomplexans release specific effector molecules from secretory organelles, including micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules [<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Recently, <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> has been shown to have a fourth secretory organelle, small granules, which also secrete proteins during invasion [<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic>, rhoptry proteins may be the key to parasite invasion and trigger actin polymerization [<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and microneme proteins are likely involved in parasite adhesion and invasion [<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In addition, dense granule proteins have been demonstrated to be secreted at the parasite&#8211;host interface and involved in the formation and function of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and feeder organelle [<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. To date, there has only been a preliminary study of two small granule proteins, SG1 and SG2, which have been shown to be secreted into the parasite&#8211;host interface and parasitophorous vacuole, respectively, during intracellular development [<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In our study, we provide evidence that Muc25 is an SG protein that is highly expressed at all developmental stages and is secreted into host cells during parasite growth after invasion is already complete. These results suggest that SG proteins, in addition to rhoptry proteins, may also be exported into host cells as <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> effectors [<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The secretion of both MEDLE2 (at 5.5&#8201;hours) and Muc25 (at 2.5&#8201;hours) into the host cell cytosol occurs after PV is fully formed [<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, as with <italic toggle="yes">Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, there may be two waves of effector secretion: one by rhoptry proteins during invasion and another one by dense granule and small granule proteins during parasite development.</p><p>More importantly, Muc25 is the first <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> protein being shown to be exported into host microvilli, providing new insight into a potential mechanism of microvillar modulation by the parasite. Diarrheal diseases resulting from enteric infections may be associated with impaired epithelial barrier function [<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Cryptosporidiosis is a leading cause of diarrhea in children and young animals [<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In addition, <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> infection causes pathological changes in the small intestine, including cell death, alterations in tight and adherens junctions, and loss of the microvillar brush border [<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. On the other hand, during parasite invasion, the attached sporozoites are engulfed by host cells, and the adjacent microvilli undergo elongation [<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrate that Muc25 is secreted into host cell microvilli and may therefore be involved in <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic>-associated microvillar remodeling. However, the underlying mechanism of <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic>-mediated host microvillar damage remains unknown.</p><p>Although Muc25 export into host microvilli is not critical for parasite survival, it is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic>. In this study, we were able to directly knock out the <italic toggle="yes">Muc25</italic> gene in <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic>. Although the gene deletion reduced parasite growth <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, we did not observe significant differences in parasite load between GKO mice infected with <italic toggle="yes">&#916;Muc25</italic> and Muc25-3&#8201;HA. However, this could be due to the highly virulent nature of the <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> strain used, which induces extremely high parasite loads and mortality in GKO mice. The longer survival of GKO mice infected with <italic toggle="yes">&#916;Muc25</italic> compared to those infected with Muc25-3&#8201;HA also supports the role of Muc25 in <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> pathogenesis. Mechanistically, transcriptomic analysis revealed that the host genes associated with adherens junctions and amino acid metabolism were downregulated in <italic toggle="yes">&#916;Muc25</italic>-infected HCT-8 cells compared to Muc25-3&#8201;HA-infected cells. Previous studies have shown that <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> infection can lead to the disruption of barrier function through the downregulation of epithelial tight junctions and adherens junctions [<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The disorganization of cellular junctions reduces intestinal epithelial integrity [<xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], which is a major cause of diarrhea during enteric infections [<xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanism of Muc25 in <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Further biological investigations into the mechanism of action of Muc25 should be conducted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM2341" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplementary_Table_S1_20250228.xlsx</title></caption><media xlink:href="KVIR_A_2553780_SM2341.xlsx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM2340" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Figure S3.tif</title></caption><media xlink:href="KVIR_A_2553780_SM2340.tif" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM2339" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Figure S1.tif</title></caption><media xlink:href="KVIR_A_2553780_SM2339.tif" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM2338" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Author Checklist_Muc25_Revision_20250603.pdf</title></caption><media xlink:href="KVIR_A_2553780_SM2338.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM2337" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Muc25_Revised manuscript_clean copy_for editor_20250603.docx</title></caption><media xlink:href="KVIR_A_2553780_SM2337.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM2336" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Figure S2.tif</title></caption><media xlink:href="KVIR_A_2553780_SM2336.tif" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jilei Huang of the Instrumental Analysis &amp; Research Center, South China Agricultural University for technical assistance in electron microscopy.</p></ack><sec sec-type="COI-statement" disp-level="1" id="s0005"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).</p></sec><sec sec-type="author-contributions" disp-level="1" id="s0006"><title>Author contributions</title><p>NL and LX designed and supervised the research.
