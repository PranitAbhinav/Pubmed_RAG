</p><p>On my first quick reading through of this book on influential pioneers of social psychiatry, I felt that it can be likened to a pilgrimage. I was not acquainted with some of these &#8220;influencers.&#8221; Learning about them was enlightening. I will certainly follow-up on Theodor W Adorno.</p><p>The book took me back to summer holidays in my grandparents&#8217; place, when aunts and uncles and cousins would visit together and talk about family members, who they were, what they did, and what they meant. Gossamer threads that created kinship and extended selves. &#8220;The Glow of synthesis&#8212;12 Beacons of Light in Social Psychiatry&#8221; by Roy Abraham Kallivayalil, Rama Rao Gogineni, and Salman Akhtar should be read out in avuncular groups, a chapter at a time&#8212;with wistfulness and wonder (the editors should consider publishing it as an audiobook). The book belongs to the Montessori of social mental health learning. Of course, it also serves as a reference book&#8212;an especially useful compendium of lives and contributions of 12 pioneers. And for a good measure, a teaser-trailer on 13 more.</p><p>From Durkheim to Leff, &#8220;the Glow of Synthesis&#8221; provides a lively entry point to the field of social psychiatry, as it developed over the last 150 years. Each chapter follows a format: introduction, brief biography, list of notable publications, major contributions, status, and concluding remarks. The brief but helpful biography contextualizes each pioneer&#8217;s work. The &#8220;major contributions&#8221; provides a bird&#8217;s eye view of their important works. Instead of &#8220;Current status,&#8221; I would have preferred a section on &#8220;Impact on social psychiatry&#8221; as the contribution of many progenitors straddles multiple fields, often beyond social psychiatry.</p><p>Eight of the 12 pioneers were born in a 30-year period around the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century (1885&#8211;1916), eight had Jewish roots (at least in part), eight had matured in continental Europe/US, and eight had had to migrate under adverse circumstances. The British influence on social psychiatry is represented by Bierer (to whom the book is dedicated), Carstairs, Leff, and partly by Kapur. Most of the &#8216;beacons&#8217; had academic qualifications in multiple fields, Erik Erikson in six fields: Art, History, Psychology, Medicine, Montessori, and Psychoanalysis. They were &#8220;integrationists&#8221; to their core. Interestingly, five of the &#8220;beacons&#8221; were psychoanalysts, and Adorno and Mead often applied psychoanalytic principles. Social psychiatry seems to come of age progressing through (1) application of psychoanalytic concepts for analyzing social/anthropological phenomena, (2) Cross-fertilization of ideas leading to application of anthropological/social understanding to mental health issues of individuals and societies, and (3) application of anthropological/social ideas and methods to communities and populations.</p><p>Regarding the organization, I like the idea of grouping according to topics, but I would have preferred groupings with an element of chronology/stages, because it delineates better the sequence of influence.</p><sec><title>ORIGIN OF SOCIOLOGY</title><p>In my second reading of the book, I started with Emile Durkheim (1858&#8211;1917; April E Fallon, Rama Rao Gogineni), because he is a foundational figure in sociology. The &#8220;thought culture&#8221; in his times (post French Revolution) considered the individual as &#8220;real&#8221; and society as &#8220;artificial.&#8221; Durkheim was the first to argue that social phenomena, like norms and institutions, exist independently of individuals and shape their thoughts, feelings, and behavior. His work on suicide was meant as an exemplar of this thesis. He was also the first to suggest the use of social interventions (e.g., collective public projects) to address mental health issues. Fallon and Gogineni connect these ideas to the current concepts of social capital and social cohesion.</p></sec><sec><title>APPLICATION OF PSYCHOANALYSIS IN ANTHROPOLOGY/SOCIOLOGY</title><p>The next &#8220;stop&#8221; was the chapter on Geza Roheim (1891&#8211;1953; Behdad Bozorgnia), an anthropologist and psychoanalyst, who was the first to apply psychoanalytic principles to the study of cultural phenomena and social structures, the data for that were obtained both from literature, as well as his own field work across peoples of Australia, Normandy Islands, and United States. He proposed that cultural differences arise from variations in type (and duration) of trauma experienced during childhood, leading to distinct adult personality types and social structures. Bozorgnia suggests that Roheim&#8217;s ideas about &#8220;social regression&#8221; could be applied to understand trends like authoritarianism.</p><p>I then read about Margret Mead (1901&#8211;1978, Rachid Bennegadi, Rama Rao Gogineni), because of her influence on Horney, Erikson, and Carstairs (evident on reading across chapters). Through her innovation of &#8220;immersive&#8221; anthropological field work in which she often used psychoanalytic concepts to examine socio-cultural phenomena, she evocatively described the influence of culture on personality development, adolescence, gender roles, and emotional expression. Bennegadi and Gogineni state that Mead&#8217;s work challenged the then prevailing universalist approaches to understanding human behavior and development and put &#8220;cultural relativism&#8221; on a firm footing. Since, Mead&#8217;s contributions paved the way for cultural psychiatry, the omission of its icons (like Wittkower, Lin, and Lambo, among others) in this book is striking.</p><p>Theodor W. Adorno (1903&#8211;1969; Jyoti M Rao), was a prominent member of the Frankfurt School of Social Criticism. He and his colleagues theorized pressing social dynamics, sometimes using psychanalytic concepts, to highlight the ways in that social structures and cultural forces, negatively impact individual and group psychology, leading to conformity, alienation, and susceptibility to authoritarian ideologies. Rao, a psychoanalyst herself, points out that contrary to other analytically inclined pioneers, Adorno views the unconscious, an ungovernable (disruptive) force in dialectic with societal forces, as having a socially emancipatory potential. I feel his ideas bring to surface the tension between descriptive and critical social psychiatry better than anyone else; and moor the discipline to its psychoanalytic roots.</p></sec><sec><title>ANTHROPOLOGICAL/SOCIOLOGICAL INFLUENCES ON PSYCHOANALYSIS</title><p>Next up were the psychoanalyst trio: Horney, Erikson, and Fromm.</p><p>Karen Horney (1885&#8211;1952; Salman Akhtar), the &#8220;mother&#8221; of cultural psychoanalysis, diverged from traditional Freudian theory, to highlight the role of social relationships and cultural contexts, particularly as experienced in childhood (e.g., basic anxiety results from early experiences of lack of love from the &#8220;mother,&#8221; and that castration anxiety lies in the path of its vicissitudes) in shaping an individual&#8217;s sense of self and their interactions with others. Horney also helped supplant patriarchal (phallocentric) concepts of femininity with the robust appreciation of &#8220;primary femininity&#8221; and can be seen as a progenitor of feminist psychology. Akhtar melds her life and work in a seamless narrative and brings to awareness that Horney is a pivotal moment in the transition from psychoanalytic anthropology to anthropological psychoanalysis.</p><p>Erik Erikson (1902&#8211;1994; Sarah Varun Vas, Andres J Pumariega), emphasized the crucial role of social interactions and cultural influences in shaping personality and identity formation through his theory of psychosocial development. Vas and Pumariega convey the feel of Erikson&#8217;s own biographical method in synthesizing the person&#8217;s life journey and their work. They also point out that Erikson&#8217;s ideas on &#8220;community identity&#8221; has found application in understanding specific social challenges faced by minority groups and relational crises between generations.</p><p>Erich Fromm (1900&#8211;1980; Frank Tisano) believed that individuals develop a &#8220;social character&#8221; shaped by the conditions of their society. He was perhaps the first to posit that the society rather than individuals may be &#8220;insane,&#8221; and that being in harmony with an unhealthy society (e.g., a consumerist society) should be viewed as a socially patterned defect. Tisano states that Fromm is the originator of &#8220;radical humanism,&#8221; stating that creation of a &#8220;sane society&#8221; would require social structures that support &#8220;human needs&#8221; like relatedness and rootedness. Fromm&#8217;s notions of &#8220;flight from freedom&#8221; and resultant authoritarianism have dystopian contemporary parallels.</p></sec><sec><title>THE BRITISH (AND RELATED) INFLUENCES ON SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY</title><p>And then I read chapters on Bierer, Carstairs (born in Mussoorie, India), Kapur (higher training in Edinburgh, Scotland) and Leff.</p><p>In the lingo of &#8220;Gen Alpha,&#8221; Joshua Bierer (1901&#8211;1984; Vincenzo Di Nicola, Rama Rao Gogineni) &#8220;manifested&#8221; social psychiatry. He was the first President of the World Association of Social Psychiatry and the first Editor of the International Journal of Social Psychiatry. He founded the first &#8220;day hospital.&#8221; Implicit in Di Nicola and Gogineni&#8217;s description of his contributions is the likelihood that his ideas led to the concept of provision of services in the &#8220;least restrictive&#8221; settings (Open Door approach), and consumer involvement in care planning and delivery (self-determination and self-governance).</p><p>George Morrison Carstairs (1916&#8211;1991; Mohan Issac) trained in psychiatry and anthropology and had diverse impact on social psychiatry. His field studies in Indian villages led to the enunciation of the &#8220;Hindu personality&#8221; in the psychoanalytic anthropology tradition. In England, his early researches emphasized the role of motivation and environment in the rehabilitation of patients with chronic mental illnesses in the tradition of the Social Psychiatry Unit at the Maudsley. His pioneering social epidemiological studies on mental disorders and suicide in Scotland and India (in collaboration with RL Kapur), attempted to relate the prevalence of mental disorders in various communities to sociological differences between them; and establish the influence of sociocultural factors in the recognition and management of mental health problems. This stands in sharp contrast with the contemporary public health approach to epidemiology and makes the placement of the chapter on Sartorius between those on Carstairs and Kapur, deliciously ironical. Carstairs also advocated for the inclusion of mental health in primary care settings using locally available human resources (later called &#8220;task sharing&#8221;).</p><p>Ravi L Kapur (1938&#8211;2006; Roy A Kallivayalil, Rakesh K Chadda) believed in a socially and culturally grounded psychiatry. He (along with Carstairs) led the &#8220;Great Universe of Kota&#8221; study in Karnataka, India, which attempted to explore the social epidemiology of mental health conditions in the local context. Kallivayalil and Chadda state that he remained steadfast in his resistance to uncritical imposition of western diagnostic concepts and tried to contextualize psychopathology (e.g., noting that renunciation or &#8220;sadhuism&#8221; could become a culturally acceptable marginal lifestyle for some people with psychosis). Kapur had a distinctly pluralist (including spiritual and faith-based healing traditions) approach to mental health service provisioning, which contends with the usual global mental health narrative.</p><p>Julian Leff&#8217;s (1938&#8211;2021; Tom KJ Craig) contributions expanded our understanding of the contribution of social conditions (e.g., social exclusion/isolation and expressed emotions) to varying incidence rates and relapse rates in schizophrenia, pathways to care, and community care experiences of users. Craig&#8217;s narrative has a &#8220;research&#8221; review format which quaintly contrasts with the other chapters in the book that are more directly pedagogical; perhaps because Leff&#8217;s contributions&#8212;family interventions for severe mental illnesses as well as novel treatments for auditory verbal hallucinations&#8212;are contemporaneous.</p></sec><sec><title>SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH</title><p>My instantaneous response to the inclusion of Norman Sartorius in a book on Social Psychiatry was &#8220;Kuch Bhi&#8221; (translation: Anything!). I was certainly a little less surprised after reading the strenuous exhortations at the overlap between public mental health and social psychiatry in the Foreword by R Srinivasa Murthy and by D Basu in the chapter itself.</p><p>Norman Sartorius (Born 1935; Debashish Basu) is well known for his work at the World Health Organization (WHO) and his contributions to epidemiology of mental disorders, public mental health, and the impact of social determinants and cultural contexts on individual and population mental health. Basu emphasizes that Sartorius&#8217;s leadership in the standardization of international diagnosis, classification, and assessment instruments paved the way for cross-cultural comparative studies; and that he is a great global champion for the rights of individuals and stigma reduction in relation to mental health. I feel that the inclusion in the &#8220;pantheon&#8221; also has to do with the gratitude that we, the mental health professionals from developing countries, have for &#8220;the Living Legend&#8217;s&#8221; deep and committed engagement with our cause.</p><p>The &#8220;teaser-trailer&#8221; (Appendix) on A Venkoba Rao, Alan Flisher, Angel Otero, Arthur Michael Kleinman, Assen V Jablensky, Aubrey Lewis, Fredrick Redlich, George Vassiliou, Javier Mariategui, Juan Marconi Tassara, Julio Arboleda-Florez, Sudhir Kakar, Tsutomu Sakuta, Vidya Sagar, and Wolfgang Rutz, a veritable &#8220;Who-is-Who in Social Psychiatry&#8221; piques one&#8217;s interest in following up on their lives and contributions. However, I was a tad disappointed that many write ups in this section read like brief CVs rather than life sketches.</p><p>The length of the book is just right and the writing is good to excellent. However, the copyediting could have been better the repetition of segments in certain chapters was jarring.</p><p>Overall, &#8220;The Glow of Synthesis&#8221; is a wonderful resource. If one is looking for a broad and enjoyable journey into social psychiatry, this is a fantastic choice! It is a &#8220;must read&#8221; for students contemplating a career in mental health, it provides nuggets of information for those more advanced in their journey, and dollops of nostalgia for those concerned with their generativity and integrity.</p></sec></body></article>
