The clinical and societal burdens of CNS cancers are magnified by their tendency to affect younger populations, with peak incidence occurring during prime working years (20&#8211;64 years), resulting in substantial losses in productive life years and significant caregiver burdens. CNS tumours are relatively rare compared with other cancer sites, accounting for less than 2% of the global cancer cases reported in 2020.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Nonetheless, these tumours exhibit one of the poorest 5-year survival rates among all cancers, at only 12.8%.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The aetiology of CNS cancer remains unclear, but several potential risk factors have been identified, including exposure to ionising radiation (such as atomic bomb radiation and childhood nasopharyngeal radium exposure),<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> infections, exposure to viruses and allergens,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> as well as environmental factors like contaminated drinking water<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and lead.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Additionally, a weakened immune system may also contribute to the risk.</p><p>Recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies have significantly advanced our understanding of primary CNS cancers by providing comprehensive epidemiological estimates while simultaneously identifying critical research gaps.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9 10</sup></xref> The latest GBD iterations have systematically documented the global burden distribution across demographic groups and geographic regions, revealing pronounced disparities in incidence and mortality that correlate strongly with socioeconomic development levels.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Methodological improvements in recent studies include enhanced incorporation of cancer registry data and sophisticated modelling approaches to compensate for incomplete vital registration systems in certain regions. Of particular significance is the framework&#8217;s refined age stratification, which specifically highlights the substantial productivity losses experienced by the 20&#8211;64 years working-age population affected by these malignancies.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> These findings underscore the necessity for detailed analyses of prevalence, incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life- years (DALYs) across different age groups and geographic regions to inform targeted interventions.</p><p>Recent studies have indicated that advancements in medical technology have led to an improvement in the life expectancy of many CNS cancer patients.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive data regarding the burden of CNS cancer in most countries and regions worldwide, highlighting an urgent need to fill this data gap. Understanding the mortality and changes in DALY for CNS cancer patients is crucial for implementing effective preventive interventions. Currently, there exists significant inequality in the global distribution of health resources,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> underscoring the need for targeted, reliable clinical data to support policymakers in developing CNS cancer prevention strategies in various regions.</p><p>This study investigates the prevalence, incidence, mortality and DALYs associated with CNS cancer among adults aged 20&#8211;64 years at the global, regional and national levels from 1992 to 2021, stratified by age, sex and socioeconomic development.

Years lived with disability serve as a metric for disease burden, representing the years of life spent with a disease, accounting for the time spent ill and the disability weights associated with those conditions, thereby reflecting the potential severity of the disease. Years of life lost represent the number of years lost due to premature death from a disease. Both years lived with disability and years of life lost are estimated for each age, sex and location for specified years. All metrics are reported as raw values, rates per 100&#8201;000 population and age-standardised rates per 100&#8201;000 population, with age standardisation based on the WHO&#8217;s World Population Standard Age Structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Data processing and modelling</title><p>In GBD 2021, disease estimates were derived using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression and DisMod-MR modelling.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Briefly, spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression is a set of regression techniques that smooths across age, time and location. DisMod-MR is a Bayesian meta-regression method used to synthesise all available data. The Gaussian, log-Gaussian, Laplace or log-Laplace likelihood functions were employed in DisMod-MR 2.1. Age and sex standardisation were performed according to the GBD reference population.

In this study, countries and regions were categorised into five SDI levels (low &lt;0.47, lower-middle 0.47&#8211;0.62, middle 0.62&#8211;0.71, upper-middle 0.71&#8211;0.81 and high &gt;0.81) to explore the relationship between disease burden and socioeconomic development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Joinpoint regression model</title><p>Joinpoint regression analysis was conducted using Joinpoint software (V.5.0.2, <ext-link xlink:href="https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/" ext-link-type="uri">https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/</ext-link>) to evaluate trends in CNS cancer from 1992 to 2021. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) represents the weighted average of the annual percentage changes (APC) from the joinpoint regression analysis. A Monte Carlo permutation test using 4499 random rearrangement datasets was employed to compute the AAPC of the disease and its 95% CI. An AAPC that significantly differs from 0 at &#945;=0.05 indicates a statistically significant trend. If 0 falls within the 95%&#8201;CI, the AAPC is considered a stable trend.

AAPC is a summary measure of the trend over a prespecified fixed interval, calculated as a weighted average of the APC, allowing us to describe AAPC over multiple years with a single figure. APC is calculated as the geometric weighted average of various APC values obtained from the regression analysis. The value of AAPC represents the percentage change per year (increase, decrease or stability). For instance, an AAPC of 0.1 indicates an annual growth rate of 0.1%. Trend rates are reflected in the AAPC value and its 95% CI. Age standardisation was performed using the direct method, applying the global age structure from 1992 to 2021. Age-standardised rates of diseases for each country were calculated using the Global Burden of Disease World Population Standard and reported per 100&#8201;000 population. The 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UI) for each metric were reported using the 2.5% and 97.5% quintiles from 1000 samples.

In this study, we conduct a thorough analysis of the prevalence, incidence, DALYs and mortality associated with CNS cancers globally from 1992 to 2021. Over the past 30 years, there has been a significant increase in the age-standardised prevalence and incidence of CNS cancers among the global population aged 20&#8211;64 years. Meanwhile, both mortality and DALYs have declined markedly. These findings indicate that, due to advancements in healthcare, CNS cancers are no longer a major contributor to reduced life expectancy. Notably, there are significant inequalities in age-standardised prevalence and mortality of CNS cancers between countries with different SDI and across different regions. Additionally, the determinants of incidence for CNS cancers differ among various countries and regions. This study expands our understanding of the increasing global burden of CNS cancers by focusing on trends among patients aged 20&#8211;64 years. Furthermore, it calls for urgent attention to the strategies for responding to CNS cancer patients worldwide, advocating for the equitable allocation of health resources and the development of targeted guidelines. These findings are not only significant for health practices but also provide valuable insights for future research, offering actionable evidence for the clinical prevention and management of all CNS cancer patients.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Age differences in the burden of CNS cancer</title><p>CNS cancer predominantly affects individuals between the ages of 20 and 50 years globally. To achieve a more comprehensive and objective analysis, we selected a study population aged 20&#8211;64 years. Our research reveals that from 1992 to 2021, the prevalence of CNS cancers increased across all age subgroups within this demographic. Technological advancements, such as improved resolution in CT and MRI, have facilitated the detection of CNS cancers. Additionally, the development of advanced treatment modalities, including gamma knife, radiosurgery, proton beam therapy and photon beam therapy, along with the emergence of targeted therapies and immunotherapies for CNS cancers, has contributed to increased 5-year survival rates and reduced mortality. Our findings corroborate a decline in mortality associated with CNS cancers from 1992 to 2021. Notably, the most significant increase in prevalence and incidence was observed in the 20&#8211;24 age group, indicating a trend towards younger patients being diagnosed with CNS tumours, which is consistent with previous reports.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Furthermore, we found that mortality from CNS cancers rises with age, with individuals aged 60&#8211;64 experiencing mortality approximately 14 times higher than those aged 20&#8211;24. This disparity may be attributed to the more robust immune systems of younger individuals compared with their older counterparts, enhancing their ability to combat CNS cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sex differences in the burden of CNS cancer</title><p>Between 1992 and 2021, the age-standardised prevalence of CNS cancers among women aged 20&#8211;64 increased significantly compared with men, while the age-standardised mortality for female patients declined more sharply than those for males. The incidence of CNS cancers in women also rose notably when compared with men. The reduction in age-standardised DALYs associated with CNS cancers was more pronounced among women, particularly in countries with higher SDI, which is in line with previous studies.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27 28</sup></xref> These findings suggest that, compared with females, greater attention should be paid to the burden of CNS cancers in males, which may be linked to sex hormones and genetic features, unhealthy lifestyle choices commonly associated with men, such as smoking and alcohol consumption.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Understanding the underlying causes of these differences is crucial for effective management and research on CNS cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Sociodemographic differences in the burden of CNS cancer among older adults</title><p>From the analysis of the SDI, we found significant inequalities in age-standardised prevalence, incidence, DALYs and mortality of CNS cancer among countries with different SDI. In 2021, the highest prevalence of CNS cancer was observed in high SDI countries among individuals aged 20&#8211;64 years. However, between 1992 and 2021, the growth of incidence in these countries has been lower than that of low SDI countries. This may be attributed to the effective preventive measures adopted by high SDI countries facing a major burden of CNS cancers in recent years, including environmental improvements and increased awareness and advocacy regarding the disease.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The USA exemplifies this approach through its coordinated efforts involving environmental protection regulations, radiation safety protocols and nationwide awareness programmes, which have collectively contributed to favourable epidemiological trends in CNS cancer outcomes as documented in national health statistics.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34 35</sup></xref> Moreover, the DALYs and mortality associated with CNS cancer have started to decline significantly in high SDI and high-middle SDI countries. In contrast, these metrics continue to rise in low SDI and low-middle SDI countries, likely due to being reflective of a lack of access to the highly specialised services needed to treat these complex diseases.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27 36</sup></xref> The objective reason is the lack of the relatively advanced medical equipment, medications and technologies in low SDI countries.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37 38</sup></xref> These findings indicate a heavier burden of CNS cancer in low SDI countries. It is crucial to focus on effective strategies to strengthen the prevention and control of CNS cancer in low-SDI countries through targeted health policies, thereby reducing the overall burden of this disease. Currently, the prevention and treatment policies and advanced medical technologies adopted by high-SDI countries serve as valuable models for low-SDI countries.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Global trends in the development of CNS cancer</title><p>Overall, from 1992 to 2021, there has been a notable upward trend in the age-standardised prevalence and incidence of CNS cancers among adults aged 20&#8211;64 years, while age-standardised DALYs and mortality have exhibited a downward trend. This suggests significant advancements in the global management of CNS cancers. However, the absolute number of cases and DALYs remains alarmingly high.

It is encouraging to note a decline in mortality and DALYs related to CNS cancers among patients and their families. Furthermore, this study predicts changes in global incidence over the next 30 years, laying a foundational framework for future research.</p><p>However, several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. While the GBD study provides valuable standardised estimates across 204 countries and territories, several limitations regarding data representativeness merit consideration. The completeness and accuracy of source data vary substantially across regions, particularly in resource-limited settings where underdeveloped vital registration systems and cancer surveillance programmes may lead to incomplete case ascertainment. The standardised modelling approaches, though enabling cross-national comparisons, may obscure important local variations in diagnostic capabilities, clinical practices and reporting standards for CNS cancers. Reliance on modelling to compensate for data gaps in regions with limited primary sources could introduce estimation uncertainties, particularly for rare malignancies and age-stratified analyses. Additionally, inherent time lags in data availability and differences in healthcare systems across countries may further influence burden estimates. While these limitations suggest the need for cautious interpretation of country-specific findings, the GBD remains the most comprehensive effort to quantify global disease patterns, and its estimates provide important benchmarks when supplemented with local validation studies and considered alongside regional epidemiological evidence.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>From 1992 to 2021, the prevalence and incidence of CNS cancers among adults aged 20&#8211;64 years globally increased, while mortality and DALYs significantly declined.
