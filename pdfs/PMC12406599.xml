There is a growing amount of data pertaining to health inequalities. Written outputs, including academic research papers, are key tools for describing health inequalities. Epidemiologists, data analysts, policy advisors and health equity scholars can have greater impact through accurate, concise and compelling presentation of this evidence and so assist those advocating for action to close health gaps. We make recommendations to improve the accuracy and impact of written evidence on health inequality. Focusing on the micro, macro and meta aspects of developing written reports, we drew from our varied experiences promoting health inequality monitoring to identify key strategies specific to this field, which were further expanded and explored through literature searches and consultation with experts. We recommend four general strategies: (i) using terminology deliberately and consistently; (ii) presenting statistical content accurately and with sufficient detail; (iii) adhering to guidelines and best practices for reporting; and (iv) respecting and upholding the interests of affected communities. Specifically, we address the use of terminology related to health inequality and health inequity, dimensions of inequality and determinants of health, economic inequality and economic-related inequality, sex and gender, and race and ethnicity. We present common pitfalls related to reporting statistical content, underscoring the importance of clarity when reporting association and causation. We advocate for engaged and inclusive writing processes that use affirming language and adopt strength-based messaging. This guidance is intended to increase the impact of written evidence on efforts to tackle avoidable health inequalities.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Health inequality</kwd><kwd>Health equity</kwd><kwd>Analysis</kwd><kwd>Reporting</kwd><kwd>Writing</kwd><kwd>Best practices</kwd><kwd>Terminology</kwd><kwd>Language use</kwd><kwd>Affirming language</kwd><kwd>Statistics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Bloomberg Philanthropies Data for Health Initiative</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Since the 1960s, the number of scientific publications on health inequality has grown exponentially, outpacing growth in scientific publications in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There is also greater availability and accessibility of data about health inequalities. This increased interest in characterizing and addressing health inequalities is also evident in major health and development initiatives, which increasingly prioritize tackling health inequality and embedding this in their monitoring approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

The effective dissemination of evidence on health inequalities can contribute to broader global and local efforts to improve health status, with the aim of improving the lives of populations experiencing disadvantage and, thus, reducing health inequities. When communicated appropriately to the relevant audience, at the opportune time and in the right format, high-quality evidence on health inequality can guide health and other relevant policies, programming and practices designed to address health inequity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Compelling and accurate written reports on health inequality analyses provide insight into the nature of health inequities and can inform actions to ameliorate them. However, common pitfalls of reporting lessen accuracy and weaken impact. For example, ambiguous terminology and too little (or too much) statistical detail obscure interpretation of evidence. While guidance for analyzing and interpreting health inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], reporting on health data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and writing academic articles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] are readily available, there is little guidance specific to the reporting of health inequality analyses.</p><p id="Par5">This paper draws on varied experiences in health equity research to recommend strategies to help scholars and advocates write up the results of health inequality analyses with greater accuracy, consistency and impact, while also fostering more inclusive and respectful writing practices.

While there are particular considerations relevant to the measurement and categorization of any inequality dimension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], special consideration is given to sex and gender (subsection D) and race and ethnicity (subsection E).</p><sec id="Sec4001"><title>A. Health inequality and health inequity</title><p id="Par16">Differences in health between groups of individuals categorized by some dimension may be referred to with numerous labels: health inequality, health disparity, health gradient, health gap, social inequality in health, and health inequity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Each term may carry a distinct and specific meaning to some readers, and different meaning for others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. An important distinction is between health inequality and health inequity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The WHO defines the first as a measured difference in health between population subgroups. Health inequalities can be measured and monitored over time. For the past three decades, the term has been used globally to refer to health differences associated with social advantage and disadvantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The WHO definition of health inequity refers to unfair, avoidable or remediable differences in health between groups of people. In some cases, the absence of a difference between groups (i.e. a situation of equality) might be considered inequitable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Panel <xref rid="Taba" ref-type="table">1</xref> demonstrates how the two terms may be used effectively as part of reporting.</p><p id="Par27">

</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">When presenting measurements of health inequality and discussing their implications for health equity, an effective approach is to explicitly distinguish between the two concepts. This may entail presenting the results of inequality analysis (e.g. as part of the results section of a manuscript) and then discussing the supporting evidence and assessments needed for inequalities to be considered inequitable (e.g. as part of the discussion section of a manuscript). Discussion of the concept of health inequity requires contextualization to clarify how evaluations regarding fairness and justice are made, acknowledging that different value judgements may lead to different conclusions regarding equity. The following sentences demonstrate less effective and more effective approaches to writing about health inequality and health inequity as part of a hypothetical analysis:</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><p>Less effective: <italic toggle="yes">The analysis shows a large inequality in health service coverage &#8211; a 20% point difference between the richest and poorest groups &#8211; that indicates inequity favouring the richest due to greater access to resources.</italic></p><p>More effective: <italic toggle="yes">The analysis measured inequality in health service coverage by economic status and revealed higher coverage among richer subgroups. The level of coverage was 20% points higher in the richest group than in the poorest group. Supporting evidence showed the inequality was due to richer groups having greater access to healthcare resources that higher income made more affordable. Those considering such inequality in access to be unfair will view the inequality in health service coverage as inequitable.</italic></p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

It is outside the scope of this paper to resolve these debates or offer definitive guidance on the use of terminology. Rather, in the absence of a clear consensus, we recommend the use of language that best reflects the customary usage and preferences of the target audiences, and that terminology always be clearly defined and used consistently.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4007"><title>B. Dimensions of inequality and determinants of health</title><p id="Par24">The terms &#8220;dimensions of inequality&#8221; and &#8220;determinants of health&#8221; are prone to confusion or conflation.

In the interest of using health inequality monitoring to advance health equity, dimensions of inequality encompass characteristics that are reasonably likely to reflect unfair differences between population subgroups. Frameworks such as EQUALSS GUIDE Multiple [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and PROGRESS-Plus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] provide structured lists of dimensions of inequality that are commonly applied (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

</p><p id="Par28">WHO describes determinants of health as factors that affect the health of individuals and communities. They can include factors related to the social and economic environment and the physical environment, and they may reflect social context and position that is based on an individual&#8217;s characteristics and behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Evidence about determinants of health is often provided as part of the background of health inequality reports, as well as when discussing the potential drivers of inequalities and perpetuating factors. Moreover, at times it is important to monitor inequalities not only in health but in the factors that are the most important influences on health. Therefore, determinants of health may be a focal topic for health inequality monitoring, such that data pertaining to the determinants of health can be disaggregated according to relevant dimensions of inequality to quantify and track the extent of inequality over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Panel <xref rid="Tabb" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents examples of dimensions of inequality and determinants of health indicators that are featured in the WHO Health Inequality Data Repository, noting where certain factors overlap.</p><p id="Par2701">

Economic inequality and economic-related inequality in health</title><p id="Par37">There is an important distinction between economic inequality and economic-related (or economic-based) inequality in health<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>. Economic inequality pertains to the distribution of economic resources, e.g., wealth or income, in a population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Economic inequality can be measured using a variety of metrics. For instance, the Gini coefficient can be used to measure the extent to which the distribution of income in a population deviates from an entirely equal distribution in which everyone has the same income.</p><p id="Par39">Economic-related inequality in health refers to variation in health between subgroups (or individuals) of different economic status. An exploration of economic-related inequality in healthcare coverage might compare coverage of the rich versus coverage of the poor. If the richer groups have better coverage than the poorer ones, then there is a pro-rich inequality, or a pro-rich gradient or pattern in coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. If poorer groups were to report higher coverage than richer groups, then there would be pro-poor inequality in coverage (in that case, since poorer groups may also have greater need for healthcare, additional context may be required when interpreting and presenting findings).</p><p id="Par40">Although measures of economic inequality are distinct from measures of economic-related inequality in health, the former may be relevant as part of exploring the state of inequality in a health topic. Economic inequality measures can provide important background information and context about the population. Further, the associations between economic inequality and health indicators may serve as a supplementary analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4012"><title>D. Sex and gender</title><p id="Par42">Sex and gender are common dimensions of inequality explored through health inequality analyses.

Sex is a classification assigned at birth which, except in specific circumstances, usually corresponds with the sex or gender identity recorded on official documents (e.g. identity cards, passports and birth certificates) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Increasingly, however, a distinction is drawn between sex assigned at birth and gender identity, referring to a deeply felt, internal and individual sense of one&#8217;s own identity with respect to gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Gender is a social construction that reflects the norms, stereotypes, and roles expected of people according to their assigned sex (i.e. boys, girls, men, and women) and which often underpin inequalities in access to opportunities, capacities and resources. Gender identities of individuals do not always correspond to these norms and may change over time and in response to contexts.

This is important because the unit of a summary measure of health inequality &#8211; and the interpretation of findings &#8211; may not be intuitive for all audiences. Measures of absolute inequality, which show the magnitude of difference in health between subgroups, retain the same unit of measurement as the health indicator. On the other hand, measures of relative inequality, which show difference in shares of total health of subgroups or ratios of health of the subgroups, are unitless.

For example, an analysis may show that health outcomes are better among more socially advantaged population subgroups. Multiple regression can show whether a health indicator is associated with a dimension of inequality after adjustment for other dimensions of inequality. For example, multiple regression can indicate whether the prevalence of diabetes differs by educational attainment, adjusting for differences in age and sex. Compound vulnerability and advantage (assessments that quantify the extent to which certain demographic, socioeconomic and geographic conditions act together to confer vulnerability or advantage with regards to a particular health or health-related condition) take into account multiple dimensions of inequality at the same time. Such findings can link health and inequality dimension variables, establishing associations between them &#8211; but they do not support claims of causation (e.g. that change in education would raise or lower the risk of diabetes, holding correlates of both education and diabetes risk constant).</p><p id="Par70">Decomposition analyses break down variation in a health indicator or its association with a dimension of inequality into the separate contributions of measurable characteristics (e.g. education, place of residence, socioeconomic status) to that variance or association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

As another example, the term &#8220;minoritized&#8221; is preferred in some contexts over terms such as &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221;. According to the report <italic toggle="yes">Structural Racism</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> Ethnicity and Health Inequalities in London</italic>, &#8220;minoritized&#8221; reflects social processes of power and domination, unlike &#8220;minority&#8221; which references numerical presence in a population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In the context of that report, it is acknowledged that &#8220;minoritized&#8221; allows for the reality that some ethnic groups who are minorities in London are majorities in the global population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1012"><title>B. Strength-based messaging</title><p id="Par119">Reports about health inequality require sensitivity when discussing the poorer health outcomes or indicators of population subgroups in situations of social disadvantage. Often, academic reports emphasize the link between social disadvantage and poorer health, focusing on the size of the gap between subgroups. This may inadvertently stigmatize groups in vulnerable situations, reinforce power imbalances, erode trust and credibility with communities and shift the focus away from the structural factors that underlie inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Messaging should avoid discourse that represents people in terms of deficiencies, instead aiming to present an asset-based analysis, contrasting the disadvantageous situation of the individuals or communities with their strengths.</p><p id="Par120">Strengths-based approaches to reporting on health inequalities convey language and solutions aligned with overcoming an issue, shifting away from a focus on &#8220;absence, lack or failure&#8221; to a focus on resilience and strengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Thurber et al. have demonstrated approaches to support strengths-based quantitative analysis in a study involving Indigenous children in Australia.

Engaged writing processes</title><p id="Par129">As part of the writing process, engagement with the views of local experts, communities and those with lived experiences can result in a richer understanding and appreciation of a diversity of perspectives and range of experiences. This may require an openness to question established beliefs and notions. Just as written outputs may be piloted with their intended audience, they may also be piloted with affected populations to promote their acceptability, transparency and impact. This can help to ensure that writing avoids potential sensitivities and pejoratives, and that it does not perpetuate stigma, discrimination, or recrimination against disadvantaged groups. Further, engagement with practitioners (including health and social service providers, health system programmers and planners and policymakers) can enrich the understanding and interpretation of the data. Co-authoring written outputs with members of the communities represented in the research is a good practice that is increasingly encouraged (and sometimes required) by academic journals.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Emerging issues and reflections</title><p id="Par131">Well-written reports can be instrumental in highlighting health inequalities, bringing attention to key issues, and prompting important changes in policy, programmes and practices. While existing literature has provided guidance for scientific writing in general, this paper fills a gap by focusing on micro, macro and meta issues that arise in reporting the results of health inequality analyses.</p><p id="Par132">The impact of health inequality research is shaped by the multidisciplinary nature of the field. On the one hand, this underscores the broad relevance of health inequality research across diverse audiences and disciplines. On the other hand, the impact of health inequality research may be diminished by the fragmented, siloed and multi-disciplinary nature of the field, and stands to be enhanced through efforts to further promote connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We believe that establishing common guidance for writing about the results of health inequality analyses may be part of this larger effort to augment the impact of this research. Given the growing output of research involving health inequality measurements, the inclusion of a greater number of articles in systematic reviews and meta-analyses is one concrete benefit of more standardized approaches to reporting.</p><p id="Par133">The use of &#8220;micro-macro-meta&#8221; framing facilitates consideration of a wide range of issues. The strategies offered across these three levels encourage a dynamic and thorough approach to preparing impactful written reports. Of particular importance in writing about health inequality is the inclusion of the &#8220;meta&#8221; component. Traditional writing guidance, peer review and editorial feedback often tend to focus on the micro and macro aspects of writing. The addition of the meta &#8211; that is, the processes of planning and carrying out writing projects &#8211; prompts more reflexive consideration of issues, including those related to engagement and collaboration. This component holds the potential to promote impact through the written output itself by ensuring that the language and messaging are grounded in the realities of the wider audiences and populations. The writing process itself can also be an opportunity to recognize and uphold values that are often aligned with advancing health equity, such as inclusivity, empowerment and respect.</p><p id="Par134">The preparation of this paper was an opportunity for the author group to reflect upon and strengthen guidance for writing about health inequality evidence, and to consider other aspects of health inequality monitoring that require further attention. Writing is part of the larger, interlinked cycle of health inequality monitoring, which encompasses: (a) determining the scope of monitoring; (b) obtaining disaggregated data; (c) analyzing data; (d) reporting results; and (e) translating knowledge into action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Within this framing, writing is one aspect of (d) reporting results, though is linked to the other parts of the cycle. For instance, the ability to write clearly about data analysis techniques requires familiarity with the underlying data sources and approaches. Acknowledging that ambiguity in writing may stem from ambiguity in the underlying concepts, there is an ongoing need to strengthen capacity across all parts of the health inequality monitoring cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par135">Written reports and outputs, which themselves may take diverse forms, are often accompanied by other communication products, such as interactive data visualizations, videos and podcasts. We acknowledge the need for guidance to promote the accuracy and accessibility of other forms of communication about health inequalities &#8211; and to address issues that were outside the scope of this paper, including the preparation of data tables and visuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p id="Par136">The expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted tools as part of writing processes presents unique considerations, opportunities and uncertainties for those writing about health inequality measurements. Guidance from journals and professional bodies about the use of these tools, and disclosure requirements, is evolving as the tools become more advanced and entrenched in writing and publishing processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. We highlight the positive possibilities of using such tools for editorial purposes to promote equity in the writing process in the field of health inequality research (i.e. making supports available to writers who may not otherwise have access, and/or easing linguistic disparities) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Yet, the full picture of how AI-tools are being utilized and their limitations (e.g. perpetuating biases, plagiarism, data ownership issues and inaccuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]) remains an area for further study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par137">In conclusion, this paper has offered four strategies for strengthening the accuracy and impact of writing about the results of health inequality analyses, addressing the deliberate and consistent use of terminology, the presentation of statistical content, adherence to reporting guidelines and best practices and respecting and upholding the interests of affected communities. Under these strategies, we highlighted key issues and common sources of confusion in health inequality reports, as well as practical guidance and examples. The paper underscores the importance of considering multiple aspects of writing and the writing process as part of larger aims related to advancing health equity through evidence on health inequalities.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par38"> From a grammatical standpoint, it may be more accurate to indicate &#8220;economic status-related inequality&#8221; when referencing wealth, income, asset or other dimensions of inequality related to the economic situation of an individual, household, or other unit; however, this amount of text is cumbersome to report.
