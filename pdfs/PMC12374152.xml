cross-infection. The urgency in this research is ozone water as a
disinfectant is still limited and no research has been found on the use of
ozone water on tooth extraction instruments. However, ozone has
antibacterial properties so researchers are interested in studying the
effectiveness of ozone water as a disinfectant when compared to the commonly
used 4.8% chloroxylenol. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of
disinfection of ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol in reducing the number of
bacterial colonies on dental extraction instruments at the Universitas
Sumatera Utara Dental and Oral Hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The samples used were mandibular molar forceps have been used in tooth
extraction procedures. This study was experimental and used 30 sample, where
each group consisted of 10 tooth extraction instruments. The treatment group
used ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol and the negative control group was
cleaned with distilled water. The ozone water group was produced with an
ozone generator with a concentration of 15 mg/L for 20 minutes. Then the
active side of tooth extraction forceps was soaked for 30 minutes. In the
4.8% chloroxylenol (dettol&#174;) group,
the active side of the mandibular molar tooth extraction forceps was soaked
in 250 mL for 60 minutes. In the control group, the mandibular molar tooth
extraction forceps were rinsed with distilled water. After that, the sample
was counted using a bactery colony counter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results of the data analysis showed a p-value &#8804;0.001, which means
there was a significant difference in the disinfection using ozone water and
4.8% chloroxylenol on the number of bacterial colonies on dental extraction
instruments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>From this study it can be said that ozone water is more effective in
disinfecting than 4.8% chloroxylenol.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Ozone water</kwd><kwd>Chloroxylenol</kwd><kwd>Bacterial Colony</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013375"><funding-source>Universitas Sumatera Utara</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting

<sup>1</sup>
</xref> In dental practice, microorganisms can spread through blood, saliva or
droplets through direct or indirect contact. One route of cross-infection due to
indirect contact is tooth extraction instruments that have been contaminated with
pathogenic microorganisms. <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref> Tooth extraction procedures have a high risk of infection transmission due
to contact of the instruments with the patient&#8217;s blood and saliva. <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> These must be aseptic at the time of tooth extraction to avoid bacterial
infection, which is one of the complications that can occur as a result of tooth
extraction. <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> If the tooth extraction instrument is contaminated, microorganisms can be
transmitted to dentists, nurses, or other patients who will be infected with
diseases. <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> According to the American Dental Association (ADA), it is estimated that
dentists and patients may be exposed to around 40 types of infectious diseases when
carrying out dental treatment procedures. Therefore, it is necessary to exercise
prevention by disinfecting dental extraction instruments. <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
</p><p>Alternative materials for disinfection in dentistry have been developed. Ozone water
can function as a disinfectant with the ability to oxidize amino acids and destroy
proteins in the cellular membranes of microorganisms. <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref> Ozone water has the ability to kill pathogenic microorganisms and the
resulting wastewater is safe to enter waterways. <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Chloroxylenol or para-chloro-meta-xylenol (PCMX) is a chemical-level
disinfectant commonly used to disinfect skin and surgical instruments in dentistry.
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref> 4.8% chloroxylenol has a broad-spectrum antibacterial ability that can kill
most bacteria and fungi. 4.8% chloroxylenol works by denaturing proteins, changing
the permeability of cell walls and causing cell leakage. 4.8% chloroxylenol is one
of the most widely used disinfectants in dentistry. 4.8% chloroxylenol is one of the
phenol groups, and works by denaturing proteins, changing the permeability of cell
walls and causing cell leakage. <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>Research conducted by Ochie K and Ohagwu C in 2009 demonstrated that 3.5% sodium
hypochlorite was the most effective in disinfecting x-ray equipment and accessories,
followed by methylated spirit, 4.8% chlorocylenol, and 2% dichlorocylenol. <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref> A study by Igizeneza <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> in 2020 revealed
that 4.8% chlorocylenol was highly efficient in eradicating <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> sp. and <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> sp.
strains by 100%. Guther's research in 2020, focusing on skin surfaces and hospital
environments, discovered that 4.8% chlorocylenol could inhibit the metabolic
activity of 38.9% of gram-positive bacteria and 60.7% of gram-negative bacteria.</p><p>Research on the effectiveness of ozone water (10 mg/L) as a disinfection agent on
diamond burs that have been contaminated by <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus
aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans</italic> and spores of <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus atrophaeus</italic> showed a reduction of microorganisms
by 90.15-99.33%. <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Research on the effectiveness of 4.8% chloroxylenol as a disinfecting agent
showed its ability to interfere with the metabolic activity of Gram-positive
bacteria at 38.9% concentration and Gram-negative at 60.7% concentration. <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>

</p><p>There are many disinfection agents that can be used in dentistry. Hypochlorous acid
(HOCl) was evaluated as an antimicrobial disinfectant for alginate impression
materials using a spraying technique. Research conducted by Bayan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> HOCl at a concentration of 200 ppm for 5 and 10
minutes was compared with a negative control (no treatment) and a positive control
using 0.5% sodium hypochlorite. Antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans,
Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed using colony forming
unit tests, alongside tests for dimensional stability and reproduction of details.
Results indicated that HOCl exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against all
tested microorganisms. Importantly, HOCl did not affect the dimensional stability of
the alginate impression material. Therefore, HOCl has the potential to be an
effective antimicrobial agent for alginate impression materials without compromising
their surface details or dimensional stability. <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>

</p><p>Sodium hypochlorite is one of the original and most widely used disinfectants,
effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including Human
Immunodeficiency Virus, viruses, fungi, bacterial species, and their spores. A study
conducted by Aseel M. Al-khafaji, Shorouq M. Abass, and Bayan S. Khalaf explored the
use of SOLO and sodium hypochlorite disinfectant solutions for the disinfection of
dental casts by spraying the stone specimen. This research aimed to assess the
surface hardness, dimensional accuracy, reproduction of details, and surface
porosity of type III, type IV, and type IV extra hard dental stone. The findings
revealed no significant differences in dimensional accuracy, reproduction of
details, surface hardness, and surface porosity among all types of tested stone
samples after immersion or spraying with SOLO and sodium hypochlorite, except for
type IV extra hard stone, which showed significant differences in surface hardness
after spraying with SOLO and in surface porosity after immersion in both SOLO and
sodium hypochlorite solutions. <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>Improper cleaning and maintenance of dentures can lead to contamination by various
microbial pathogens, contributing to oral health issues. In a study by Maha A.
Mahmood, Bayan S. Khalaf, and Shorouq M. Abass, HOCl was investigated to compare its
antimicrobial effectiveness with oxalic, tartaric, citric acids, and alkaline
peroxide, along with microwave irradiation, on the growth of Candida albicans and
Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Microwave irradiation was used to disinfect
specimens of heat-activated acrylic resin and soft liner material. Microwave
treatment or tartaric acid achieved sterilization of both heat-cured acrylic resin
and soft lining material contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus, while microwave
energy, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, and alkaline peroxide achieved complete
sterilization against Candida albicans. Microwave irradiation was found to be the
most effective method for sterilizing both heat-cured acrylic resin and soft lining
material contaminated with either Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans, with
tartaric acid ranking second. <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">

chloroxylenol. Ozone water is a strong alternative to disinfectants and effectively
kills pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and
endospores. <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref> Ozone is more effective against large numbers of microorganisms because of
its ability to oxidize microorganisms without causing resistance. Ozone can inhibit
the control of enzymes and therefore act on bacterial cell metabolism and damage
bacterial cell membranes. Ozone water disrupts the integrity of the bacterial cell
envelope through the oxidation of phospholipids and lipoproteins.</p><p>In this study, the concentration of ozone water used was 15 mg/L, with a soaking time
of 30 minutes. The use of ozone water as a material for disinfecting dental
instruments was recommended at a concentration of 10-20 mg/L. As reported by
previous research, a concentration of ozone water that is too low showed a reduction
in the antibacterial effectiveness of ozone water, while a concentration that is too
high and exposure for too long could cause toxicity. Ozone maintained its
antibacterial properties for the first 20 minutes, and after 30 minutes the
stability of ozone water slowly decreased. After eight hours, there was no more
ozone in the ozonized water.</p><p>Based on the data on the number of bacterial colonies in the treatment group with
ozone water samples, ozone water was more effective in disinfecting the mandibular
molar forceps. It was observed that four out of 10 mandibular molar extraction
forceps were successfully decontaminated, with six samples showing bacterial growth
with the highest number of bacteria being 11&#183;10 <sup>3</sup> CFU/mL. The
number of bacterial colonies in the treatment group with ozone water was the lowest
when compared to the other two treatment groups, with an average value of 4.00
&#177; 4.32. This is due to the greater efficiency of ozone water in killing
bacterial endospores by oxidizing and damaging the bacterial membrane which contains
lipoproteins and fatty acids, so that the bacteria experience failure in the
germination process.</p><p>In contrast, 4.8% chloroxylenol is unable to kill bacterial endospores, therefore
4.8% chloroxylenol is still classified as medium-level chemical disinfection. This
makes ozone water more effective in killing microorganisms when compared to 4.8%
chloroxylenol according to C&#233;sar <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012,
who stated that the antimicrobial activity of ozone water against <italic toggle="yes">B. atrophaeus</italic> spores resulted in a decrease in growth of
90.15% and 98.74% after 10 and 30 minutes of exposure to ozone water, respectively.
In this study, the average number of bacterial colonies in the ozone water treatment
group was lower due to the ability of the ozone water to kill bacterial endospores.
Endospora is very resistant to high temperatures, extreme environmental conditions,
or chemicals. The ability of ozone water to kill bacterial endospores was likely one
of the causes of the fewer bacterial colonies formed in the ozone water treatment
group. Data from C&#233;sar <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> also shows that
the use of ozonated water (10 mg/L) for 30 minutes was effective for disinfection of
diamond burs that have been contaminated by <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>,
<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">C.

</p><p>In the 4.8% chloroxylenol treatment group, there was bacterial growth in all
mandibular molar tooth extraction forceps with a lower value compared to ozone
water, but the number of bacterial colonies formed was less than the negative
control. The mean bacterial count value in the 4.8% chloroxylenol group was 16.00
&#177; 6.65, while for the negative control group, the value was 217.50 &#177;
39.24. The research by Xiang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> in 2018 showed
that 11 out of 18 mandibular molar tooth extraction forceps which were cleaned using
4.8% chloroxylenol did not form bacterial colonies, and seven mandibular molar tooth
extraction forceps had a maximum bacterial count of 812&#183;10 <sup>3</sup>
CFU/mL and the average number of bacterial colonies formed was 82.5. This is by the
results of this study: in all research samples bacterial colonies still formed
although with fewer bacterial colonies on average. <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020, who researched the skin and

that 4.8% chloroxylenol was effective in killing 100% isolates of <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> sp. and <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> sp. Thus, 4.8% chloroxylenol was able to kill pathogenic
microorganisms. Still, its effectiveness is lower when compared to ozone water. The
-OH hydroxyl group of the 4.8% chloroxylenol molecule binds to proteins in the
bacterial cell membrane to disrupt it, thereby allowing the contents of the
bacterial cell to leak. This allows 4.8% chloroxylenol to enter the bacterial cell
to bind more proteins and enzymes and deactivate cell functions. Meanwhile, the
negative control group (Aquadest) had a lethal effect on microorganisms because
distilled water is a neutral organic compound used as a pure solvent and does not
have antibacterial activity. <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>Differences in the number of bacterial colonies can also be caused by several
factors, one of which is the number of microorganisms and contaminants, the
condition of the patient&#8217;s oral cavity, the number and type of normal flora
in the oral cavity of each patient which can differ due to severe caries,
periodontal disease, pulpal necrosis or abscess at the time of tooth extraction.
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Disinfectants have different abilities and susceptibility depending on the
number and type of bacteria present in the patient&#8217;s oral cavity; the
duration of exposure and the concentration of the disinfecting agents also affect
the ability to kill microorganisms. <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> The decrease in the number of different bacterial colonies in each treatment
is also influenced by open environmental conditions, environmental temperature, and
humidity both during sampling and when processing samples in the laboratory, ozone

It compares the use of ozonated water
with the traditional treatment with&#160;chloroxylenol 4.8%. There are some points
that would have been interesting to explore further, such as a more thorough
screening of the genera of microorganisms that survive the different treatments. In
parts of the paper, the genus and species are not italicized. Methodologically, some
literature reports that the effect of ozone after 5 minutes is not effective,
contrary to what is reported here. Overall, the paper, despite its operational and
experimental simplicity, presents some interesting key points.</p><p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current

Effectiveness Against Bacterial Colonies on Dental Extraction Instruments at the USU
Dental and Oral Hospital&#8221; explores the effectiveness of ozone water and
chloroxylenol in inactivating bacteria on dental instruments.</p><p>
<bold>General comments</bold>
</p><p> While the topic is of considerable interest, the study suffers from several key
issues, particularly in the writing and methodology sections, which are presented in
an unstructured way. Moreover, the study's overall contribution to the existing
literature appears limited.</p><p> The sampling procedures are unclear, and the authors do not provide sufficient
detail on how they minimized the risk of bias in the allocation of instrument
samples. With only 10 samples, the study&#8217;s findings are not robust enough to
justify any broad generalizations.</p><p> Another major limitation is the lack of identification and/or isolation of
microorganisms, which would have allowed for a more standardized evaluation of
disinfectant performance against comparable inoculum sizes. Additionally, the
washing processes used prior to instrument handling, to remove blood and saliva,
could introduce bias especially given the small sample size.</p><p>
<bold>Specific comments</bold>
</p><p>
<bold>Title</bold>
</p><p> 1- It is not advisable to use abbreviations in the title. I suggest either writing
"USU" in full or omitting it entirely.</p><p>
<bold>Abstract</bold>
</p><p> 2 -The rationale for conducting the study is not clearly established. Please
elaborate further. For example, isn't the use of ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol
already a proven and standardized aseptic practice? If so, why is this study
necessary?</p><p> 3 -Additionally, the abbreviation "USU" appears in the abstract without being
explained.</p><p> 4 -&#8220;This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ozone water and 4.8%
chloroxylenol in reducing bacterial colonies on dental extraction instruments at the
USU Dental and Oral Hospital between October and December 2022.&#8221; Note: The
phrase "between October and December 2022" seems unnecessary here and can be
removed.</p><p> 5 -The methods section of the abstract should be written more formally, detailing
the sampling, transportation, treatment (including the form, application, and
exposure), and the plate inoculation process.</p><p> 6 -The study is based on only 10 different instruments. Why such a small sample
size? How representative is this sample?</p><p> 7 -The results are reported in a confusing manner. The p-value analysis is presented
before the colony count values. The authors present two values for the number of
colonies in the treatment group: 4.00 &#177; 4.32 and 16.00 &#177; 6.65. Which
value is correct? If the values refer to ozone water and chloroxylenol,
respectively, please specify this clearly.</p><p>
<bold>Introduction</bold>
</p><p> 8 -Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 contain redundant information. Please consider rewriting

</p><p> 11 - The sentence "The patient&#8217;s oral cavity state, the kind and quantity of

pre-treatment procedures." This information is also repeated in the "Disinfection
procedure" section.</p><p> 13 - Instead of simply stating that " The sampling technique used in this study was

process to ensure reproducibility by other researchers.</p><p> 14 - The subsections &#8220;Disinfection procedure&#8221; and &#8220;Taking the

</p><p> 2 -The rationale for conducting the study is not clearly established. Please
elaborate further. For example, isn't the use of ozone water and 4.8%
chloroxylenol already a proven and standardized aseptic practice? If so, why is
this study necessary? <bold>answer</bold> :&#160; Research on ozone water as a
disinfectant is still limited and no research has been found on the use of ozone
water on tooth extraction instruments. However, ozone has antibacterial
properties so researchers are interested in studying the effectiveness of ozone
water as a disinfectant when compared to the commonly used 4.8%
chloroxylenol</p><p> 3 - "USU" appears in the abstract without being explained.</p><p> 4 -The phrase "between October and December 2022" seems unnecessary here and can
