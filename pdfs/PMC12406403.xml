Among all types of lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma is the most frequently occurring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In recent years, immune checkpoint blockades (ICIs) therapy has achieved significant efficacy in various tumor treatments, including lung adenocarcinoma. Targeted PD-1/PD-L1 therapies are currently widely used for immune checkpoint blockade therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The use of PD-L1 blockade therapies has become widespread in the treatment of various types of cancer, including lung adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The combination of PD-L1 blockade therapies with the chemotherapeutic agent carboplatin has demonstrated remarkable benefits in terms of both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with advanced stage III-IV NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, it is worth noting that only a subset of patients, accounting for less than 40% of cases, actual response positively to PD-L1 blockade therapies and experience prolonged PFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The overall objective response rate for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapies is 13&#8211;80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This indicates that there might be additional factors contribute to immune evasion of tumor cells. Therefore, it is imperative to identify and understand these underlying mechanisms to develop effective strategies against tumor immune escape.</p><p id="Par6">PD-L1 expression of tumor cells is one of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved biomarkers for predicting PD-L1/PD-1 blockade therapies response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Accumulating studies have shown that interfering with PD-L1 expression can impact tumor immunogenicity. For instance, miR-105-5p could reduce PD-L1 expression and increase the immunogenicity of gastric cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Elizabeth A. et al. certificated that the loss of PTEN upregulated PD-L1 expression and decreased the immunogenicity of triple negative breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Other research also found that lncRNA SNHG12 promoted immune escape by increasing the expression of PD-L1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There are also numerous studies on the relationship between KRAS mutation, PD-L1 expression, and immune escape. Numerous evidence supporting the correlation between KRAS mutation and increased level of PD-L1 in various tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], containing NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Moreover, research has found that the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in patients with KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma is comparable to that of patients with KRAS-wild type lung adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, patients with KRAS mutation in lung adenocarcinoma are prone to immune evasion, leading to resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which indicates that KRAS mutation may be related to PD-L1 mediated immune escape. It has been discovered that KRAS mutation can stimulate the expression of PD-L1 by activating the MEK-dependent oncogenic transcription factor FRA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Meanwhile, some studies have also revealed that KRAS mutation promoted PD-L1 expression through the MER/ERK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, our previous research found that two new genes, SLC7A5 and ZNF24, are regulated by the KRAS mutation and located backward position of the MEK/ERK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, it is still unclear whether ZNF24 and SLC7A5 are involved in regulating PD-L1 expression and how they participate in immune escape. Clarifying this issue is crucial for revealing the mechanism by which KRAS mutation leads to immune escape.</p><p id="Par7">In this research, we found for the first time that KRAS mutation regulate PD-L1 expression and affect CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity through the ZNF24/SLC7A5 axis, leading to immune escape. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the potential role of KRAS/ZNF24/SLC7A5 axis as a therapeutic target for improving immunotherapy outcomes in Ras-driven tumors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cells and tissues</title><p id="Par8">The lung adenocarcinoma cell lines of human, including Calu-3, H358, H23 and H2122, were obtained from Center for Molecular and Cellular Sciences of Shanghai. The Lewis lung cancer cell line derived from mice, LLC, was obtained from FengHuiShengWu in Hunan, China. These cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 or DMEM medium which were purchased from VivaCell in Shanghai, China. Additionally, the culture media were supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution from Beyotime in Shanghai and 10% fetal bovine serum from VivaCell. All the cells mentioned above were cultured in a controlled environment at 37&#8451; with an atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. From 2013 to 2023, a total of fifty-five lung adenocarcinoma tissues and twenty normal lung epithelial tissues were collected from individuals who were undergoing lung cancer resection at our hospital (the 920th Hospital of the Joint Logistics Support Force of PLA). The selection criteria for inclusion in the study required a confirmed diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma through pathology examination and a clear determination of the KRAS status through genetic testing. The entire process of sample collection was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines set forth by the ethics committee of our hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Transfection</title><p id="Par9">The lentivirus carrying ZNF24 gene knockdown constructs were transfected into the cells. The lentivirus and plasmid were acquired from Genechem, a biotechnology company located in Shanghai, China. The cells were initially cultured in a 6-well plate at a density of 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>4</sup> cells. Then, the lentivirus carrying the gene knockdown constructs (at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and a volume of 2 mL) was added to the cells. After 6&#8211;8&#160;h, the RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum was replaced, and the cells were further cultivated for 48&#160;h. To select for cells that underwent successful gene knockdown, the researchers used RPMI 1640 medium containing 2&#160;mg/mL purinomycin for a period of 3&#8211;5 days. This allowed for the elimination of cells that did not exhibit stable ZNF24 expression decrease. Additionally, the researchers were also interested in studying the overexpression of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and SLC7A5 genes. To achieve this, the over-SLC7A5 or over-KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> plasmids were transfected into the cells using the Lipofectamine 3000 kit, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Screening and validation of ZNF24 inhibitors</title><p id="Par10">Molecular docking is a virtual screening of the compound database based on various scoring functions, and the strongest compounds that can bind to target proteins can be predicted. Accelrys Discovery Studio 3.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], Pymol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and Autodock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] were used for docking. The crystal structure of ZNF24 was mainly screened from the protein database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org">www.pdb.org</ext-link>), and human protein and prioritizing the protein crystal structure with higher resolution were selected and prioritized from the database. Then, the Pymol software was used to optimize the crystal structure of ZNF24 protein, remove water molecules and ligand molecules and add hydrogenation and charges to obtain a ZNF24 protein structure that is close to the activity in the organism. In this study, the LibDock tool of Discovery Studio (DS) was used to specify the number of conformations and docked them through &#8216;&#8217;High Quality&#8217;&#8217;. LibDock was a high-throughput docking algorithm used to locate the formation of protein active site based on polar interaction sites (hot spots) in ligands generated by catalysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The conformational space of ligands was recognized by AutoDock using the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LGA). Both receptors and ligands were used in MOL2 format. Virtual screening of small molecules was completed in this study from small molecule databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.apexbt.com/search/screening-library?cat=778">https://www.apexbt.com/search/screening-library?cat=778</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par11">Next, to demonstrate the affinity between small molecule compounds and target protein ZNF24 through Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Firstly, the ZNF24 gene was inserted into the prokaryotic expression plasmid pET-28a (+) (Qingke, China). The expression plasmids of ZNF24 were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and screened with 50&#160;&#181;g/ml kanamycin. After PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis identification, a single positive colony was inoculated into 100 mL of LB medium and grown at 37&#160;&#176;C. The protein was expressed inducibly with Auto-induction Medium for 6&#160;h at 37&#160;&#176;C and overnight at 30 &#8451;, 200&#160;rpm. E. coli BL21 (DE3) was collected by centrifugation at 12,000&#160;rpm for 20&#160;min and ultrasonicated. The supernatant contained soluble protein, and the precipitate contained inclusion body protein. The inclusion body protein was collected by bacterial sonication in a bacterial lysis buffer. The dissolved inclusion body proteins were purified with the HisPur Ni-NTA Purification Kit (88,229, Thermo, Germany). 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and WB were used to detect the expression of target proteins. The ZNF24 protein was diluted to 50 &#181; g/mL with a fixed reagent (10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0). Firstly, the surface of the CM5 chip is coated with 400 mM 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and 100 mM N-Hydroxy succinimide (NHS) at a flow rate of 10 &#181; L/min for 420&#160;s. Secondly, the ZNF24 protein (50&#160;&#181;g/mL) was added to the experimental channel (Fc2) for flow rate of 10 &#181; L/min with a fixed amount of approximately 10,000 RU. Finally, the chip was loaded with 1&#160;M ethanolamine at a rate of 10 &#181; L/min was blocked for 420&#160;s. The reference channel (Fc1) was not injected with ZNF24 protein and other operations were the same as the experimental channel. Daptomycin was diluted 20 times with a dilution reagent to reduce the DMSO content from 100 to 5%. Daptomycin was injected into the experimental and reference channels at a rate of 30 &#181; L/min with appropriate time for binding and dissociation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p id="Par12">The association between the mutation status of the KRAS gene and the infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was examined using the TIMER database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/">https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Specifically, it included a total of 164 cases of lung adenocarcinoma tissues with KRAS mutation and 351 cases of lung adenocarcinoma tissues with wild-type KRAS. In addition, the relationship between the expression of PD-L1 and the infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was also predicted using the TIMER database.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Immunohistochemical (IHC)</title><p id="Par13">Initially, the sections were incubated at a relatively high temperature of 68&#8451; for a duration of 2&#160;h. Following this, the sections underwent dewaxing using xylene, anhydrous ethanol, a gradient ethanol series, and distilled water. To create a suitable environment for further analysis, the sections were then boiled in an acid buffer with a pH of 6.0 under high temperature and pressure for a duration of 2&#160;min. After ensuring optimal conditions for analysis, the endogenous peroxidase activity in the tissue sections was blocked using a 0.3% hydrogen peroxide solution. To specifically evaluate the expression levels of PD-L1, ZNF24, and SLC7A5 proteins, the tissue sections were first incubated with a normal goat serum containing 5% concentration for 25&#8211;30&#160;min.

</p><p id="Par27">Then, to verify the hypothesis that KRAS mutation is responsible for regulating the expression of PD-L1 in lung adenocarcinoma through the ZNF24/SLC7A5 axis, a series of experiments were conducted. Initially, two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (H358 and H2122) known to carry the KRAS mutation were selected. To investigate the role of ZNF24 in this process, ZNF24 knockdown cell lines were generated using shRNA-ZNF24. WB and RT-qPCR techniques were utilized to analyze the levels of ZNF24, SLC7A5, and PD-L1. We found that in the ZNF24 knockdown cell lines, the levels of PD-L1 were significantly decreased (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A-F). To further validate the involvement of the ZNF24/SLC7A5 axis in the regulation of PD-L1 expression, an overexpression plasmid containing SLC7A5 was introduced into the ZNF24 knockdown cell lines.

However, there are currently no drugs available that specifically target ZNF24. To address this, we decided to use computer simulation technology to identify a small molecule inhibitor of ZNF24. Molecular docking, a commonly used computational tool, was employed in this study to predict the most stable conformation of the ligand within the active site of a specific target molecule by calculating the Gibbs free energy. To start the research process, we first conducted a screening of the PDB database to identify the crystal structure of ZNF24. Once we had this information, we proceeded to gather all the compounds of the ligand dataset that would be suitable for docking with the ZNF24 receptor. The purpose of this step was to identify potential compounds that could interact with the ZNF24 receptor. After the docking process, we obtained valuable data on the binding energies and the highest LibDock score for each of the docked ligands. Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents a comprehensive overview of these scores, which serve as indicators of the inhibitory ability of the compounds against the protein. A higher LibDock score suggests a stronger inhibitory effect. Based on this information, we selected the compound with the highest LibDock score for further analysis. In this case, the compound that displayed the highest inhibitory potential was Daptomycin (DAPT). We then proceeded to perform docking simulations and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) experiments using DAPT and ZNF24. Autodock, a popular software tool, was employed for the docking simulation process, which involved visualizing the interaction between DAPT and ZNF24. The successful docking of the two molecules was depicted in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A.

Mono-clone was selected for bacterial liquid PCR, and agarose gel electrophoresis was performed to confirm the size of the PCR product in the bacterial solution.

Firstly, the concentration gradient of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells designed to co-culture with tumor cells to estimate the lethality of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (1:3, 1:5 and 1:10), and the LDH experiment results showed that 1:5 was the optimal ratio (sFig&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). So, 1:5 was used as the optimal concentration for co-culture. Next, different methods were used to inhibit the expression of KRAS or ZNF24 of tumor cells co-cultured with the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

The excessive necrosis indicates rapid growth of tumor cells and ischemic necrosis of tumor cells. The excessive necrosis is often associated with tumor hypoxia and acidosis, possibly by recruiting myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) to form an immunosuppressive microenvironment. The morphological characteristics of focal necrosis suggest that it may be related to immune activation. Similar research reports suggest that this type of necrosis may be driven by necroptosis, by releasing DAMPs molecules such as HMGB1 and ATP, recruiting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and dendritic cells, and transforming cold tumors into immune infiltrating hot tumors.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par42">In previous research, we have identified ZNF24 and SLC7A5 as key players in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma with KRAS mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Yet, whether they are involved in immune escape in lung adenocarcinoma with KRAS mutation are still unclear. Through this study, we have provided evidence that KRAS mutation contributes to the immune escape of lung adenocarcinoma via the two newly implicated genes. Mechanistically, our data suggest that KRAS mutation increased PD-L1 levels through the ZNF24/SLC7A5 pathway, thereby inhibiting the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Additionally, we employed computer simulations to identify small molecule inhibitors specifically targeting ZNF24. The inhibitor held the potential to selectively interfere with the activity of ZNF24 and enhance the activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells against KRAS-mutant tumor cells, offering a novel therapeutic approach in combination with immunotherapy for KRAS mutant tumors. Significantly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report identifying this specific signaling pathway as a crucial regulator of immune escape mediated by PD-L1 levels in lung adenocarcinoma.</p><p id="Par43">First identified in 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], ZNF24 has since been recognized as a crucial regulator of organ development. Disruptions of ZNF24 in experimental models result in early mortality at varying developmental stages, underlining its importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, recent studies have revealed diverse roles for ZNF24 as a transcription factor across different cancer types. In liver cancer, ZNF24 reportedly binds directly to the CTNNB1 promoter, activating &#946;-catenin cyclin D1 expression and subsequently promoting liver cancer cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In prostate cancer, upregulated ZNF24 has been associated with the facilitation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via Twist1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Conversely, microRNA-940 has been observed to inhibit ZNF24 expression in gastric cancer, correlating with enhanced malignant cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Our earlier work demonstrated that ZNF24 promotes tumor progression by enhancing the translation of SLC7A5 in lung adenocarcinoma-carrying KRAS mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Expanding on these findings, the present investigation pioneers the discovery of ZNF24&#8217;s capability to augment PD-L1 expression, thereby enabling an immune-evasive environment within the tumor.</p><p id="Par44">PD-L1 is expressed on the surface of tumor cells and stromal immune cells, allowing tumors to evade the cytotoxic effects of infiltrating T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Although numerous studies have demonstrated high PD-L1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer with KRAS mutations, the specific molecular mechanisms by which KRAS mutations regulate PD-L1 expression remain unclear. This study confirmed through extensive experiments that KRAS mutation induces PD-L1 expression through ZNF24/SLC7A5 in lung adenocarcinoma (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In recent years, studies have shown that [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] SLC7A5 and PD-L1 are highly expressed and positively correlated in breast cancer, which is consistent with the results of this study. In addition, previous studies have shown that KRAS mutation mainly regulate PD-L1 expression through the MEK-ERK pathway in non-small cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Our previous studies have demonstrated that ZNF24 and SLC7A5 are located downstream of the KRAS-MEK-ERK pathway. Therefore, our research results further elucidate the specific mechanism by which the KRAS-MEK-ERK pathway regulates PD-L1 expression, and for the first time, identify the regulatory relationship between the KRAS-MEK-ERK-ZNF24-SLC7A5-PD-L1 signaling axis. But there is one study worth noting, which suggests that high expression of PD-L1 in KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer is caused by smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Regarding this research finding, possible explanations could be attributed to poor specificity and sensitivity of the immunohistochemical antibody used for detecting PD-L1 expression eight years ago, or it could be due to a small sample size leading to errors.</p><p id="Par45">CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells play a critical role in anti-tumor immune response. An abundance of evidence underscores the role of CD8<sup>+</sup> tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as indicators of an anti-tumor immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A negative correlation was observed between PD-L1 expression and the number of infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in lung adenocarcinoma through bioinformatics analysis. Our also demonstrated that inhibiting KRAS/ZNF24/SLC7A5 axis encourages the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by downregulating PD-L1 level in vitro experiments. Miliotis C al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] also found that the expression of PD-L1 inhibited the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In vivo evaluation using immune-functional C57BL/6 mice echoed the in vitro conclusions. It is well-documented that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, a type of immune cell, can become exhausted following incessant stimulation by chronic inflammation or tumor antigens. This exhaustion manifests as diminished proliferative capacity, increased apoptotic propensity, and compromised ability to secrete effector cytokines (IL-2, IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945;), all of which compromise their immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In this study, ELISA experiments demonstrated that inhibiting KRAS/ZNF24/SLC7A5 axis could increase the level of IL-2, IFN-&#947;, and TNF-&#945; in the co-cultured supernatants (sFig&#160;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>&#160;C).</p><p id="Par46">SLC7A5, an amino acid transporter protein, has been associated with aberrant nutritional metabolism and exhibits elevated expression in cancerous tissue compared to normal tissue. This heightened expression has been positively correlated with tumoral growth and proliferation, rendering SLC7A5 an independent prognostic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In addition, SLC7A5 has been found to facilitate tumor cells in sequestering nutrients from the microenvironment, thus endowing them with enhanced growth and proliferation capabilities. At the same time, the accelerated growth and exceptional nutrient uptake of tumor cells transform the tumor microenvironment into an acidic, hypoxic, and nutrient-deficient area. This transformation impairs CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that also rely on these environmental nutrients, thereby disabling their tumor cell-killing ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Our research further noted elevated SLC7A5 expression in lung adenocarcinoma with KRAS mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Overexpression of SLC7A5 inhibits CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, leading to their inactivation. Therefore, the heightened SLC7A5 expression in lung adenocarcinoma with KRAS mutation may contribute to the reduction of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and aid tumor cells in monopolizing amino acids, culminating in tumor cell immune evasion. Nevertheless, the role of SLC7A5 in the immune escape of lung adenocarcinoma with KRAS mutation necessitates further experimental clarification. Concurrently, other research has shown that the cytotoxic ability of exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is weakened or lost, and this condition is associated with elevated expression of inhibitory molecules such as PD-1, TIM3, LAG3, and CTLA4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Our results substantiate that the inhibition of the KRAS/ZNF24/SCL7A5 axis decreases the number of CD8<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> T cells (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>H and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) and heightens the tumor cell-killing capability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A, B). Substantially, this study unveils that inhibiting the KRAS/ZNF24/SLC7A5 axis could augment the number of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by diminishing PD-L1 expression. However, the synergistic effects of KRAS/ZNF24/SLC7A5 axis inhibition and PD-L1 blockade warrant further investigation to ascertain whether the former increases the sensitivity to immunotherapy. We utilized computer simulation to screen the small molecule inhibitor DAPT targeting ZNF24. Our results confirmed that DAPT could inhibit the immune escape of lung adenocarcinoma with KRAS mutation by decreasing PD-L1 expression (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This open-up the possibility of improving the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients with KRAS mutation through administering DAPT or RGD-KGH-R1-scFv in conjunction with immunotherapy in the future. However, validating this proposition necessitates further clinical trials to establish efficacy. While this study has validated one small molecule inhibitor of ZNF24, it is essential to conduct additional comparative studies on ZNF24&#8217;s small molecule inhibitors. The extensive use of ZNF24 small molecule inhibitors still requires identification of their toxicity and effectiveness. Such investigations will enable the selection of an inhibitor exhibiting the most potent inhibitory effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par47">In conclusion, our findings illustrate that KRAS mutation instigates tumor immune evasion by obstructing the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells through the ZNF24/SLC7A5/PD-L1 axis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Additionally, our study uncovers the potential therapeutic utility of ZNF24 inhibitors, such as DAPT, in mitigating immune escape in lung adenocarcinoma with KRAS mutation. A synergistic approach combining ZNF24 inhibitors with immunotherapy may present a novel therapeutic strategy for RAS-driven tumors.</p><p id="Par48">
<fig id="Fig8" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of the mechanism in KRAS mutation promoted immune escape of lung adenocarcinoma via ZNF24/SLC7A5/PD-L1 axis. KRAS mutation upregulated PD-L1 expression through the MEK/ERK/ZNF24/SLC7A5 pathway. ZNF24 could upregulate the level of PD-L1 through SLC7A5. ZNF24 and SLC7A5 promoted PD-L1 expression in the form of protein complexes. DAPT and RGD-KGH-R1-scFv reduced PD-L1 expression induced by KRAS mutation and reprogram immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to enhance CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity through inhibiting ZNF24 or KRAS respectively</p></caption><graphic id="d33e1338" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="12885_2025_14336_Fig8_HTML.jpg"/></fig>
