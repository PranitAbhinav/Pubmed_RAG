This study aimed to understand the role of health communication on how people perceived the risk of COVID-19 and influenced relevant health behaviours to minimise disease susceptibility during the COVID-19 pandemic among people with a chronic disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>This qualitative study involved a semi-structured interview of participants diagnosed with a chronic disease. In analysing interview responses, the Health Belief Model was utilised as a sensitising framework to facilitate analysis and explore themes within the domains of the model.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>Interviews were completed between August and December 2020 through online platforms with individual participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were Australian residents aged &#8805;18 years with self-reported chronic disease(s). Ninety interviews were completed, and a sample of 33 participants were enrolled for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Two main themes were identified: cues to action and perception of the threat of infection. Many participants had implemented external cues to preventative behaviours, including, but not limited to, social distancing, hand hygiene and, in some cases, mask use, mirroring enforced government restrictions. Individuals also had several social motivators from family, particularly those working in the health field, and the wider community to employ the enforced preventative behaviours. However, despite having a chronic disease, many participants did not recognise themselves as being susceptible to COVID-19. Rather, they were more concerned for others that they characterised as being at high risk, including the elderly. Geographical location also played a role in risk prevention behaviour; owing to low case numbers in rural and remote areas, the risk of susceptibility was not perceived to be high.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings demonstrate the need to clearly communicate the risk of infection to allow individuals to make informed decisions on preventative behaviours. This has ongoing relevance to future emergencies, including future pandemics/epidemics, and highlights the greater challenge if similar public health measures are contemplated again.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Chronic Disease</kwd><kwd>Risk Assessment</kwd><kwd>Health policy</kwd><kwd>PUBLIC HEALTH</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>The sample size of 33 participants is quite large for qualitative interviews as part of this qualitative study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participants represented a broad group of chronic diseases including, but not limited, to cancer, mental illness, diabetes, musculoskeletal and autoimmune disorders.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participant selection relied on self-reporting of chronic diseases, which was a limitation because some patients did not specify their chronic disease adequately (or not at all), potentially misinterpreting the experience of some participants.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p> During an emergency event, health communication influences health decisions and has been particularly important in the conceptualisation of risk, allowing individuals and communities to make informed health decisions about a disease.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 2</sup></xref> Communication of risk through public health advice has been critical during the COVID-19 pandemic to encourage appropriate management of risks of infection and transmission and protect the broader community.

Participants of the parental cross-sectional survey were Australian residents aged &#8805;18 years, who were asked to self-report any chronic diseases during data collection.

During the interview period, restrictions were eased in some of the Australian states and territories, except for Victoria where the case numbers were increasing and restrictions were implemented. However, an international travel ban remained across Australia (8). Interview questions related to topics explored during the initial survey included social distancing, government guidelines, hygiene, personal experiences living under lockdown and pandemic. Interviews were completed in approximately 20&#8211;40&#8201;min, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A copy of the interview guide is provided in <xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 2</xref>.</p><p>After each interview session, recordings were saved using unique identifiers in the shared research repository, along with notes from the research member conducting the interview. The research team participated in informal debriefings, allowing them to reflect on the interviews. Reflections focused on the information gained from participant responses, including an individual&#8217;s perception of risk, preventative behaviours taken, thoughts on preventative behavioural guidelines and any other effects on individuals and their families. Interviewer bias and probing depth during interviews were also discussed as part of a reflexive approach.</p><p>Subsequent filtering of participants to identify those with an identifiable chronic disease of interest led to the transcription of interviews for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Interview questions focused on the aim of the study, with participant responses identifying people&#8217;s perceptions of health communication and COVID-19-related risk, which emerged as an area of interest for further subsequent data analysis and coding.</p><p>The HBM framework was used for identifying and examining perceived risk of infection, transmission of COVID-19 and preventative health behaviours. Formulated as a model for the adoption of health prevention behaviours, the HBM suggests that ideal behavioural change will be achieved when considerations and targeting account for perceived benefits, barriers, self-efficacy and threat.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4 29</sup></xref> Therefore, the HBM was used as a sensitising framework to facilitate a comparison within and across semi-structured interviews and investigate themes within cues to action, severity and susceptibility HBM domains. Viewing the HBM, cues to action were considered a predictor variable of individuals&#8217; perception of risk derived from susceptibility and severity.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5 29</sup></xref></p><p>Data analysis for qualitative interviews was guided by abductive reasoning. Being a pragmatist qualitative approach, abductive reasoning involves an iterative process of identifying key emerging concepts from the data and developing and extending theory in an iterative and recursive process by engaging with established theories, such as the HBM.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30 31</sup></xref> In this approach, themes were first identified, grouped and coded around the domains of the HBM before each domain was inductively coded to identify novel and recurrent patterns that highlighted the experiences of participants during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Responses given during semi-structured interviews were coded in two rounds: first, two researchers (MB and MM) independently coded four interviews using the HBM domains, with these interviews independently cross-coded by a further two researchers (FR and LT). The research team then collaboratively discussed initial codes, consistency among coders and definition of HBM domains to be used when coding the entire data set. Once consistency and definitions were established, two researchers (MB and MM) inductively coded the remaining interview transcripts, meeting with the whole team frequently to discuss consistency, domain fit and any emerging themes. Transcriptions of semi-structured interviews were uploaded to QSR NVivo for Windows, version 12 (QSR International), to supplement the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>None.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Findings</title><p>A total of 33 participants met the eligibility requirements.

Other HBM constructs such as perceived benefits, barriers and self-efficacy were not predominant in the data.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cues to action</title><p>Cues to action can be both internal and external cues or triggers to engage in health-promoting behaviours. External cues are important in health communication during a health emergency such as COVID-19. In this study, external cues to action are related to information from government, close family or contacts, media, religion, information from previous infection waves and geographical proximity to COVID-19 hot spot areas. Although many participants had appreciated government-led preventative health and restrictions and felt that they were easy to adapt to, they also perceived a general lack of understanding around the restrictions. As outlined by individuals, these included confusion surrounding government recommendations on COVID-19 restrictions, often due to the sudden implementation of changes or differences between geographical locations and overseas. In many cases, despite being protective, participants were not able to understand the restrictions being implemented or did not consider the preventative behaviour beneficial in reducing their perceived risk of COVID-19.</p><disp-quote><p>When you look at the overall stats there&#8217;s only sort of not that many of the population that are getting extremely sick with it &#8230; so I don&#8217;t know how you work out, who can go where and do whatever they want and who can&#8217;t &#8230; It&#8217;s a bit confusing why we&#8217;re now wearing masks everywhere where we weren&#8217;t wearing masks before when it first started up, but now they&#8217;re saying, telling everyone to wear a mask everywhere, and now, we&#8217;re having to wear masks at work, whereas when it first came around, was really coming out, and we actually had cases in X, we don&#8217;t have any cases at the moment, but we didn&#8217;t have to wear masks all the time; then, only if we looked after someone that was showing symptoms, so that&#8217;s a bit confusing, too. I think that and like I&#8217;m working in the healthcare industry, so I guess other people &#8230; that are just lay people &#8230; must be really confused. Participant 88_Female_40-49</p></disp-quote><p>Several participants noted cues to action from government, media, etc., failed to generate a sense of urgency or susceptibility in the absence of geographical proximity to a COVID-19 hot spot. This means that those with a higher risk of infection may not have implemented preventative health behaviours earlier or became complacent as time progressed. This was acknowledged to have shifted in some geographical locations, often stimulated by local case numbers and updated information, highlighting a lack of local relevance in health messaging.</p><disp-quote><p>If anything, they could have been a little bit stronger here in the beginning because we are so isolated and didn&#8217;t have any confirmed cases within, you know, eighty K&#8217;s (kilometres) of us or something, people &#8230; didn&#8217;t take it as seriously as they maybe could have, especially people who consider themselves to be low risk, &#8216;coz in the beginning it was. The information coming out was more for like young people weren&#8217;t affected, and young children were not going to be affected and seems that information has changed as more data has come to light. So, I think there&#8217;re a lot of people who didn&#8217;t take it very seriously in the beginning, but as it&#8217;s gone on, I think people are taking it seriously; although I think you can only remain on high alert for so long, that people get disaster fatigue, and they sort of, if they don&#8217;t see the consequences, it&#8217;s difficult to be prepared for consequences that your not seeing, so I think that yeah people took the foot off the gas a little bit in the last month or so then they had those umm scares, and people have become more serious again. Participant 50_Female_30-39</p></disp-quote><p>Participants also noted the differences in restrictions between different states and territories, for example, in the enforcement of wearing face masks, whereby these types of enforcements and reported case numbers put participants at ease, believing it lowered their risk of COVID-19.</p><disp-quote><p>Just listening to people &#8230; there&#8217;s been restrictions regarding the number of people who can gather at the same time. I think it&#8217;s 10 now; some people are saying, &#8220;ohhh we can only have 10 people here.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;no, no, no, that&#8217;s in Greater X [location]. You know we are not in X [location]. Fine, I mean, it&#8217;s good we&#8217;re only having 10 people, that&#8217;s great that their thinking less rather than more; however, there just seems to be a bit of confusion that way. Participant 71_Female_50-59</p></disp-quote><p>How cues to action influenced participant decisions on/conclusions about behaviours was observed through participant implementation of preventative health behaviours. Often, this meant increasing hygiene practices, such as increased frequency of hand washing/sanitisation, as well as extended to a greater awareness for physical distancing and reduction in frequency to exposures to environments that participants deemed to be high risk predominantly, including supermarkets, travel (eg, air flights) and restaurants.</p><disp-quote><p>So, we&#8217;ve just sort of following the guidelines in general plus taking on a few things like, we&#8217;re not taking any internal flights, because I don&#8217;t believe the airlines are doing appropriate social distancing. We carry hand sanitiser with us. We have always had a good hand washing policy anyway but always have the hand sanitiser. We have it in vehicles. My partner carries it in his purse; I&#8217;ve got it on a belt loop. We&#8217;ve very much been keeping as much distance as we can when we are out and about. We try and focus our excursions, so if we are going out, we try and &#8230; we make sure to &#8230; as much as possible. We pick shopping times that are likely to be quieter, sanitising communal equipment that might be used. One of the biggest impacts was not shaking hands. Country people do it all the time, and its just that automatic reaction when you meet someone, you just stick your hand out to shake hands. Just those minor changes. Yeah, so I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve been significantly impacted. We just follow some simple guidelines, so, yeah, we&#8217;ve been quite fortunate out here. We still do go out and eat, but we try and pick outdoor menus where we can sit outdoor safer, gatherings always outdoors. Exercise is limited to just the two of us; if we have family or friends visiting, we use social distancing. Yeah, they are the main things that&#8217;s become the new normal for us really. Participant 39_Male_4o-49</p></disp-quote><p>Communication of risks to inform the population of the severity and susceptibility of their health, but also in communicating restrictions and preventative health behaviours, was evident at the time of this study. Many participants found information circulated by the media to be unclear and difficult to navigate and reported difficulty obtaining accurate information because of its rapidly changing nature. Further difficulties were observed in the communication methods for different restrictions between states or between countries, resulting in a sense of confusion and information overload. In many cases, this took a toll on mental health and well-being and spread fear among communities, resulting in panic buying of staple food supplies and protests over lockdowns.</p><disp-quote><p>I think someone that age is more isolated as far as information goes &#8230; so there were text messages that went around. She [participant&#8217;s grandmother] got text messages about your, that were confusing, as she&#8217;s not keen on text messages, and she saw the TV, but it seemed like it was a faraway problem, she only watches one six o&#8217;clock news, whereas for me, I have a smart phone. I have Facebook, and I get courier mail updates, like as students, we get subscription to the newspapers, and I just followed what was put in place pretty closely. I think that, yeah, maybe, there was a gap in how much information she was getting and then how much she was comprehending because a lot of the information that was coming out early was, I don&#8217;t know, whether they were trying not to alarm people, or what was coming out as like, &#8220;oh it&#8217;s the flu&#8221;, and then some of the information was extremely technical, which went over a lot of people&#8217;s heads, but then some of the information was like to &#8230; dumbed down that it didn&#8217;t seem to &#8230; like emphasise the gravity of the situation, and I think she might of got stuck, yeah, where she didn&#8217;t understand the sciency, technical. This is the virus, and this is how they replicate information, so she mostly paid attention to the more easy-kind-of-understand information, but that information was maybe a bit weak in its message especially. Participant 50_Female_30-39</p></disp-quote></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Perception of threat of infection</title><p>An individual&#8217;s perceived threat of infection refers to an individual&#8217;s perceived severity and susceptibility to infection and transmission of COVID-19. Several demographic factors were identified by participants as increasing their risk to contracting COVID-19, including the participants&#8217; chronic disease and age. Interestingly, many participants did not link their chronic disease with having increased risk, with many believing they were undertaking the appropriate preventative behaviours. Rather, participants were more concerned for others who they perceived to have a higher severity and susceptibility if infected, particularly the consequences if they were to transmit COVID-19 to them or the consequences of them becoming infected.</p><disp-quote><p>I probably should have been, but I sort of didn&#8217;t because I tend to look after myself health wise, but it was, actually, one day, actually one of my colleagues who said, &#8220;you know, you probably should be more careful because you&#8217;re Aboriginal, have heart issues,&#8221; and I&#8217;m 60 this year, so yeah, I probably am at risk, but I thought as long as I&#8217;m mindful to be doing all the right things and avoiding contact with anybody. Participant 67_Female_50-59</p></disp-quote><p>Susceptibility to infection heavily influenced their level of fear and anxiety about the unknown nature of the disease. This fear and anxiety were linked with infection waves, and individuals expressed more fear and anxiety when high case numbers were reported in their community, and their perceived susceptibility was higher.</p><disp-quote><p>I probably am a bit of a catastrophizer anyway &#8230; so the fear of getting it, and the fear of either, I think the initial fear was I would get it, and I would die. I think that moved onto &#8722; I would get it; I wouldn&#8217;t die, but I&#8217;d end up with this long covid sort of issues that people seem to be getting &#8230; or that I would have it and not know and then give it to someone that I loved that would then die, so I guess they were the things that scared me, yeah, in general terms. And I suppose specifically it got; it gets to the point where I feel scared about going to the supermarket or going to a caf&#233; or &#8230; things like that, so it modified my behaviours a lot because of that fear I suppose. Participant 46_Female_40-49</p></disp-quote><p>Limited case numbers or &#8216;hotspots&#8217; in rural locations were also a factor highlighted by some participants in considering their susceptibility. Many participants were grateful to be living in a geographical area where they believed the risk of COVID-19 was low, which lessened their perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 and its transmission.</p><disp-quote><p>We do have, you know, quite a closed boarder that kind of thing, and we are rural remote. So, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re necessarily worried about catching it ourselves &#8230; And I don&#8217;t know, probably just seeing the complacency of everybody else is stressful. Participant 6_Female_30-39</p></disp-quote><p>In assessing severity, participants also looked at hospital resources available to them, with most people feeling confident their hospital services could provide them and their community with appropriate care if they get COVID-19. However, participants who were hospital employees voiced different concerns; many of these participants identified their communities as being at high risk of possible COVID-19 due to community demographics, including age and, in some cases, having limited resources available to them in the form of personal protective equipment and ventilators if there was an outbreak. In one particular case, provision of resources was justified as not having any local COVID-19 cases; therefore, resources were diverted elsewhere.</p><disp-quote><p>My community is a very vulnerable community, in age, at least 60% were over 60 years of age. We&#8217;re also very remote and limited with, with resources, we have one ventilator that covers a good three hundred, five hundred K&#8217;s (kilometres) distance, so it was a stress trying to arrange that. Participant 47_Female_30-39</p></disp-quote><p>Participants also drew on experiences from previous infections in assessing severity and susceptibility, with many making the comparison between influenza, other infectious diseases and COVID-19 in assessing the severity of infection. By this comparison, some individuals thought the current pandemic was mild and, like other infectious diseases, would eventually pass, whereas others were more optimistic, feeling that the community had avoided a potentially deadly event.</p><disp-quote><p>They were talking about SARS and those sorts of things, where they&#8217;ve gone &#8220;oh you know, it&#8217;s gone, swine flu and everything. &#8220;Oh, you know, it was a beat up before, and it not&#8217;s going to be; it will be the same this time. It&#8217;ll be a hell-of-a-blue for nothing&#8221;, whereas I felt more like we dodged a bullet those other times and that it was more likely that this was going to be serious than not and that I guess being sick for so long makes me somewhat worse giver because like I really understand the consequences or things not going well.

The findings have ongoing relevance and may have implications for future pandemics, owing to the challenges faced in the implementation of public health interventions, where vaccines may not be readily available and health communication is vital.</p><p>Effective communication of health information is fundamental in aiding risk perception and is a key preventative control measure.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 2</sup></xref> Previous studies have indicated that the perceived risk of COVID-19 was higher in people with chronic disease than those without.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12 13 33</sup></xref> If examined more closely using the HBM domains, the results of this study demonstrated that those with a chronic disease understood the severity of COVID-19; however, low levels of perceived susceptibility appeared to be a driving force in suboptimal adherence, despite understanding potential severity. This finding is in contrast to previous results that those with chronic illness had a greater awareness of the susceptibility and risk of adverse events if COVID-19 was contracted owing to their chronic disease.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> However, in this study, perceptions surrounding susceptibility often focused on others close to them, such as elderly parents, who were deemed by the participants as at higher risk of susceptibility to infection and seemed to be more influential and motivated to adhere to infection control measures. These insights into how individuals consider susceptibility may inform targeted communication to some communities during future infection outbreaks.</p><p>Low levels of perceived susceptibility could be attributed both to health messages at the time not specifically targeting individuals at risk of COVID-19 and health messages changing rapidly and often being inconsistent between geographical locations.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> A lack of pre-pandemic preparedness in the communication of public health messages was also found. As a result, public health communication crisis was evaluated in Australia through the <italic toggle="yes">COVID-19 Roadmap to Recovery</italic> report.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> In the report, experts outline 10 communication strategies going forward that need to be considered and addressed.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Importantly, it highlighted the need for communication during a health crisis to be an iterative process to aid risk perception during an emergency event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Consultation between different hierarchical groups, including individuals targeted as at higher risk (eg, chronic disease), and government and institution bodies is necessary to develop and test health communication messages.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 6 35</sup></xref> In doing so, individuals will have a greater knowledge of risk perception at the time of an emergency event and be more likely to implement preventative health behaviours.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 6</sup></xref></p><p>Geography plays an important role in the participants&#8217; perceived risk. As demonstrated in this study, individuals may make health decisions based on geography to case numbers within the community, potentially placing them at an increased risk of susceptibility to COVID-19. Participants residing in rural locations perceived their risk to COVID-19 and transmission to be lower than their counterparts residing in metropolitan locations. This was perceived as a beneficial factor in assessing risk, with many using distance to hot spot areas or number of cases as a means to assessing preventative behaviours. This, in part, could be explained by the differences in COVID-19 status in the community at the time of interviews and public health orders in place and highlights how perception of risk may differ between geographical locations, pointing to the need for more overt messaging around risk during emerging pandemics for isolated communities who may feel removed from the situation. It also highlights the need for local strategies to complement that of national and international responses through coordination of communities, community primary care and health information systems to promote risk and preventative health communication in a mutually beneficial manner.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Conversely, concerns for the capacity of their local rural health services to manage an outbreak did not appear to be as prominent in public consciousness. This could be of a future concern for those residing in rural locations known to have poor access to healthcare, which may result in adverse health outcomes &#8211; particularly as the condition becomes increasingly framed as an endemic disease.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref></p><p>Health messaging can also result in ineffective communication. A study found that information provided by the media was a cue to action for uptake of preventative health behaviours.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Although our findings complemented, we also identified the potentially negative influence of high levels of risk perception on mental health and well-being, as a result of information overload or confusion because of heavy media coverage. Further, the abundance of information was not matched by relevance for those with chronic disease, limiting its effect on perceived risk. This finding demonstrates the need for further targeted health behaviour messaging and acknowledges limitations in current communication methods, with information being readily available through online social media.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> This adds a level of complexity to public health messaging, as the information delivered may not contain appropriate steps in risk reduction behaviours, further contributing to confusion and negatively affecting mental health and well-being. Additionally, our findings highlighted the role of personal contacts (rightly or wrongly), making statements to heighten a sense of risk. Given the transfer of information during these social interactions, exploring social relationships and how these shape decision making could also offer further insights for ongoing health information, as they offer a broader way of communicating the need for action of preventative health behaviours.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Together, these insights highlight the complexity and challenge of achieving balanced and accurate information for people with chronic diseases to navigate and manage risk while avoiding undue fear or anxiety.</p><p>This study has some limitations, as the research team was not able to clinically verify a participant&#8217;s chronic health disease and relied on participants&#8217; self-report of their chronic disease, potentially misinterpreting the experience of some participants. However, our findings demonstrate a need for people to have their risk of infection clearly communicated to allow them to make informed decisions on preventative behaviours. If future public health interventions are implemented for risk mitigation to combat future emergencies, the challenges that may be encountered to overcome the difficulties experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, including misinformation, negative experiences from lockdowns and politicisation of health, must be understood and improved for future health emergencies. Although trust did not emerge as a dominant theme in our interviews, participants&#8217; general acceptance of government advice may indicate an underlying baseline of trust in public health authorities during the study period. Maintaining and reinforcing this trust is essential for ensuring adherence to future public health measures, especially in contexts where perceived susceptibility is low. Our findings suggest that this is particularly important for individuals with chronic disease(s) and those residing in rural geographical locations, where tailored and trustworthy communication may be critical to enhancing risk perception and motivating preventative behaviours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2025-102202</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-9-s001.docx" id="d67e645" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP2" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2025-102202</object-id><label>online supplemental file 2</label><media xlink:href="bmjopen-15-9-s002.docx" id="d67e650" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the participants for taking time to participate in the project.
