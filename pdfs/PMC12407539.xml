Tests for such risk compensatory behaviour in high-risk populations, such as female sex workers (FSWs), are lacking. This study aims to assess whether risk compensatory behaviours were observed among FSWs in Senegal after the rollout of PrEP.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>In a randomised controlled trial with a Zelen design, we stratified FSWs in Dakar (Senegal) by self-reported sexual risk-taking and prior PrEP experience and randomly assigned them to immediate referral for oral PrEP (Treatment) from 7 September 2021 to end January 2022 or delayed PrEP referral (Control). We compared outcomes 3&#8211;8 months after the referral of the treatment group and before the referral of the control group. Primary outcomes were self-reported condom use with clients and perceived HIV/STI risks from sex with clients with and without a condom. The analysis is a modified intention-to-treat analysis. We estimated effects of PrEP referral as well as effects of oral PrEP use induced by randomised assignment to active PrEP referral. Out of 500 individuals randomised, 308 (61.6%) were included in the analysis (Treatment: 182/300&#8201;=&#8201;60.7%; Control: 126/200&#8201;=&#8201;63%). PrEP referral increased the probability of using oral PrEP by 34.5 percentage points (pp) (95% CI [25.4, 43.6]; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001). Estimated effects of PrEP referral and PrEP use on condom use with the last client were positive but not statistically significantly different from zero. PrEP referral was estimated to increase the probability of condom use with all of the last three clients by 11.0 pp (95% CI [0.8, 21.2]; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.034). PrEP use was estimated to increase this probability by 25.8 pp (95% CI [5.2, 46.4]; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.014). Main limitations were low power, high attrition, self-reported outcomes and a limited follow-up period.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study, conducted in one location, did not find evidence that PrEP referral or oral PrEP use increased self-reported risky sex behaviours of FSWs within 3&#8211;8 months. The robustness of this finding needs to be tested with larger cohorts followed for longer periods in other settings, and using survey instruments that allow further examination of whether PrEP users are more likely to overreport condom use.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ISRCTN&#8212;The UK&#8217;s Clinical Study Registry, ISRCTN16445862 <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN16445862" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN16445862</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Why was this study done?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is becoming an essential part of HIV prevention among high-risk populations in low- and middle-income countries.

However, there is concern that this protection may encourage risky sexual behaviour&#8212;<italic toggle="yes"><italic toggle="yes">risk compensation</italic>&#8212;</italic>that partially offsets the preventive effect [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For example, those taking PrEP may reduce their use of condoms or increase their sexual partners, which could increase the prevalence of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that PrEP does not protect against.</p><p>There is a paucity of evidence on risk compensatory behaviour in response to PrEP [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Most research on the topic has focussed on men who have sex with men and has delivered mixed evidence [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Risk compensation seems more evident in more recent studies [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which is consistent with an increasing behavioural response with growing awareness of PrEP&#8217;s effectiveness [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Female sex workers (FSWs) can charge a higher price for condomless sex and other risky sexual acts. This financial incentive may increase the prevalence of risk-compensatory behaviour by FSWs taking PrEP [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, there is a lack of robust evidence on the phenomenon in this population. Observational studies have shown mixed evidence [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] that is difficult to interpret because FSWs who take PrEP tend to engage in riskier sexual behaviours and, hence, may already be at higher risk of STIs prior to taking PrEP [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Qualitative research suggests that risk compensation may become more prevalent as FSWs become more convinced that PrEP is effective [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. On the other hand, PrEP provision may also bring hard-to-reach populations, such as FSWs, into closer contact with the health system, increasing access to free condoms and lubricants, and improving opportunities for routine STI testing and sexual health counselling [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In Senegal, sex work is legal conditional on registration. Registered FSWs are required to visit a public health centre every month for health checks. Due to the strong stigma attached to sex work, many FSWs choose to remain unregistered. In 2015, HIV/AIDS prevalence among FSWs (6.6 percent) was nine times higher than in the overall population [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In 2021/2022, Senegal rolled out oral PrEP to targeted high-risk populations, including FSWs. Before the rollout, oral PrEP had been temporarily offered to only a limited number of FSWs in a 2015/16 PrEP Demonstration Project that was discontinued. This study aimed to use the randomised 2021/22 rollout of oral PrEP to FSWs in Senegal to obtain causal evidence on whether there is risk compensation in response to use of this effective HIV preventive medication in a high-risk population.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Methods and findings</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The study was a stratified randomised controlled trial (RCT) registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN16445862). The study was approved by the National Ethics Committee for Research and Health Senegal (CNERS) (No. 00000031) and University College London (UCL) Research Ethics Committee (17341/001). It is reported following the CONSORT (<xref rid="pmed.1004458.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Consort Guidelines</xref>) and SPIRIT guideline (<xref rid="pmed.1004458.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 SPIRIT Guidelines</xref>) available as supplementary file. The trial protocol is provided as a supplementary file as well (<xref rid="pmed.1004458.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Trial Protocol</xref>).</p><p>Study participants were recruited from a list of FSWs who participated in a survey conducted between June and August 2020 in Dakar, Senegal. The survey was the third wave (after waves in 2015 and 2017) of a study following a cohort of FSWs at least 18 years old at entry. In each wave, the cohort was replenished with new participants who were recruited via snowball sampling by midwives at public health centres for registered FSWs and by peer facilitators for unregistered FSWs. By law, midwives are responsible for follow-up with registered FSWs.</p><p>We restricted study entry to survey participants who, based on information available in 2020, were potentially eligible for PrEP. That is, we excluded those who reported not doing sex work in 2020 and those who were recorded, in any wave, as having a public health system medical record showing they were HIV&#8211;positive. The 2020 survey was not a baseline for this study. It provided the base from which we recruited eligible study participants&#8212;approved by UCL Research Ethics Committee (17341/001)&#8212;and some data used for stratification and covariate controls. In each survey, consent was sought from participants for future contact.</p><p>The trial had a Zelen design [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]: informed consent was sought and obtained after randomisation. This design, including randomisation of the 2020 survey participants, was approved by the two ethics committees, without an explicit waiver of any requirement to obtain consent prior to random assignment for treatment. FSWs randomised to the treatment group were contacted and informed about the study&#8217;s purpose, procedures, potential risks and benefits. If they consented to participate, they were given an appointment the following day for PrEP referral. Three to eight months later, all 2020 survey participants potentially eligible for PrEP (in 2020) who had been randomised to either the treatment group or the control group were invited to participate in an endline survey held from 11 April to 13 May 2022. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants at the beginning of this survey. The control group participants were never invited to participate in the trial&#8217;s PrEP intervention. They were offered PrEP as part of its general rollout in Senegal after the trial. For the treatment group, the first consent for PrEP referral was 7 September 2021 and the last known consent was at the end of January 2022. For the control group, consent for PrEP referral was sought at the end of the endline survey.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Prior to contacting the 2020 survey participants who were potentially eligible for PrEP, on 10 October 2020, we randomised them to treatment and control groups (3:2) using a computer programme. Randomisation was stratified by prior experience with PrEP and sexual risk-taking, both of which were self-reported in the 2020 survey (Text A in <xref rid="pmed.1004458.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). A participant could have had PrEP experience through the discontinued PrEP demonstration project [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Any behavioural response to the present study&#8217;s intervention could have varied with prior PrEP exposure and propensity for risky sex behaviour, which was the reason for stratifying on these characteristics.</p><p>Enumerators were blind to treatment assignment when recording the primary outcomes&#8212;condom use and risk perceptions. After measurement of these outcomes, a question posed to only PrEP users revealed the treatment assignment of those participants. Treatment assignment remained blind for PrEP non-users. The midwives and peer facilitators who recruited FSWs to the endline survey were not blinded to the treatment assignment as they also helped with the referral for the PrEP intervention. They were not involved in collecting data.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Procedures</title><p>The intervention was referral for oral PrEP. It was planned that rollout would begin soon after randomisation in October 2020, but it was delayed for various reasons. From early September 2021 to January 2022, midwives at public health centres and FSW peer facilitators actively contacted FSWs assigned to the treatment group and asked if they were interested in receiving PrEP. The midwives and FSW facilitators received comprehensive training from the HIV Division of the Ministry of Health and Social Action (MoH) that developed the national PrEP protocol. The training included guidance on counselling, referral processes, and addressing potential barriers to PrEP uptake. Eligible participants were contacted by phone by a midwife or an FSW facilitator, who provided information about PrEP and its benefits. Participants who expressed interest and provided verbal consent were invited for PrEP eligibility screening on the following day at one of the designated referral sites.</p><p>The MoH and a non-governmental organisation&#8212;the Alliance Nationale Contre le SIDA (ANCS)&#8212;were the entities responsible for PrEP implementation, which included eligibility screening, PrEP distribution and follow-up visits. The MoH was mainly responsible for registered FSWs, who were screened and given PrEP at public health centres. ANCS mainly targeted unregistered FSWs and used community sites and mobile clinics for PrEP screening and distribution. PrEP eligibility was set by national guidelines that stipulated that oral PrEP be given to those (a) still doing sex work and (b) meeting medical criteria: (i) good liver function measured by creatinine level, (ii) HIV&#8211;negative, and (iii) not pregnant. Those identified as eligible were offered PrEP. The PrEP implementation partners were asked to defer PrEP screening of FSWs in the control group until after the endline survey. Treatment and control group participants who were still in sex work, not using PrEP and reported being interested in receiving it were referred for PrEP screening after the endline survey.</p><p>As the MoH and ANCS were responsible for PrEP implementation, for the treatment group, we have only incomplete information from administrative data on losses at each stage of recruitment and PrEP uptake. And there are no administrative data for the control group. Hence, the primary source of data is the endline survey, which was fielded from 11 April to 13 May 2022&#8212;3&#8211;8 months after the treatment group was referred for PrEP. We received no reported adverse events from the MoH and ANCS.</p><p>To recruit survey participants, midwives and FSW peer facilitators attempted to contact all FSWs randomised to either the treatment group or the control group. The interviews were carried out by trained enumerators at four public health centres, rented premises nearby, or quarters of trusted FSW facilitators. The survey asked about PrEP utilisation, preventive health and sexual behaviours.</p><p>Participants were asked: &#8220;Are you currently on PrEP to prevent HIV?&#8221;. We coded those responding positively as 1 for the binary indicator <italic toggle="yes">PrEP use</italic>. Participants were also asked: &#8220;Have you started taking PrEP this year or last year?&#8221;. We coded those responding positively as 1 for the indicator <italic toggle="yes">Ever used PrEP in past year</italic>. These self-reports of PrEP utilisation were cross-checked, as far as possible, with MoH and ANCS records, and by asking midwives and FSW facilitators to confirm whether each participant was effectively receiving PrEP at a health facility.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The main objective was to determine whether PrEP affected condom use with clients. In the endline survey, we asked each participant to recall their last three clients and whether a condom had been used with each of them (Table A in <xref rid="pmed.1004458.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). We created two binary primary outcomes: (a) 1 if a condom was used with the last client, and 0 otherwise; (b) 1 if a condom was used with all three clients, and 0 otherwise. These were multiple outcomes: a negative effect on either would be of concern. In supplementary analysis, we estimated effects on other prespecified outcomes: directly reported condom use with the penultimate client and measures of condom use elicited with two indirect methods that aimed to reduce reporting errors. In one of these&#8212;the double list experiment [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]&#8212;participants reported the number of correct statements from a list (Text B in <xref rid="pmed.1004458.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). In both the treatment and control groups, participants were randomly assigned to one of two lists that differed by the inclusion or exclusion of a statement about condom use. The difference in the means of the reported number of correct statements between the two lists gave an estimate of condom use prevalence in the treatment group and in the control group. The other indirect elicitation instrument&#8212;the colorbox method [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]&#8212;obscured the participant&#8217;s reported condom use from the survey enumerator (Text C in <xref rid="pmed.1004458.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>We used a 5-point Likert scale (1: Very unlikely,&#8230; 5: Very likely) to elicit perceptions of the risk of contracting HIV (STI) through sex with someone with HIV (STI) (a) if a condom were not used and (b) if a condom were used (Table A in <xref rid="pmed.1004458.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). For each of HIV and STI, we created a binary outcome equal to 1 if the perceived risk was at or above the median response (= 5) in scenario (a): <italic toggle="yes">High risk without condom</italic>. Another binary outcome was 1 if the perceived risk was not above the median response (= 1) in scenario (b): <italic toggle="yes">Low risk with condom</italic>. We created a third outcome equal to 1 if both these indicators were equal to 1: <italic toggle="yes">High risk without and low risk with condom</italic>.</p><p>We included aspects of risky sex behaviours other than condom use as secondary outcomes. We asked participants to report the number of clients they had in a typical week and how many were regulars (as opposed to occasional clients). We calculated the proportion of regular clients. We asked each participant to report the average number of sex acts performed with each of their last three clients and whether they had oral sex and anal sex with any of these clients. Since a low proportion (&lt;1%) reported anal sex, this outcome is not reported. Participants also reported their perceptions of the HIV risk of each of their last three clients (11-point Likert scale: 0&#8201;=&#8201;no risk, 10&#8201;=&#8201;very high risk). We created a binary outcome equal to 1 if a participant&#8217;s maximum risk perception of the three reported was greater than the median (= 0). In addition, without pre-registration, we asked participants to report on an 11-point Likert scale how much risk they took in their recent sexual behaviours (0&#8201;=&#8201;Limits risks, 10&#8201;=&#8201;Likes to take risks). From this, we created a binary post-hoc secondary outcome equal to 1 if the response was above the median (= 1).</p><p>In the registered trial protocol, the specified primary outcomes were directly reported condom use with the last client, the penultimate client and all of the last five clients, as well as condom use elicited with the two indirect methods and perceptions of risks of contracting HIV and STI. Prior to fielding the endline survey&#8212;and therefore before the data lock&#8212;we decided to reduce the survey burden by asking (directly) about condom use with the last three clients, not the last five. We did not seek ethical board approval for this change because it involved collecting less data. In addition to those described above, pre-registered secondary outcomes included price charged to each of the last two clients, household expenditures and earnings from sex work in the last 30 days, food insecurity, self-reported STI symptoms with last two clients and mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire -9). After data collection and unlocking of the data, we decided not to use these outcomes in order to focus on risky sexual behaviours, which was further achieved by adding the post-hoc secondary outcome on subjective risk-taking. For consistency with the condom use outcomes, we used type of sex acts with the last three clients, not the last two as specified in the protocol.</p><p>We calculated the minimum detectable effect (MDE) on condom use with the last client given the fixed number of participants available from the 2020 survey. We assumed a drop-out rate of 10% from the original study size of 500 individuals due to survey and sex work attrition, a 5% PrEP ineligibility rate, a PrEP adoption rate of 82.4%, based on the rate achieved in the demonstration project [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and a baseline condom use rate of 67.9%, based on the estimated prevalence in the 2020 survey elicited using list experiments. With 80% power and a two-sided two-sample proportion test (alpha&#8201;=&#8201;0.05), for condom use with the last client, we calculated the intention-to-treat (ITT) MDE of PrEP referral as 13.1 percentage points (pp) and the MDE of PrEP use of 16.8 pp. We did not allow for covariates in the power calculations but adjusted for them in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We report percentages of the treatment group and control group who reported using PrEP at the time of the endline survey interview <italic toggle="yes">(PrEP use</italic>) and in the 12 months preceding that interview <italic toggle="yes">(Ever used PrEP in past year)</italic>, with binomial exact confidence intervals (CIs). We also provide whether the difference in PrEP usage is statistically significant between both groups using an unadjusted logistic regression. We used covariate-adjusted logistic regression to estimate the effect of assignment to PrEP referral &#8211; consisting of screening to establish eligibility and the offer of PrEP if eligible &#8211; on the probability of using PrEP (<italic toggle="yes">PrEP use</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Ever used PrEP in past year</italic>). In this analysis, and all others, we conducted inference with robust standard errors, which allowed for any form of unequal variances between groups [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. CIs and p-values (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>) were obtained from these standard errors.</p><p>We estimated modified intention-to-treat (ITT) effects of PrEP referral on the outcomes. Modification was due to randomisation prior to seeking consent and loss to follow-up because of attrition from sex work and the survey. We did not estimate effects of the offer of PrEP conditional on being deemed eligible since we had no information about eligibility in the control arm. We used adjusted logistic regression to estimate the risk difference (RD) in each primary (binary) outcome caused by PrEP referral. This is the estimated referral-induced change in the outcome probability for each participant (at observed covariates) averaged over all participants.</p><p>We estimated RDs in each primary outcome caused by <italic toggle="yes">PrEP use</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Ever used PrEP in past year</italic>. To allow for non-random variation in PrEP use resulting from two-sided non-compliance, we used an encouragement design [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], with randomised assignment to active PrEP referral effectively used as an instrumental variable for PrEP use. For each outcome and each PrEP use measure, we used an adjusted recursive bivariate probit model for use (as a function of referral) and the respective outcome to estimate the RD as the change in the outcome probability induced by PrEP use averaged over all participants. We also calculated this RD relative to the predicted outcome probability if there were no PrEP use, which was obtained by averaging predicted outcomes from the estimated bivariate probit under the counterfactual of no PrEP use. In supplementary analysis, we treated the categorical risk perceptions reported on a 5-point Likert scale as linear measures, scaled 1&#8211;5, and used ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the mean difference (MD) in each of these outcomes caused by PrEP referral. We used two-stage least squares (2SLS)&#8212;with randomisation to PrEP referral as an instrument for PrEP use&#8212;to estimate the MD in each of these outcomes caused by each measure of PrEP use.</p><p>Covariate adjustment was done to (a) control for any treatment-control group imbalance that may have resulted from attrition, (b) increase precision, and (c) control for systematic non-compliance when estimating effects of PrEP use. The covariates used in all analyses were age (years), number of days in the seven preceding the endline interview that were within Ramadan&#8212;to account for the reduction in sex work during Ramadan&#8212;and 2020 values of marital status, FSW registration status, self-reported sexual risk taking, prior PrEP experience and the respective lagged outcome. In supplementary analysis, we estimated effects on the condom use outcomes without covariate adjustment and with entropy balancing [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] used to reweight and match, on moments of covariates, (a) the (post-attrition) cohort used for analysis to the pre-attrition cohort and (b) the treatment group to the control group in the analysis cohort.</p><p>We used adjusted logistic regression and bivariate probit to estimate RDs in binary secondary outcomes associated with PrEP referral and (each measure of) PrEP use, respectively. To estimate MDs in non-binary secondary outcomes associated with PrEP referral and use, we used OLS and 2SLS, respectively.</p><p>To assess whether PrEP users viewed PrEP and condoms as substitutable or complementary methods of HIV prevention, we asked only these participants to report on a 5-point Likert scale (1: Very unlikely, 5: Very likely) their perceptions of the risk of contracting HIV through sex with someone with HIV if they were to use (a) no PrEP and no condom, (b) no PrEP but a condom, (c) PrEP but no condom, and (d) both PrEP and a condom.

We did not find evidence that PrEP reduced condom use. Neither referral for PrEP nor its use had a statistically significant effect on the probability of using a condom with the last client. Both PrEP referral and PrEP use were estimated to increase the probability of using a condom with the last three clients. Among the study participants, exposure to PrEP was associated with strengthened perceptions of the effectiveness of condoms in preventing HIV infection, although these estimates are not statistically significant. PrEP exposure was not associated with other measure of risky sex behaviour.</p><p>While we focussed on PrEP use, it is important to note that PrEP is not offered in isolation. The way it is implemented may influence outcomes. A PrEP programme provides an additional health system touchpoint to potentially improve sexual health and influence sexual behaviours of a hard-to-reach population, such as sex workers. In Senegal, PrEP users were advised to continue using condoms because PrEP does not protect against other STIs. Free condoms are distributed to registered FSWs. Anecdotally, health ministry officials told the study team that more condoms were dispensed at public health centres after the introduction of PrEP, which is consistent with our finding that PrEP increased condom use. Registration of FSWs in Senegal since 1969 potentially contributed to it. While not implemented yet in Senegal, targeting STI screening on PrEP users may increase the benefits of PrEP. The optimal frequency of this screening would need to be determined [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>We found no evidence to suggest that PrEP exposure eroded beliefs in the effectiveness of condom use in preventing HIV. While not statistically significant, among study participants, estimates across various specifications consistently suggest that those exposed to PrEP perceived condoms to be more effective. Further, a substantial proportion of PrEP users reported believing that condom use provides substantial additional protection to PrEP, and vice versa. Together with an increase in condom use, these pieces of evidence are consistent with PrEP users currently seeing it as complementary to condom use in HIV prevention, and not a substitute for condoms.</p><p>Nonetheless, PrEP is highly effective if taken as prescribed [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. If trust in PrEP were to increase, then there may be a risk of falling condom use in response to adjusted beliefs about the marginal benefit of condoms in preventing HIV. In that scenario, prevalence of STIs would be expected to rise.</p><p>Optimism about lower HIV risk due to PrEP rollout may spill over to non-users of PrEP, which would also have consequences for HIV prevalence. Such scenarios suggest that, notwithstanding the findings of this study, vigilance is warranted as beliefs about the effectiveness of PrEP and condoms evolve.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, it was underpowered for precise estimation of effects on the condom use outcomes. A post-hoc power analysis based on the ex-ante MDE revealed that, for PrEP use, there is only 24% power for estimation of the effect on condom use with the last client, but 62% power for the effect on condom use with the last three clients. However, we calculated that there is only a 0.3% chance that the statistically significant estimate of PrEP referral increasing condom use with the last three clients is in the wrong direction (Type S error) [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which means it is unlikely that the study failed to detect true risk compensation behaviour of reduced condom use in response to PrEP. Nonetheless, the finding that PrEP did not reduce condom use should be confirmed by studies with larger samples or the estimate from this study should be combined with other estimates in a meta-analysis.</p><p>Lower-than-expected power was partly due to delayed PrEP rollout that did not start, as scheduled, soon after the 2020 survey. This increased survey and sex work attrition. Two-sided non-compliance was also higher than anticipated. PrEP take-up in the treatment group was much lower than 82% seen in a PrEP demonstration study [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, while study partners were asked to delay PrEP rollout in the control group until after the endline, this proved hard to implement. Nonetheless, randomised PrEP referral did substantially increase PrEP use, which made it possible to estimate the behavioural response, and we identified it only from the experiment-induced random variation in PrEP use. Null effects on secondary outcomes are consistent with no marked behavioural response to PrEP, which gives greater confidence that the finding of no reduction in condom use was not merely attributable to low power.</p><p>Second, the outcomes were primarily self-reported and may differ from actual behaviour due to intentional and unintentional misreporting that could result from social desirability bias and recall bias, respectively. If the degree of misreporting were to have differed between the treatment and control groups, it would bias estimated effects of PrEP. The bias would be upward if the treatment group were to overreport condom use to a greater extent. To assess this risk, in addition to directly asking participants about their use of condoms, we used two indirect elicitation methods. Although these methods tended to give smaller (and not statistically significant) estimates of increased condom use caused by PrEP referral and use than the estimates obtained via direct elicitation, the main result of no negative effect of PrEP on condom use was robust to the measurement of condom use.</p><p>There are two caveats to this robustness. First, the estimate obtained with double list experiment may be unreliable because the method embedded an elicitation experiment within the PrEP experiment. This further reduced statistical power, which is the reason it was not used as the primary outcome measure. Second, the colorbox elicitation method gave estimates of condom use prevalence similar to those obtained with direct elicitation, which suggests that if the latter was prone to misreporting, the former was not effective in reducing the error. Future research should further investigate whether PrEP programmes influence incentives to misreport condom use. In this study, without biomarker outcomes, such as STI diagnoses or the detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Y-chromosomal DNA, it is not possible to test whether the finding that PrEP did not increase unprotected intercourse is robust to using a more objective measure of that outcome. While PSA and Y-chromosomal DNA have been used to measure unprotected sex, these methods also have limitations, including short detection windows, potential discrepancies between markers [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and complications, like condom slippage and distinguishing between sex with clients and boyfriends. Logistical, ethical and participant comfort considerations made it impractical to use biomarkers in this study setting.</p><p>Third, it was infeasible to estimate effects of PrEP on longer-term outcomes. Even though the overall HIV prevalence in Senegal is low (0.3%), among FSWs it is relatively high (6.6%) [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hence, an extended delay of PrEP rollout in a control group would likely be considered unethical. Further, compliance in the treatment arm would likely decrease considerably over time, while contamination in the control arm would increase. Attrition from sex work and the survey would worsen with time. Short-term outcomes could differ from longer-term ones, especially since PrEP users among the study participants seemed to perceive that condom use provides substantial additional HIV protection on top of PrEP, even when PrEP should offer 99% protection against HIV when used consistently. Furthermore, the increasing awareness of clients about the introduction of PrEP in Senegal coupled with the low bargaining power of FSWs may reduce condom use in the longer term [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There could also be community-level risk compensation of non-PrEP users when awareness of the prevalence of PrEP usage increases among FSWs [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Community-level risk compensation would invalidate RCT estimates unless properly accounted for.</p><p>Fourth, participants were not specifically recruited for the RCT and were randomised before attempts were made to contact those assigned to the treatment group for consent, leaving scope for differential study participation between the treatment and control groups, which is a particular concern given a high rate of attrition (49%). However, we showed that treatment assignment had no effect on study participation, we adjusted for covariates and demonstrated robustness of the estimated effects on condom use to this adjustment and to matching the analysis cohort participants to the pre-attrition cohort and the treatment group to the control group in the analysis cohort.</p><p>Fifth, the study exerted substantial effort to trace and recruit FSWs in the treatment arm. Some of those recruited might not have been reached, made aware of PrEP and sufficiently convinced of its benefits to agree to take it if there were business-as-usual rollout of the medication [<xref rid="pmed.1004458.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This may have increased the proportion of PrEP users in the treatment arm above what could be expected in normal circumstances, although take-up in the RCT was substantially lower than it was in an earlier demonstration study.</p><p>Sixth, sex work is legal in Senegal and the system already has existing public healthcare clinics providing care to registered FSWs. In addition, HIV prevalence in Senegal is relatively low. Therefore, the findings of this study may not necessarily extend to countries with different circumstances.</p><p>In summary, this study did not find evidence of risk compensation through reduced condom use in response to PrEP. In fact, the estimated effect on one condom use outcome is positive, suggesting that the PrEP programme may have reached FSWs who otherwise would have had less access to free condoms or health system advice on condom use. Findings suggest that beliefs of condom effectiveness may potentially have increased, and condoms are still viewed as complementary to PrEP usage. Larger studies are required to confirm the findings. Studies on longer term outcomes are also necessary as risk compensation may potentially increase with increased experience of PrEP.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"

</p><p>Dear Dr L&#233;pine,</p><p>Many thanks for submitting your manuscript "Effect of pre-exposure prophylaxis on risky sexual behaviour of female sex workers in Dakar, Senegal: A randomised controlled trial" (PMEDICINE-D-24-02342R1) to PLOS Medicine. The paper has been reviewed by subject experts and a statistician; their comments are included below and can also be accessed here: [LINK]</p><p>As you will see, the reviewers commented on the importance of such a study, but raised serious methodological and reporting concerns. We would like to emphasize that a very careful and thorough revision will be essential to satisfy both the reviewers and the academic editor at re-review.</p><p>After discussing the paper with the editorial team and an academic editor with relevant expertise, I'm pleased to invite you to revise the paper in response to the reviewers' comments. We plan to send the revised paper to some or all of the original reviewers, and we cannot provide any guarantees at this stage regarding publication.</p><p>When you upload your revision, please include a point-by-point response that addresses all of the reviewer and editorial points, indicating the changes made in the manuscript and either an excerpt of the revised text or the location (eg: page and line number) where each change can be found. Please also be sure to check the general editorial comments at the end of this letter and include these in your point-by-point response. When you resubmit your paper, please include a clean version of the paper as the main article file and a version with changes tracked as a marked-up manuscript. It may also be helpful to check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper.</p><p>We ask that you submit your revision by Oct 17 2024. However, if this deadline is not feasible, please contact me by email, and we can discuss a suitable alternative.</p><p>Don't hesitate to contact me directly with any questions (atosun@plos.org). </p><p>Best regards, </p><p>Alexandra </p><p>Alexandra Tosun, PhD </p><p>Associate Editor</p><p>PLOS Medicine</p><p>atosun@plos.org</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Comments from the academic editor:</p><p>The topic is both important and timely, also in light of a recent systematic review (Murchu et al., 2022) that highlighted the paucity of data on PreP-associated risk compensation.</p><p>The study appears to be at high risk of bias, and the advance over existing knowledge with clear implications for patient care, public policy, or clinical research agendas needs to be made much clearer. </p><p>The very high attrition rate (almost 40%, despite the short follow-up period) needs to be discussed in detail and its implications for the reported results. The self-reported outcome measures on condom use are known to be prone to social desirability bias. There were no biological outcomes related to condom use, such as STIs or vaginal detection of prostate-specific antigen or Y-chromosomal DNA, which have been used in previous studies (see e.g. Gigu&#232;re et al. 2019). This probably cannot be remedied, but should be discussed in greater detail. </p><p>The apparent change in the outcome measure pointed out by the careful statistical reviewer will be important to address. The results of this study seem to be on the inconclusive side, which is only partially acknowledged by the authors.</p><p>Also, the reporting should be substantially improved. For example, it's unclear whether the participants gave informed consent, and the exact timing of the FSW randomization remains unclear (Zelen design?).</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Comments from the reviewers: </p><p>Reviewer #1: Thanks for the opportunity to read your manuscript. My role is statistical reviewer, so I have focused on the design, data, and analysis that are presented. I have put general comments first, followed by questions relevant to a specific section of the manuscript (with a page/paragraph reference). </p><p>This RCT examines if referral to PrEP in female sex workers from Senegal leads to changes sexual risk-taking. Participants were recruited from a longitudinal study of FSWs, who were initially recruited from referral from FSWs using public health clinics, or local leaders of FSW groups. Potential participants were those active in sex work and did not have a status of HIV positive recorded. Participants were randomised (3:2 ratio PrEP:control), with active attempts in the PrEP arm to contact participants to see if they were interested in receiving PrEP. Randomisation was done on complete sampling frames, with fixed proportions randomised to either treatment or control. Follow-up data collection was part of the ongoing longitudinal study, with 17% of participants randomised to the PrEP arm not responsive, and 21% not responsive in the control arm. The primary outcomes reported in the manuscript is self-report condom use with clients, the first outcome was condom use with last client, the second is condom use with all of last three clients. The main analyses were intention-to-treat with regards to take-up of PrEP after referral. A range of secondary analyses are considered, including take-up of PrEP at the main follow-up visit. The main analyses used linear models and generalised linear models to estimate treatment effects. A per-protocol estimate is included, using instrumental variable analysis. Participants in the PrEP arm were much more likely to report PrEP use. In the main ITT analysis there was no evidence of treatment effect for condom use with last client, and a modest increase in use of a condom with all of the three last clients. </p><p>Did participants in the ongoing longitudinal survey consent to participating in a randomised trial in the future? If not, was a waiver of consent approval sought for this RCT?</p><p>Three primary outcomes are identified in the protocol - condom use in last two clients, condom use in last 5 clients, and subjective perceptions of condom use on a likert scale. In the manuscript, there are two primary outcomes, condom use with last client, and condom use with three last clients, with the Likert outcome moved to a secondary outcome. The online registration also mentions three different modes of capturing condom use with clients. Were the list experiment and newly designed instrument detailed in the online registration used in the end? When was the decision to change the definition of the primary outcomes from the protocol to the version in the manuscript? Was this before or after unblinding? </p><p>Missing data in this study is treated with a complete-case analysis, i.e. assuming that data is 'missing completely at random', and with a relatively large number of participants who missed the follow-up survey. An additional analysis that considers the data to be 'missing at random' (e.g. IPW, MI) should be considered in a revision. </p><p>One of the limitations of the study is that study participants were not specifically recruited for the RCT and are randomised before they are contacted for the study (similar to a Zelen's design or Trial Within Cohort). I would also recommend a sensitivity analysis of a 'missing-not-at-random' scenario for any post-randomisation differential effect of the PrEP contact/visit on follow-up (e.g. controlled imputations with delta adjustment or a tipping point analysis).</p><p>Page 7, Paragraph 1. Were the two primary outcomes (last client and last three clients) considered co-primary or multiple outcomes? E.g. was 'success' of the trial considered to be effect in both outcomes, or either outcome? </p><p>Were study staff collecting the follow-up data blinded to the treatment allocation?</p><p>Page 8, Paragraph 3. What covariates were used in the adjusted regression models? Are these the ones listed on page 9? Are the same variables used in every analysis reported? What was the rationale for including these covariates?</p><p>Could a further explanation be provided about the estimated effect - does the 'outcome probability averaged over the sample' mean that the observed margins were used instead of reference values? </p><p>Page 10, Paragraph 3. I would remove the test of baseline characteristics, as the only way to see a 'significant' difference is by chance (in Table 1 as well). CONSORT makes specific recommendations to not report these. </p><p>Table S1. I would drop the p-values from this table, as the only reason there can be a difference between baseline characteristics is by chance. </p><p>Reviewer #2: The article describes the results of a randomised trial among female sex workers in Senegal testing the effects of (randomised) referral to PrEP services and (resulting) PrEP use on self-reported condom use. The need for this study is clearly justified, and the trial is clearly described and reported. The results clearly show no decline in condom use among FSWs referred to PrEP services or ultimately using PrEP, but also show that this may be linked to misunderstandings about the necessity of concomitant condom use alongside PrEP for maximum PrEP impact on HIV risk. This is an important study and results, adding to our knowledge of real-world PrEP use among FSWs. I have some suggestions for clarifications and edits which would further improve this article, below.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. There was quite substantial attrition in the trial (both survey and sex work attrition), which I would like to see more clearly highlighted in the article. In the results, where you report the numbers excluded for these reasons, please also present the % excluded for these reasons. In the discussion, instead of mentioning the high attrition rate and consequent reduced power at the end of a point about future studies, I would like to see the high attrition listed explicitly as a limitation at the start of one of these points.</p><p>2. P20, paragraph 4: 'Table 4 shows estimates of effects of PrEP referral and PrEP use on beliefs about the effectiveness of condoms in preventing HIV and STIs.' Should this be Table 3? Please check. Similarly, later in that paragraph where you refer to SM Table S5, I think this should be SM Table S4. At the end of the paragraph, where you mention 'Estimates of effects of PrEP referral on beliefs about the effectiveness of condoms in preventing other STIs do not show the same consistency, have much larger p-values and much smaller effects', please add references to the relevant tables showing this information (Table 3 and Table S4)</p><p>3. P21, paragraph 2: '9% of PrEP users answered that they are likely or very likely to being infected by HIV when using PrEP only versus 20% for condom only' I think these are labelled the wrong way round, so it should be '9%... when using condoms only versus 20% for PrEP only'. Please check and correct.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. There are minor spelling and grammatical errors throughout. A few are listed below, but I suggest a thorough proof-reading of the article before resubmission</p><p>a. Abstract: Background: generates negative -&gt; generate negative</p><p>b. P14, Methods: 'and full protocol is available on the UCL repository' -&gt; and the full protocol is available in the UCL repository</p><p>c. P14, Study design and participants: 'excluding those who (a)&#8230;' there is no corresponding '(b)'</p><p>d. P15, Intervention: 'Those who eligible' -&gt; 'Those who were eligible'</p><p>2. Abstract, Findings: for consistency, please include the p-value for final set of results presented (effect of PrEP use on condom use with all 3 last clients), and please include 'pp' as units for this</p><p>3. You mention several times that midwives recruited participants - was it really midwives rather than nurses? Midwives assist women in childbirth, so it seems unlikely that they would have a recruitment role in a PrEP trial</p><p>4. P16, Outcomes: for the scale eliciting beliefs about the likelihood of contracting HIV/STI, it is unclear how the information in a) (with and without use of a condom) differs from the information obtained from b) and c) together. It may be helpful to reproduce the questions in the appendix?</p><p>5. P16, Pre-experiment power calculation: the reader may not know what list experiments are. These are explained further in the discussion, but it may be helpful to clarify here, or add some information in an appendix which can be referred to here</p><p>6. P19/p20: is 'recently used PrEP' the same as 'having used PrEP in 2021/22'? If so it would help to define recently used PrEP as this, or even to use the same phrase throughout</p><p>7. P20, paragraph 2: 'Table 2 shows estimates of ITT effects of PrEP referral, effects of PrEP use on condom use and effects of having used PrEP in 2021/2022.' Are the effects all on condom use? It's a bit unclear from this sentence.</p><p>8. P20, paragraph 3: 'alternative outcome specification' - it would helpful to briefly summarise what this was</p><p>9. P21, Discussion, paragraph 1: '&#8230;among PrEP users and FSWs recently exposed&#8230;' for clarity, I suggest changing this to '&#8230;among PrEP users or among FSWs recently exposed'</p><p>10. P21, Discussion, paragraph 1: 'When taking all three clients together' I suggest clarifying to say '&#8230;all three most recent clients together'</p><p>11. P23, last paragraph: 'The latter method&#8230;' do you mean the colorbox method? Please make clear.</p><p>12. References: reference 1 gives an out-of-date link. For preference, use a peer-reviewed article as a source for this information.</p><p>Reviewer #3: The study examines whether oral PrEP use leads to risk compensation among female sex workers (FSWs) in Dakar, Senegal, through a randomized controlled trial. The intervention arm received a 4-month PrEP referral program, while the control arm did not receive PrEP referral until the end of the study. The authors found that PrEP use did not significantly decrease condom use or increase other sexual risk behaviors, suggesting no immediate risk compensation effects. While the results are reassuring, there are several methodological areas that could be improved, particularly how the planned intention-to treat analysis was handled. Major critiques are highlighted below:</p><p>Introduction</p><p>1. The PrEP landscape is rapidly evolving with multiple PrEP options. Please consistently specify the modality (oral) of the PrEP referenced. </p><p>Methods</p><p>1 The authors mention that participants gave consent to each survey, but it is not clear if the participants also provided consent to the RCT?</p><p>2 Randomization was stratified by PrEP experience and sexual risk-taking behavior, which makes sense. Can the author briefly state their rationale in the text?</p><p>3 It is not clear when the randomization occurred? Please clarify. </p><p>4 Additional details of randomization process are needed. Who was blinded to groups assignment? Were the staff who administered the endline survey blinded? Where the staff who contacted the participant in the intervention arm blinded? Or what measures were put in place to minimize bias in assessment?</p><p>5 The intervention only lasted for 4 months, from October 2021 to January 2022, while there are two years between the two waves of the survey. HIV risk and exposure is a dynamic and not static process that there can be a lot of changes even in a space of 3 months. Can the author clarify their rationale for conducting only a 4-month PrEP referral program during the two-year follow up period?</p><p>6 Additional information about the intervention is needed? How were the midwives and FSW facilitators trained in referring FSWs to PrEP? How often did they reach out, and in what way? If a participant showed no interest in PrEP, would they receive another contact? How long did it typically take from referral to PrEP screening?</p><p>7 For data collection, can the author add more details about the variables collected? For example, how was PrEP utilization assessed in the survey?</p><p>8 The authors examined PrEP use in two ways: current use at the time of the endline survey and recent PrEP use but there is no clear description of this classification is provided. Can the authors define recent PrEP use? Based on the results section, recent PrEP use refers to PrEP use in 2021 and 2022. Can the author justify why this period was used? Why was PrEP use during the entire follow-up period or after the start of the PrEP referral program not measured?</p><p>9 Please clarify what "exposure to Ramadan within 7 days" refers to?</p><p>10 Can the authors specify more details on the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the actual analysis?</p><p>11 The intervention was referral for PrEP. So, there was no attempt for any form baseline assessment for the control group. A design in which the evaluation between the two groups is not similar always bound to introduce bias. Please justify. </p><p>12 The RCT was designed to evaluate the effect of the 4-month PrEP referral program on changes in sexual behaviors among FSWs. However, the question the presented in analysis presented by authors aimed to answer focuses on PrEP use and sexual behaviors, which is not the primary question of the study. </p><p>13 In an intent-to-treat analysis, participants are analyzed based on the group they were randomized to regardless of whether they actually participate or not in the assigned group or not. So, the primary which focus on 182 vs 126, is modified ITT</p><p>14 For the FSW population, as the probability of condomless sex is already high. Did authors consider focus on analysis focused change in trends or change from baseline analysis? </p><p>15 Similar to my comment above, this is a longitudinal study but there was no attempt assess the change in risk behaviors, given that the main question is about risk compensation (i.e., change in risk)?</p><p>16 It seems the analytic implicitly assumes that the covariance of the measured matrices to be homogeneous in the two groups NOT heterogeneous which seems be an oversimplification given the differences in outcome assessment for treatment vs control. Indeed, if there is heterogeneity in variance across groups, repeated measures analysis utilizing Kenward and Roger's adjustment would be preferred. Please provide justification for your approach.</p><p>17 In the power estimation, an attention rate of 10% was assumed, However, from the n=500 randomized individual to final analytic sample n=308, it represents nearly 40% attrition and for the true ITT sample n=415, it's ~17% attrition. It possible that the observed null effect could be due to type II error? Can the authors do power simulation based in the final sample size to estimate the available power? Also, what were the characteristics of those no included in those two samples compared to those not included in the analysis?</p><p>Results</p><p>1. Table 1 should present the characteristics of participants who were randomized n=500.</p><p>2. It is not appropriate to call an analysis which excludes participants who indicated that they no longer engaged in sex work in the 2022 survey post-randomization an intent-to-treat analysis. Importantly, the action of no longer being engaged in sex work, is an outcome of the study&#8212;as it may indicate is the change HIV and thus no need for PrEP. Thus, an ITT analysis should focus on n=247 in the intervention arm vs n=158 in control arm. The arbitrary division of analysis into no longer in sex work vs still sex work non-responders leads to destruction of information and unjustified causal association interpretation. Can the author conduct an analysis by including these participants?</p><p>3. In the second paragraph of the results section, the first sentence states that randomization occurred two years after the 2020 survey. Clarify when the randomization actually took place?</p><p>4. HIV risk as well as perceived risk is a dynamic process with change from time to time. Thus, to use data collected 2 years prior as the baseline may be an oversimplification of the constancy assumption. Although on average randomization would be expected to balance the group on measured/unmeasured factors, the sample size of 500 with 3:2 ratio is quite small to guarantee balance between groups especially within the key stratification categories. </p><p>5. What was the median time from randomization to the administration of the endline survey? How did that differ by arm. In the intervention arm, what was the median time large from referral to picking up PrEP?</p><p>6. What proportion of participants in the control arm had PrEP referral and/or PrEP exposure during the intervention period? And how did that affect estimates</p><p>7. The paragraph starting with "Table 4 shows estimates of effects of PrEP referral" should refer to Table 3 instead.</p><p>8. In Tables 2 and 3, the reference group means for the regressions of PrEP referral, PrEP use, and ever PrEP use are different. Please specify the reference group means separately.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>1. Can the author discuss potential contamination of the control group and its implications. </p><p>Minor </p><p>1. Third paragraph in the section of study design and participants, methods, delete "a)" </p><p>2. 2nd paragraph in the section of intervention, methods, it should be "experimental and control arms"</p><p>Reviewer #4: Important and interesting RCT looking at whether prep use causes risk compensation. This is important for understanding the full benefits of prep. The results are interesting although the high LTFU rate raised concerns, and it is a pity that the study relies on self-reported condom use which is a weak measure. My comments are as follows:</p><p>1. Great introduction to the paper laying out the existing knowledge.</p><p>2. It was worrying to see the authors had limited data on aspects of the prep intervention, although it is unclear. Can you make it clearer what data was available for each arm and what was not. </p><p>3. They say they checked self-reported prep use data - how well could that be done?</p><p>4. It is a pity the authors could not use a biological test or an anonymous method for condom use on the FSW because self-reported condom use is biased. This is something the study authors recognise and may have biased the prep users more if they were attending services more than the control arm. They note lower condom use in one of the anonymous methods - I assume they could not compare between prep and non prep users. </p><p>5. LTFU rates were high (only about 60% were surveyed at follow up_- what could the effect of that be? Did it occur more in the unregistered FSWs. Is it possible that those with higher LTFU had more indebtedness and so may have been more willing to use condom less while on PrEP. </p><p>6. I notice condom use decreased over the prep period by 10pp potentially due to decreases in condom use. Could there also be population optimism about HIV that results in decreases in prep users and non-users. </p><p>7. Prep use can be very transient in FSWs - what did the authors find in terms of retention on PrEP. Is it possible to get this data from their survey or the providers? I assume only long term users would think about reducing condom use, so maybe the follow up here is too short?</p><p>8. Did an individuals perceived unlikelihood of getting HIV with Prep predict lower condom use in FSWs on PREP? </p><p>9. The authors state 'Anecdotally, a notable reduction in condom supplies of the MoH was observed after the introduction of PrEP, consistent with the increase in condom use found in the study.' Should it say decrease in condom use found in the study.</p><p>Any attachments provided with reviews can be seen via the following link: [LINK]</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------- ---</p><p>General editorial requests:</p><p>(Note: not all will apply to your paper, but please check each item carefully)</p><p>* We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement, making sure to declare all competing interests.

The responses and updates to the manuscript have resolved queries from my original review.</p><p>Changes to the primary outcome were made during the trial but before unblinding. A reasonable justification is given for this (from my perspective as a non-content expert), and a set of sensitivity analyses are completed that are consistent with the main results. </p><p>A sensitivity analyses weighting data with entropy weights is provided, weighting follow-up to baseline data, the results are consistent with the main results. </p><p>Reviewer #2: The authors have addressed all of my comments satisfactorily.</p><p>Reviewer #3: I appreciate the efforts that the authors took to address my comments. I do not have any follow up questions. Great job! </p><p>Reviewer #4: The author has thoughtfully responded to my comments. My only remaining comments are that it would be good to say how they added text in response to my comment 3 (about checking self reported data), and i still think the following sentence is not clear '"Anecdotally, a notable reduction in condom supplies of the MoH was observed after the introduction of PrEP, consistent with the increase in condom use among PrEP users found in the study'. Do they mean the MOH stocks of condoms reduced because of increased use of condom, or did they supply less each month but condom use still went up?</p><p>Any attachments provided with reviews can be seen via the following link:</p><p>[LINK]</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Requests from Editors:</p><p>GENERAL</p><p>* In trials, there is usually a distinction in the language in terms of causal vs associational for primary and secondary trial outcomes. It would be beneficial to use associational language in the discussion and other sections for secondary outcomes.</p><p>* Please ensure that all abbreviations are defined at first use throughout the text (including statistical abbreviations). Please also check figures and tables.</p><p>* Please review your text for claims of novelty or primacy (e.g. 'for the first time', &#8216;novel&#8217;) and remove this language.</p><p>* Please check that any use of statistical terms (such as trend or significant) are supported by the data, and if not please remove them.</p><p>* Please ensure that tables and figures, including those in supplementary files, are appropriately referenced in the main text.</p><p>* Statistical reporting: Please revise throughout the manuscript, including tables and figures.</p><p>a) Please report statistical information as follows to improve clarity for the reader "22% (95% CI [13%,28%]; p&lt;/=)". </p><p>b) Please separate upper and lower bounds with commas instead of hyphens as the latter can be confused with reporting of negative values. </p><p>c) Please define statistical definitions at first use and repeat the abbreviated definitions (HR, CI etc.) for each set of parentheses.</p><p>* Please avoid referring to the study participants as sample. Please re-place with cohort, participants or similar.</p><p>* We have noticed that in some tables the risk difference/effect estimate column is labeled as one or the other. Please review and use a consistent format.</p><p>* When presenting results, we suggest not repeating numerical results with range and/or intervals in the main text if these results can also be found in the corresponding tables and figures. We think that this would streamline the text.</p><p>* In general, we feel that the main text, especially the results section, is not always easy to follow. Please revise carefully for clarity and conciseness, and be sure to guide the reader through your results.</p><p>DATA AVAILABILITY</p><p>* Please include the DOI or accession number.</p><p>ABSTRACT</p><p>* Please confirm that your abstract complies with our requirements, including providing all the information relevant to this study type <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/submission-guidelines#loc-abstract" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/submission-guidelines#loc-abstract</ext-link>
</p><p>* Per CONSORT, please note that only the primary outcome of the trial should be reported in your Abstract. Secondary outcomes should only be included in the Abstract if all secondary outcomes are fully reported. For trials that have many secondary outcomes, the Abstract should be limited to reporting the primary outcome.</p><p>* In the last sentence of the Abstract Methods and Findings section, please describe the main limitation(s) of the study's methodology.</p><p>* Please ensure that all numbers presented in the abstract are present and identical to numbers presented in the main manuscript text.</p><p>* On line 44, we suggest writing &#8216;T&#8217; and &#8216;C&#8217; in full. </p><p>* ll.46ff: Because you are describing percentage points, which describe a difference between two percentages, the estimated effect should be either increasing or decreasing. Please rephrase and be sure to indicate if the results are not significant.</p><p>* Please note that you switch between "control group mean" and "reference mean". Do you always refer to the control group? If so, we recommend using the same description throughout.</p><p>* We have noted that you discuss short-term effects, but have not provided details on time points or time lines between referral and self-reported outcomes. What was the average time between referral and endline survey?</p><p>* l.50: "There were no notable effects on other risky behaviours." - since this statement refers to the secondary outcomes, we suggest using associational language (if not removed, see second comment under Abstract).</p><p>AUTHOR SUMMARY</p><p>* We suggest changing the second bullet point to (split into two):</p><p>1) Risk compensation may be more pronounced among female sex workers (FSWs), as condomless sex is better remunerated. </p><p>2) According to a literature search in January 2024, there is a lack of randomised controlled trials testing whether PrEP uptake impacts the prevalence of unprotected sex among FSWs. For men who have sex with men, the evidence was mixed, with more recent studies showing risk compensation.</p><p>* We feel that the statement, &#8220;To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence from a randomised experiment on whether PrEP causes compensatory risky sexual behaviour by FSWs.&#8221;, is somewhat repetitive of the statement on the literature search. We suggest removing it.</p><p>* l.92: We suggest removing the word &#8216;strong&#8217;.</p><p>* l.93: Again, we note that you discuss short-term effects, but have not provided details on time points or time lines between referral and self-reported outcomes.</p><p>* ll.93-95: &#8220;The data are consistent with users of oral PrEP believing that combined protection with condoms is more effective than using PrEP alone.&#8221; &#8211; as written, it is not clear whether this statement reflects another finding of your study or whether it is based on recent literature.</p><p>* l.98: &#8220;It is generally believed&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; is this based on scientific literature or scientific discourse among the research community?</p><p>* ll.100-103: We suggest creating a new bullet point for the statements starting &#8220;The evidence...&#8221; and ending &#8220;&#8230;in other setting&#8221;.</p><p>* ll.104-107: Are there any indicators that the belief on combined PrEP and condom use is changing? We are not sure whether this statement is really needed here.</p><p>* ll.107-109, we suggest changing to: Studies with longer follow-up are needed to evaluate behavioral responses. The study also demonstrates the difficulties of conducting a randomized controlled trial in this setting.</p><p>* Please note that the last bullet point should clearly state the main limitation(s).</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>* Please change the heading to &#8216;Introduction&#8217;.</p><p>METHODS AND RESULTS </p><p>* Please provide the approval numbers from both ethics committees. </p><p>* l.284: &#8220;sample of 500&#8221; &#8211; please change to: &#8220;We assumed a drop-out rate of 10% from the original study size of 500 individuals due to survey and sex work attrition,&#8230;&#8221;. </p><p>* ll.351-353: Please remove the &#8216;Role of the funding source&#8217; statement from the main text. These details should only be included in the metadata in the online submission form.</p><p>* ll.336-337: &#8220;number of days in the seven preceding the endline interview that were within Ramadan&#8221; &#8211; please briefly explain the reason for adjusting for days within Ramadan.</p><p>* Figure 1: Please define &#8216;PrEP&#8217;.</p><p>* l.367: We suggest including the total n-number here for clarity (n=308).</p><p>* l.382ff: Please clarify that these results refer to the total cohort.</p><p>* ll.387-392: In what table/figure can readers find these values? Please provide a reference.</p><p>Throughout, we feel it needs to be more clear when results are not significant (cross the null).</p><p>* l.394ff: We feel that it may be confusing to readers that you present risk differences (RD) in Table 2 while you continue to refer to "effect estimates" or "estimated effect" in the text. Also, in the table you present the risk difference as a decimal number, whereas in the text you present it as a percentage point. We feel that a consistent format (between tables/figures and text) would be preferable for the reader.</p><p>* l.397ff: &#8220;The point estimate corresponds to a 3.8% increase over the reference (control) group mean (84.9%)&#8221; &#8211; We are not sure whether we missed it, but have you provided the outcome mean values for the intervention group anywhere (equal to S5 Table for the reference group)? </p><p>* l.424ff: &#8220;The signs of the point estimates are consistent with PrEP referral and use both strengthening beliefs that use of a condom is effective in preventing HIV, although the 95% confidence intervals all include zero.&#8221; &#8211; We think that this statement is not 100% clear and that the interpretation of the direction of risk differences should not be part of the results section.</p><p>* l.431: &#8220;using the full range of perceived HIV risks&#8221; &#8211; please re-phrase and be more specific.</p><p>* l.431: "The direction of these differences is robust..." - although the linear interpretation yielded similar directions, the results were not significant, i.e. we would suggest toning down these findings.</p><p>* Tables: Please ensure to define all abbreviations used in tables and their descriptions, such as &#8216;PrEP&#8217;, &#8216;STI&#8217;, &#8216;CI&#8217;.</p><p>* Table 1: Is there a reason why you decided to report Share of XYZ as decimal numbers instead of percentages?</p><p>* Table 2: In the figure description, you write &#8220;See S4 Table for estimates obtained using all values of these outcomes&#8221;. We are not 100% sure what the sentence means and also noted that S4 Table shows the characteristics of analysis cohort in 2020 and at endline (2022). Please clarify.</p><p>* Table 3: &#8220;RDs were estimated as explained in notes to Table 2.&#8221; &#8211; please note that tables (and figures) should be self-explanatory on a standalone basis. Please repeat the explanation.</p><p>* Table 3: &#8220;See S5 Table for estimates with alternative specifications and estimators&#8221; &#8211; please check whether this is a correct reference. </p><p>DISCUSSION</p><p>* Please change the &#8216;Conclusions&#8217; heading to &#8216;Discussion&#8217;.</p><p>* Please remove any subheadings in the Discussion, including the Conclusion subheading.</p><p>* l.491: Please note that in the discussion new results should not be presented. Please present the results on associations of risky sexual behaviours with PrEP use to the Results section (including the reference to S10 Table).</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>General Editorial Requests</p><p>1) We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement.

</p><p>Dear Dr L&#233;pine,&#160;</p><p>On behalf of my colleagues and the Academic Editor, Matthias Egger, I am pleased to inform you that we have agreed to publish your manuscript "Effect of pre-exposure prophylaxis on risky sexual behaviour of female sex workers in Dakar, Senegal: A randomised controlled trial" (PMEDICINE-D-24-02342R4) in PLOS Medicine.</p><p>I appreciate your thorough responses to the comments from the reviewers and editors throughout the editorial process. Thank you for addressing our final concerns via email. We look forward to publishing your manuscript. As you know, editorially, there are a few points that still need to be addressed before publication. Please implement the final points in your manuscript as you addressed them in your email. We have outlined the requests once more below. We will carefully check whether the changes have been made. If you have any questions or concerns regarding these final requests, please feel free to contact me at atosun@plos.org.</p><p>Please see below the minor points that we request you respond to:</p><p>1) According to the trial protocol you have provided, some of the post-hoc secondary outcomes seem to overlap with the pre-specified secondary outcomes, including 'Number of occasional and regular clients seen in a fixed time frame, e.g. 7 days', 'Perceived HIV risk of clients', 'Type of sex acts with last two clients'. Are the post-hoc secondary outcomes defined as such because they focus on the last three clients, which deviates from the original protocol?</p><p>2) Please clarify whether the Zelen design was approved by the IRB as its design usually requires a waiver of the requirement for informed consent prior to random assignment of treatment.</p><p>3) Please provide the exact dates of randomization (beginning and end) and the exact dates of consenting (as the end date of consenting is ~equivalent to the last date of enrolment) in the Abstract and the Methods section.</p><p>4) Please note that although the protocol states "references," there are none.</p><p>5) In the Methods section of the manuscript, please clarify that you had permission to randomize the participants of the 2020 survey and who gave you that permission. Also, please clarify whether the participants were informed in 2020 that they might be contacted again in the future.</p><p>6) Data Availability: Thank you for providing the link. We understand that the link is still inactive at the moment. Please note that we can only publish the manuscript if it does not have a final, active DOI or accession number.</p><p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email (including the editorial requests above). Please be aware that it may take several days for you to receive this email; during this time no action is required by you. Once you have received these formatting requests, please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes.</p><p>In the meantime, please log into Editorial Manager at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/,</ext-link> click the "Update My Information" link at the top of the page, and update your user information to ensure an efficient production process.&#160;</p><p>PRESS</p><p>We frequently collaborate with press offices.
