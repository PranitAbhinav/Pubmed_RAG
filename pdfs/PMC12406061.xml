Two reviewers (B.C. and V.R) independently assessed and excluded articles without a study population, such as editorials, perspectives, commentaries, case reports, and certain literature reviews. Studies using artificial intelligence to predict outcomes or learn from datasets as well as articles reporting patient ancestry instead of race or ethnicity were excluded. An article using facial morphologic features to identify ethnicity was removed because the reported ethnicity was not comparable to other studies. Additionally, articles that used artificial intelligence&#8211;generated datasets were excluded because they lacked a comparable study population.</p><p>Articles were independently assessed by 2 reviewers (B.C. and V.R.) for the following variables based on key points from <italic toggle="yes">JAMA&#8217;s</italic> updated guidelines: inclusion of human participants; reporting of age, sex, gender, race and/or ethnicity, race and ethnicity as a single category, and measures of socioeconomic status (SES); location of race and ethnicity information (eg, Abstract, Methods section, Results section, tables, and supplement); demographic variables collected but not reported and the reason; whether race and ethnicity classifications were derived specifically for the study or were determined from historical data from past studies; who determined race and ethnicity and where this was noted in the article; source of race and/or ethnicity and location in the article; reason for collecting race and/or ethnicity categories and where this was mentioned in the article; number and order of racial and ethnic categories reported; whether the category &#8220;other&#8221; was included and if it was defined; whether race and/or ethnicity categories were listed in alphabetical order; whether race and/or ethnicity categories were capitalized; use of race and/or ethnicity categories as adjectives or nouns; use of the term &#8220;mixed race&#8221; for data collection and whether the specific races were defined; use of the terms &#8220;minority&#8221; or &#8220;minoritized&#8221; and whether a modifier such as &#8220;racial&#8221; or &#8220;ethnic&#8221; was included; inclusion of the terms &#8220;multiracial&#8221; or &#8220;multiethnic&#8221;; whether the specific races or ethnicities were defined and whether these terms were selected from a study database; and whether the terms &#8220;Arab&#8221; and &#8220;Arab American,&#8221; &#8220;Asian,&#8221; and &#8220;Asian American&#8221; were used interchangeably and whether the terms &#8220;African American&#8221; and &#8220;Black&#8221; were used interchangeably without defining both terms. The use of the term &#8220;Caucasian&#8221; to designate White individuals outside the Caucasus region was also recorded. Variables were determined based on <italic toggle="yes">JAMA&#8217;s</italic> updated race and ethnicity reporting guidelines.<sup><xref rid="zoi250842r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Discrepancies in data collection were resolved by 2 additional reviewers (K.D. and M.R.W.) in biweekly meetings as detailed in the following paragraph. SES indicators were defined as income, educational level, housing, health insurance, and employment. The categories &#8220;race/ethnicity&#8221; and &#8220;race and ethnicity&#8221; were considered equivalent. Articles reporting race/ethnicity as a combined category were not counted as reporting either race or ethnicity separately. If an article reported racial or ethnic information without specifying whether a category was classified as a race or ethnicity, reviewers determined the classification based on the Office of Management and Budget guidelines.<sup><xref rid="zoi250842r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi250842r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> When race or ethnicity data were collected specifically for the study, the outcome was classified as primary. When they were derived from past studies wherein the data were static after study completion, the outcome was classified as secondary. Studies that did not describe the details of data capture (eg, with electronic medical records wherein race and ethnicity are reported without clarifying whether classifications reflected patient self-identification or if predetermined categories were used) were coded as unspecified. When an individual&#8217;s country of origin was reported but their ethnicity was not explicitly stated, the outcome was not classified as reporting ethnicity information. If a study indicated that a variable was described in another section of the article, the recorded location was the section containing the listed data. Descriptions of the study design or methods that referenced prior publications were not recorded in our dataset. Race and ethnicity information estimated from population values were considered the same as reporting race and ethnicity of the study cohort. Articles listing race and/or ethnicity as demographic variables were counted as reporting race/ethnicity in that section of the article. The source, method of collection, and rationale for collecting race and ethnicity data were recorded when reported for all demographic variables or specifically for race and ethnicity information. If a rationale was provided for analyzing data by race and ethnicity categories, it was noted as the reason for collecting race and ethnicity variables. Articles categorizing race into underrepresented in medicine (URiM) and non-URiM groups were coded as reporting racial information if definitions of these groups were provided. The alphabetical order of racial and ethnic groups was based on category order, excluding the categories &#8220;other&#8221; and &#8220;unknown.&#8221; Alphabetical order within specific categories (eg, American Indian or Alaska Native) was not assessed. Racial descriptors used as nouns and adjectives were coded identically whether referring to the study population or discussing another article.

Although JAMA Network editors can enforce these standards during peer review, authors publishing in other journals may have limited awareness of the guidelines, and editorial oversight may differ by publication.
