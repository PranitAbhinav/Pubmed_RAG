Synapses play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain&#8211;containing protein 5 (SH2D5) is highly expressed in the brain and is implicated in the regulation of synaptic function. However, its role and mechanism in epilepsy remain unclear. In this study, we found that SH2D5 was predominantly localized to pyramidal neurons in the mouse hippocampus and was upregulated in the hippocampus of epileptic brains. KO of <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> in the hippocampus alleviated both the susceptibility to and severity of epileptic activity. Mechanistically, SH2D5 regulated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor&#8211;mediated (NMDAR&#8211;mediated) excitatory synaptic transmission by altering the protein expression levels of NMDAR subunits. We further demonstrated that SH2D5 modulated the transcription of NMDARs by promoting the autophagic degradation of STAT1. These findings suggest that targeting the SH2D5/STAT1/NMDAR pathway may offer a potential therapeutic strategy for epilepsy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p>

Although more than 20 antiseizure medications (ASMs) have been developed in the last 30 years, approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy still suffer from poor seizure control. Moreover, there are no ASMs capable of preventing epileptogenesis, which is a continuous process that begins before the onset of SRSs (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Epilepsy is thought to involve an imbalance of neuronal excitation and inhibition that originates from a local or general epileptic zone. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that many ASMs are membrane stabilizers that inhibit neural conduction, such as carbamazepine, topiramate, and lacosamide (sodium ion channel blockers), as well as synaptic transmission modulators, such as levetiracetam (binds synaptic vesicle protein 2A), valproate (elevates GABA), and perampanel (an &#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor [AMPAR] antagonist). Therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanism of synaptic transmission underlying epilepsy can facilitate the exploration of potential antiepileptic targets.</p><p>SH2D5 is an adaptor-like protein with a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain at its N-terminus and an SH2-like domain at its C-terminus (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Intracellular signal transduction relies on protein-protein interactions facilitated by specific domains, such as the SH2 and PTB domains, which recognize altered residues, such as phosphorylated tyrosine (P-Tyr) residues (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Proteins containing these domains often have additional interaction modules, enabling them to function as adapters and recruit signaling molecules to affect intracellular signaling cascades (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The Allen Brain Atlas revealed that SH2D5 is highly enriched within brain tissue at the transcriptional level (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The Human Protein Atlas revealed that SH2D5 is expressed mainly in brain and testis tissues. It is expressed mainly in neurons in regions of the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, amygdala, and basal ganglia (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Moreover, IHC assays revealed that, in the mouse brain, SH2D5 is enriched in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and in pyramidal cells in the cortex and hippocampus (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The distribution of SH2D5 underlies its presumed function in the brain. For example, a case-control study revealed that headache chronification is associated primarily with the methylation of SH2D5 at the CpG site (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD), SH2D5 was found to be 1 of 9 genes that were differentially expressed in the brain between patients with AD and controls (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>SH2D5 is enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This indicates that SH2D5 may play an important role in synaptic function. However, no studies have investigated the roles of SH2D5 in regulating synaptic transmission and in related diseases. Epilepsy is a disorder typically attributed to synaptic dysfunction. In our study, we found that SH2D5 was localized to neurons. SH2D5 was upregulated in the hippocampus in the epileptic brain, and <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> KO alleviated epileptic activity. Analysis of synaptic function revealed that SH2D5 regulated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor&#8211;mediated (NMDAR-mediated) excitatory synaptic transmission and the functional synapse number. Further mechanistic research revealed that SH2D5 modulated the autophagic degradation of STAT1 to affect the transcription of NMDARs. These results elucidate the role of SH2D5 in regulating epilepsy and the mechanism underlying this role.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>SH2D5 localization and expression in the epileptic brain.</title><p>To investigate the potential involvement of SH2D5 in epilepsy, we first assessed the localization of SH2D5 in epileptic brain tissues via immunofluorescence. To establish a typical epilepsy mouse model, kainic acid (KA) was used to induce status epilepticus (SE), followed by a latent period. In the hippocampi and cortex of mice with KA-induced epilepsy, SH2D5 colocalized primarily with the neuronal marker protein NeuN but not with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.191347DS1" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.191347DS1</ext-link>). In temporal lobe samples obtained from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) undergoing lesion resection, SH2D5 was also predominantly expressed in neurons (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>We also assessed the protein expression level of SH2D5 in epileptic brain tissues. SH2D5 protein expression in the hippocampus and cortex was elevated in mice with KA-induced epilepsy compared with control mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, C and E</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>, B and C). We also detected increased expression of SH2D5 in the temporal lobe tissues of patients with TLE compared with those of control patients who experienced traumatic brain injury (TBI) but did not exhibit epilepsy symptoms (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, D and F</xref>). Detailed information on the 2 groups of patients is included in <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 1</xref>. The change in SH2D5 expression in the epileptic brain indicates the potential involvement of SH2D5 in epilepsy.</p></sec><sec><title>Sh2d5 KO alleviates epileptic activity.</title><p>To investigate whether the upregulation of the SH2D5 protein contributes to the development of epilepsy, we examined its effect on epileptic activity in <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice. Homozygous <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were obtained through the breeding of heterozygous <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5<sup>fl/&#8211;</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The genotype was confirmed via PCR (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). To specifically knock out <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> in the neurons of the hippocampus, AAV-<italic toggle="yes">hSyn-Cre</italic> was injected into the hippocampi of <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. Three weeks later, Western blotting revealed a greater-than 50% reduction in SH2D5 expression in the <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, D and E</xref>).</p><p>A behavioral study was conducted on KA-induced epilepsy model and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling model to investigate the effect of SH2D5 on epilepsy development (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In the KA-induced epilepsy model, compared with control mice, <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice exhibited a prolonged latency to seizure onset and SE onset in the acute phase after KA administration (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, F and G</xref>). After SE onset, the brain is gradually functionally altered, leading to the generation of SRSs (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Epileptic seizures were monitored via video recording during the first 4 weeks after SE induction, and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded for 2 hours during the fifth week after SE induction (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Compared with the control group, the <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO group presented a prolonged latency to the first SRS and a reduced number of SRSs within 4 weeks (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, H and I</xref>). Moreover, LFP recording within 30 minutes revealed that <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice presented a significant reduction in both the duration and frequency of seizure-like events (SLEs) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, J&#8211;L</xref>). In addition, we confirmed the effect of <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> KO on epilepsy development in PTZ kindling model. The results revealed that <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> KO delayed seizure kindling (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> KO can reduce seizure susceptibility and alleviate epilepsy development.</p></sec><sec><title>SH2D5 regulates excitatory synaptic transmission and the number of functional synapses.</title><p>Epilepsy is thought to result from an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neural activity, as well as abnormalities in intrinsic neuronal excitability (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We utilized whole-cell patch-clamp recording to evaluate the activity of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region. Mg<sup>2+</sup> was removed from the extracellular solution of the hippocampal slices to induce seizure-like activity. We found that the resting membrane potential (RMP) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), action potential (AP) firing rate, and AP threshold (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, B&#8211;D</xref>) were unaltered in <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice, and this suggests that SH2D5 does not modulate intrinsic neuronal excitability. To elucidate the role of SH2D5 in synaptic transmission, we measured spontaneous postsynaptic currents. Our investigation revealed that the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were unaltered in <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, E&#8211;G</xref>). However, <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> KO led to a reduction in both the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, H&#8211;J</xref>). Our findings suggest that SH2D5 can regulate excitatory postsynaptic transmission.</p><p>Changes in sEPSC frequency are generally attributed to changes in neurotransmitter release or the number of functional synapses (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) is an indirect indicator of presynaptic release probability. We found that there was no difference in the PPR between the <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO and control groups (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, A and B</xref>). Moreover, we examined the number of functional excitatory synapses, which is correlated with parameters reflecting the morphology of dendritic spines, including the proportion of mature dendritic spines, dendritic complexity, and spine density. Golgi staining revealed that the density of dendritic spines was lower on hippocampal neurons in <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice than on those in control mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, C and D</xref>). We furtherly examined dendritic spine morphology on cultured primary neurons. Compared with those of control mice, the neurons of <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice exhibited not only a reduced density of dendritic spines but also significantly fewer stubby and mushroom-shaped spines, along with an increase in the number of filopodia-like protrusions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, E&#8211;G</xref>). These findings suggest that SH2D5 can modulate the number of functional synapses.</p></sec><sec><title>SH2D5 regulates NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission.</title><p>Hippocampal lysates from WT mice with KA-induced epilepsy were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using an anti-SH2D5 antibody, and interacting proteins were subsequently identified by IP&#8211;mass spectrometry (IP-MS) to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying SH2D5-mediated regulation of epileptic activity and synaptic transmission. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that the potential interacting proteins were enriched primarily in functions related to synaptic activity (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that the potential interacting proteins were associated with glutamatergic synapses (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). These findings support the electrophysiological findings that SH2D5 regulates excitatory synaptic transmission. Furthermore, to determine the type of excitatory synaptic receptor modulated by SH2D5, the protein levels of AMPAR and NMDAR subunits in epileptic hippocampal tissue were assessed. Western blotting demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> KO resulted in a significant decrease in the total protein levels of the GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B subunits in epileptic hippocampal tissue. However, <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> KO had no discernible effect on the total protein levels of AMPAR subunits (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, C and D</xref>). Furthermore, given that membrane proteins play roles in synaptic transmission, the membrane fraction of hippocampal samples was extracted, and the levels of synaptic receptor subunits were measured. NMDAR subunit expression in the membrane fraction of hippocampal tissues from <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice was reduced, whereas no significant change in AMPAR subunit expression was detected (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, E and F</xref>).

In total, 5,314 distinct proteins were identified. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the differentially expressed proteins were related to various pathways (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We specifically focused on the JAK/STAT pathway because numerous reports have highlighted its potential role in the transcriptional regulation of NMDARs (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). According to a volcano plot, the protein STAT1 of the JAK/STAT pathway was specifically differentially expressed between <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice and control mice (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). To confirm the interaction between SH2D5 and STAT1, we assessed their colocalization via fluorescence staining and their interactions via co-IP analysis (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>, A&#8211;C). Furthermore, as STAT1 has been reported to regulate the transcription of NMDARs (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), we examined the transcriptional levels of NMDARs. Similar to the Western blotting results shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, C and D</xref>, quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed a significant decrease in the mRNA level of NMDARs in <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice with epilepsy (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting that SH2D5 may modulate the transcription of NMDARs. Functionally, the protein levels of STAT1 and dimerized STAT1 were increased in the hippocampi of <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice with epilepsy (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, D and E</xref>). STAT3, a member of the STAT protein family, has been reported to regulate NMDAR transcription (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and is regulated by SH2D5 in hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). We also evaluated the expression of both total and phosphorylated STAT3 in <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO and control mice. No significant differences in total STAT3 protein, p-705-STAT3, or p-727-STAT3 levels were observed (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, F and G</xref>). These findings indicate that SH2D5 may be involved in NMDAR transcription through STAT1.</p><p>To further confirm that STAT1 functionally participates in the regulation of epilepsy by SH2D5, we performed a rescue experiment in which STAT1 was inhibited with fludarabine. We found that i.p. injection of fludarabine resulted in a significant increase in the protein expression of NMDARs in the hippocampi of <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice with KA-induced epilepsy (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, H and I</xref>). A behavioral study revealed that <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice treated with fludarabine presented a shorter latency to seizure onset, SE onset, and the first SRS (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, J&#8211;L</xref>) and an increased number of SRSs (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M</xref>) than did those treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). LFP analysis of mice with KA-induced epilepsy revealed that <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice treated with fludarabine presented significant increases in the frequency of SLEs and the duration of SLEs (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, N&#8211;P</xref>). In the PTZ kindling epilepsy model, the epileptic activity of the mice in the fludarabine group was greater than that of the mice in the control group (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6Q</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that STAT1 plays an important role in the regulation of epileptic activity by SH2D5.</p></sec><sec><title>SH2D5-mediated autophagy modulates the expression of STAT1.</title><p>As shown above, <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> KO upregulated STAT1 protein expression levels; therefore, we next explored the mechanism by which SH2D5 regulates STAT1 protein levels. We first investigated whether SH2D5 regulates the mRNA expression of STAT1 in brain tissue from epileptic mice via qPCR. The absence of SH2D5 did not significantly affect the mRNA level of STAT1 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Next, we investigated the effect of SH2D5 on the posttranscriptional stability of STAT1. Primary hippocampal neurons from <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were transfected with <italic toggle="yes">AAV-hSyn-Cre</italic>. A cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay was used to assess the stability of STAT1. Our results revealed that <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> KO significantly prolonged the half-life of STAT1 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7, B and C</xref>), indicating that SH2D5 may regulate STAT1 protein degradation. To confirm these results, we investigated the degradation of STAT1 by the 2 most common degradation pathways &#8212; the ubiquitination and lysosomal pathways. We observed that chloroquine (CQ; a lysosomal inhibitor) significantly increased STAT1 protein levels, whereas the administration of MG132 (a ubiquitination inhibitor) did not (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). In addition, <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> KO decreased the levels of the autophagy-related protein Beclin1 and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7, E, F, H, and I</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining also revealed a significant reduction in the mean fluorescence intensity of LC3 relative to that of NeuN in the hippocampal CA1 region in <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). A rescue experiment in which <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice were treated with the autophagy agonist RAPA revealed a notable reduction in the protein level of STAT1 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7, J and K</xref>) and a significant increase in the protein expression of NMDARs (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7, L and M</xref>), which further confirmed the role of SH2D5 in regulating autophagy. To date, the mechanism of SH2D5 regulating autophagy has not been reported. Previous studies have shown that knockdown of SH2D5 reduced the level of RAC1-GTPase (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and others have suggested that autophagy can be increased through the RAC1 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Therefore, we checked the role of RAC pathway agonist SEW2871 in <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic>-KO mice. We found that SEW2871 significantly increased the LC3II/LC3I ratio and the expression level of Beclin1 in the hippocampal tissue, whereas it reduced the level of STAT1 protein (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>, D&#8211;G). Taken together, these findings suggest that SH2D5 regulates STAT1 expression via the modulation of autophagy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study investigated the role of SH2D5 in epilepsy and the mechanisms underlying this role. Our findings show that SH2D5 is mainly localized in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Using <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice and <italic toggle="yes">hSyn-Cre</italic> AAV, we selectively knocked out <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> in adult neurons. Neuronal <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> KO reduced the severity of SRSs and seizure susceptibility. IP-MS and LC&#8211;MS/MS analyses identified STAT1 as a key downstream target of SH2D5. SH2D5 was found to regulate the transcriptional repression of Grin1, Grin2a, and Grin2b by controlling STAT1 degradation via selective autophagy. KO of <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> increased STAT1 levels, inhibited NMDAR transcription, and alleviated epilepsy symptoms, while inhibiting STAT1 worsened seizures. These results provide additional insights into the role of SH2D5 in epilepsy.</p><p>We verified via whole-cell patch-clamp recording that the deletion of SH2D5 had an effect on sEPSCs. We used IP-MS to identify proteins whose expression is modulated by SH2D5 in the context of epilepsy and revealed that SH2D5 interacts with a multitude of synapse-associated proteins, particularly those in the glutamatergic synaptic pathway. AMPARs and NMDARs are the predominant types of glutamate receptors responsible for transmitting signals from presynaptic neurons to postsynaptic neurons, and their localization, function, and abundance are tightly regulated (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Changes in their expression and function are closely linked to epilepsy (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In our study, we observed a significant decrease in the levels of NMDAR proteins (GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B) in both the total fraction and the membrane fraction of hippocampal tissue following <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> KO. These findings suggest that the modulation of NMDAR protein expression by SH2D5 could have an effect on synaptic activity in epilepsy.</p><p>NMDARs are crucial for mediating synaptic transmission and plasticity (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Deletion of SH2D5 did not result in significant changes in the PPR but did alter the number and complexity of dendritic spines, suggesting that the probability of presynaptic glutamate release was unchanged but that synaptic remodeling was altered in epilepsy. As functional excitatory synapses are predominantly located at dendritic spines (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), the number of excitatory synapses is associated with the morphology of dendritic spines, including the proportion of mature dendritic spines, dendritic spine complexity, and spine density. Therefore, SH2D5 modulates the function of excitatory synapses by altering the morphology of dendritic spines, affecting behavior and epileptiform-related phenotypes in epileptic mice, which is consistent with the findings obtained from patch-clamp recordings.</p><p>Our findings suggest that STAT1 is the key gene regulated by SH2D5 in mice with epilepsy. The STAT family consists of 7 members, specifically STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT6 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These proteins play pivotal roles in regulating fundamental physiological processes, such as growth, division, and apoptosis (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Under physiological conditions, STAT1 is present in an inactive state within the cytoplasm. Upon activation by cytokines or growth factors, STAT1 undergoes dimerization and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to modulate gene transcription (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Subsequently, activated STAT1 can directly bind to NMDAR promoters to repress NMDAR expression (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). STAT3, another member of the STAT protein family, has been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of epilepsy (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Moreover, STAT3 increases NMDAR transcription through direct binding to a specific Gamma-activated site (GWS) in NMDAR promoters (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). STAT3 is primarily activated via phosphorylation at the tyrosine 705 (Y705) or serine 727 (S727) residue (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, no significant changes in the protein levels of STAT3, p-STAT3-705, or p-STAT3-727 were detected. Finally, we confirmed a significant increase in NMDAR expression following the administration of the STAT1 inhibitor fludarabine, indicating that SH2D5 regulates NMDAR expression through STAT1.</p><p>The maintenance of protein homeostasis and the regulatory mechanisms involved in protein synthesis and degradation are essential for the normal functioning of the central nervous system (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Autophagy, a crucial process for the clearance of abnormal proteins, plays dual roles in various diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, ischemic stroke, and epilepsy (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Our experimental results also confirmed that SH2D5-mediated autophagy is responsible for the degradation of the STAT1 protein. Owing to the limited research on the function of the SH2D5 protein, there are no reports regarding the association between SH2D5 and autophagy. However, numerous proteins containing SH2 domains are capable of modulating autophagy levels. For example, methyl vinyl ketone can modulate autophagy by binding to the SH2 domain of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), and the SH2 supercomplex has been reported to inhibit autophagy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). However, our results indicate that <italic toggle="yes">Sh2d5</italic> KO negatively regulates autophagy, which is contrary to previously reported effects. Therefore, we speculate that, in the hippocampi of epileptic mice, SH2D5 may not directly regulate autophagy through its SH2 domain. Additionally, studies have shown that knockdown of SH2D5 reduced the level of RAC1-GTPase (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and that RAC1 affects autophagy (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The level of autophagy was significantly increased after the use of RAC pathway agonists, while the level of STAT1 protein was significantly decreased. These results further support the hypothesis that SH2D5 may regulate autophagy through the RAC1 signaling pathway, thereby regulating STAT1 protein levels.</p><p>These studies indicate a potential association between the expression of SH2D5 and the process of autophagy. Finally, we demonstrated through rescue experiments that the level of the STAT1 protein was significantly reduced and that the protein levels of NMDARs were significantly elevated following the administration of the autophagy agonist RAPA. These findings suggest that reliance on SH2D5-mediated neuronal autophagy contributes to accelerating the onset of epilepsy.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that SH2D5 regulates autophagy in hippocampal neurons in the brain, thereby modulating the expression of STAT1 and subsequently influencing the transcription of NMDARs, ultimately affecting epilepsy-related behavioral phenotypes. These observations provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of epilepsy and identify potential targets for therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sex as a biological variable.</title><p>The human brain samples used in this work were collected from male and female individuals (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 1</xref>).
