This case report describes a retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma that encircled and invaded the inferior vena cava, as both CT-enhanced CTA of the whole abdomen and enhanced MRI of the upper abdomen suggested that the iliac vein converged into the abnormally thick left ovarian vein, which in turn communicated with the inferior vena cava through the left renal vein, providing the basis for the complete resection of the retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma together with a part of the invaded inferior vena cava. Even if the retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma invades the left renal vein, reconstruction can still be performed using the unaffected right renal vein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Reconstruction of the inferior vena cava is performed in routine surgical operations and requires a high level of surgical skill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, inferior vena cava graft replacement also requires postoperative anticoagulation, which has a greater impact on patients&#8217; quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Case report</title><p id="Par6">A 75-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital with right lower abdominal pain for 2 years, which worsened for 2 months. The patient had no underlying disease, such as hypertension or diabetes. The patient was in a state of baseline health with no history of surgery or trauma, had harmonious family relationships, and had no abnormalities in psychosocial or genetic history. Preoperative CT enhancement of the whole abdomen combined with CTA suggested that the retroperitoneal mass, preliminarily considered to be a malignant leiomyosarcoma and metastatic tumor to be drained, contained a mixed plaque in the abdominal aorta and both iliac arteries with mild luminal stenosis, the inferior vena cava (below the renal plane) was unclear, the pelvic veins were varicose, and the iliac veins were converging into the ovarian veins (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and b). Moreover, an MRI-enhanced scan (3.0T) of the upper abdomen also revealed a retroperitoneal mass, and the possibility of leiomyosarcoma originating from the wall of the inferior vena cava was considered high (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c and d). Because the patient&#8217;s retroperitoneal tumor was first considered to have a high likelihood of leiomyosarcoma at the imaging level, further puncture under CT localization was subsequently performed to obtain pathological results for verification, and then, adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of adriamycin (75&#160;mg/m&#178;) and dacarbazine (200&#160;mg/m&#178;) was applied once every 3 weeks for a total of 4 cycles of treatment. According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5, the patient tolerated chemotherapy without grade 2 or higher adverse events, and tumor shrinkage after chemotherapy reduced the chance of recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The patient was supine on the CT room machine tool operating table. On the basis of the predetermined skin puncture point area of the retroperitoneal mass on CT scan, routine disinfection and laying of towels and 2% lidocaine local infiltration anesthesia were performed; the needle was penetrated with an 18G puncture needle and fine-tuned to the clear position of a good exit of the core of the needle with a disposable biopsy needle, 3 strips of 2.3&#160;cm of tissue were taken for examination, the needle was removed, and local compression was applied. After the operation and re-examination of the CT image, there was no obvious bleeding. The patient was instructed to return to the ward and take bed rest. Combined with the preoperative imaging examination, the preoperative retroperitoneal mass puncture biopsy suggested soft tissue sarcoma with necrosis, and leiomyosarcoma was first considered. Immunohistochemical staining revealed CD34 (-), CD117 (-), ER (-), Ki-67 (30%+), desmin (+), Dog-1 (-), P16 (strong +), P53 (70% strong +), PR (-) and S-100 (-) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>j). Postoperative analgesia, antiemetics, and nutritional support were given for symptomatic treatment, and subsequent surgical resection of retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma was proposed. The above conditions and treatment were communicated to the patient, who agreed with the plan.</p><p id="Par7">Resection of the retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma combined with resection of the inferior vena cava lesions was performed as follows. After successful anesthesia, routine disinfection, laying of towels, and disinfection of the range from the upper level of the nipple down to the level of the inguinal ligament were performed, the abdominal incision was made in the middle of the abdomen, the length of the subxiphoid process up to the umbilicus was extended, a layer-by-layer incision of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and the anterior sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle was made to open the white line of the abdomen, abdominal separation of the rectus abdominis muscle into the abdominal cavity was performed to explore the abdominal cavity of the internal organs, and no abnormalities were observed in the intra-abdominal cavity. The intestinal tube was placed on the left side of the abdominal cavity, and the distal posterior peritoneum was opened at the level of the small omental hole in the descending segment of the duodenum to the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta. A retroperitoneal mass of approximately 6.5*5.0&#160;cm in size and hardness was observed, with its upper margins below the renal veins bilaterally and its lower edge at the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta, which completely encircled and occluded the inferior vena cava, and its left edge partially covered the right side of the abdominal aorta, with an area of up to 2/3 circumferential diameter. The mass was completely free from the left edge of the abdominal aorta (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e), while the lumbar artery, inferior mesenteric artery and the beginning of the right paranephric artery were given titanium clips to clamp and suture, and then the right edge of the mass was separated. The right ureter was protected (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f), the posterior wall of the mass was completely free from the inferior vena cava at both ends of the mass, and the blocking bands were placed on the mass to cut off the distal vena cava of the mass, and the distal part was sutured (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g). The proximal part of the vein was closed at the distal part of the opening of both renal veins, and the mass was completely resected (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h). The traumatic edge of the tumor was hemostated via an electroknife and ultrasonic knife, the local area was infiltrated and soaked with distilled water, and titanium clips were used to mark the extent of the tumor during the operation to position the tumor for late radiotherapy. The postoperative pathology report of the retroperitoneal tumor suggested a soft tissue tumor with necrosis, and combined with immunohistochemical staining, it was consistent with leiomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemical staining revealed SMA (+), desmin (+), caldesmon (+), cyclin D1 (-), P53 (80% strong +), Ki-67 (40% +), ER (-), PR (-), CD10 (partially +), CD34 (-), P16 (strong +), S-100 (-), CD117 (-), and Dog &#8722;&#8201;1(-) (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>k).</p><p id="Par8">The patient was in stable condition 1 week after the operation, with no obvious pain in the right lower abdominal pain area after the operation and no edema in either lower limb. The patient needs to continue fasting and water restriction, intravenous nutritional support, acid suppression, protein supplementation, anti-infection, anticoagulation, and other symptomatic treatments in the early stage of the postoperative period. In addition, postoperative CT scanning&#8201;+&#8201;enhancement of the whole abdomen suggested postoperative changes in the posterior peritoneum, fluid exudative shadows in the operative area, trace pneumoperitoneum, and abdominopelvic wall edema; compared with the preoperative images, the pneumoperitoneum and exudative changes were significantly reduced. Additionally, varicose veins of the pelvic cavity and ovaries were observed (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>i). In addition, there were no complications, such as incision infection, peritonitis, abdominal abscess, retroperitoneal lymphatic leakage, intestinal obstruction, intestinal adhesion, cardiac infarction, cerebral infarction, or renal failure, in the patient 2 weeks after surgery.</p><p id="Par9">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par12">The clinical management of retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma (RPLS) invading and encircling the inferior vena cava (IVC) involves complex diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Owing to the complexity of the retroperitoneal anatomy and the insidious nature of the early symptoms of the tumor, such as nonspecific abdominal pain or bloating, patients often present to the clinic with advanced disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is also important to distinguish it from other malignant tumors in the retroperitoneum, such as liposarcoma or adrenal tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. When the tumor invades the inferior vena cava, patients may present with more severe symptoms, such as lower extremity edema or thrombosis, which may lead to misdiagnosis or delayed treatment. Imaging tests such as CT and MRI play important roles in assessing the extent of the tumor and its relationship with surrounding structures and resectibility is presented as a procedural aspect of the therapeutic approach. In imaging evaluation, 3.0T MRI significantly improves the ability to show anatomical details of retroperitoneal tumors by virtue of higher magnetic field strength, especially for the assessment of tumor boundaries, internal structures (e.g., necrosis, hemorrhage), and peripheral vascular invasion, better than that of conventional imaging methods (e.g., CT or low-field strength MRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The detection rate of vascular invasion by tumors via 3.0T MRI is 88%, which is significantly higher than that via CT (65%). Moreover, the sensitivity for malignant tumors was 92%, and the specificity was 85%. Thus, 3.0T MRI may have an accuracy of 90% in predicting surgical resectability, which is significantly better than that of CT (70%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Histopathology remains the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis, but puncture biopsy may cause needle tract metastasis, and the risk of metastasis is related to puncture access, with a lower risk of diffusion through the posterior approach than through abdominal puncture, so it needs to be performed with caution under image guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In view of the above analysis, this study further demonstrated the significance of the diagnosis of retroperitoneal smooth muscle sarcoma by 3.0T MRI and clarified the resection boundaries for subsequent surgical operations.</p><p id="Par13">For the treatment of retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma, complete resection is currently considered the only approach with curative potential. During surgery, if the tumor is found to have invaded the inferior vena cava, appropriate revascularization is required to ensure blood flow and reduce postoperative complications. In Mahesh Goelde&#8217;s study, 29% of patients required inferior vena cava (IVC) reconstruction, with a median follow-up of 25 months, median overall survival (OS) of 40 months, and median progression-free survival (DFS) of 28 months&#8212;findings that demonstrate improved perioperative morbidity, mortality, and oncologic outcomes compared to reference standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The management of the IVC after tumor resection depends on the location and size of the tumor. R0 resection provides an opportunity for long-term survival. For partial IVC involvement, if collateral circulation, such as dilated lumbar and odd venous systems, is adequately established, only IVC ligation can be performed without reconstruction, and the incidence of postoperative lower limb edema is low. However, in patients with complete occlusion of the IVC or involvement of the confluent segment of the hepatic vein, the one-stage patency rate of autologous access at 6 and 18 months was significantly higher than that of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts, with 72% vs. 58% (at 6 months) and 51% vs. 33% (at 18 months), respectively, and long-term patency of the autologous access was superior, with 77% at 18 months, compared with that of PTFE grafts, with only 55% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In recent years, laparoscopic and robotic-assisted techniques have been progressively applied to retroperitoneal tumor resection, but their safety in cases of IVC invasion still needs to be validated in large samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this study, preoperative imaging confirmed that the ability of the left ovarian vein to establish communication between the left renal vein and the left iliac vein effectively prevented inferior vena cava reconstruction and provided the basis for complete resection of retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma. On one hand, the left renal vein is not directly affected by the tumor in its lumen or opening, allowing normal blood flow to return to the inferior vena cava, and left renal perfusion is not significantly impacted; on the other hand, although the right renal vein directly drains into the inferior vena cava, the tumor is located below the renal vein and does not obstruct its opening, thus maintaining smooth blood flow in the right kidney. In summary, the blood supply to both kidneys was not affected. Furthermore, based on preoperative imaging and preoperative examinations, the patient did not exhibit any renal function abnormalities or significant lower limb edema, indicating that the current tumor&#8217;s impact on the hemodynamics of both kidneys is still in a compensatory stage. Based on preoperative imaging confirming that the large left ovarian vein drains into the left renal vein instead of the inferior vena cava, this case underwent complete resection of the peritoneal leiomyosarcoma combined with the inferior vena cava lesion, without the need for vascular reconstruction. This strategy is consistent with the direct resection technique reported by Raval et al. for IVC leiomyosarcoma combined with abundant lumbar venous collateral circulation, avoiding complex vascular reconstruction or extracorporeal circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Based on the literature evidence, the return of the right gonadal vein relies on the establishment of a longitudinal collateral pathway through the lumbar ascending vein-azygos vein system, while the expansion of the lumbar venous plexus forms a transverse &#8220;venous bridge.&#8221; Together, these mechanisms achieve blood flow compensation after inferior vena cava obstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. And it differs from cases where allograft reconstruction of the IVC is required (e.g., when there are insufficient collateral pathways) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Long-term hemodynamic stability is reflected by the absence of lower limb edema and a symptomatic thrombosis incidence rate of less than 18% post-surgery, confirming the effectiveness of the anatomical compensatory mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, precise preoperative assessment of venous collateral pathways is key to achieving safe radical treatment.This technique can subsequently be further combined with robotic technology to achieve precise resection of the tumor and reduce the incidence of postoperative lower extremity edema.</p><p id="Par14">Although surgery is the mainstay of treatment, the role of adjuvant therapy remains controversial owing to the poor response of such tumors to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In recent years, adjuvant treatments for retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma, especially chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy, have been significantly developed. For example, studies in recent years have shown that the application of targeted therapy in leiomyosarcoma has gradually increased, especially in the detection of gene mutations and individualized treatment, indicating good prospects. The combination of anti-VEGF drugs (e.g., bevacizumab) with chemotherapy increased the objective remission rate (ORR) to 28% compared with 12% with single-agent chemotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with targeted agents (e.g., lenvatinib) can synergistically suppress the immunosuppressive microenvironment with a disease control rate (DCR) of 68% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition, regimens using combination chemotherapy have been shown to improve patient prognosis in some clinical trials, although their efficacy varies among patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For the assessment of the efficacy of adjuvant therapy, the available literature shows that patients treated with novel adjuvant therapies have demonstrated significant improvements in both survival and recurrence rates. For example, by using novel drugs in combination with conventional chemotherapy, the resistance of tumors to chemotherapy can be overcome to a certain extent, and the effectiveness of treatment can be improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, the improvement in efficacy is accompanied by an increase in potential side effects, such as myelosuppression and gastrointestinal reactions, which need to be effectively managed and monitored in the clinic to minimize the impact on patients&#8217; quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, postoperative monitoring and follow-up are particularly important for detecting recurrence or metastasis in time. In terms of prognosis, IVC invasion is an independent poor prognostic factor for RPLS, and given that LVC repair and reconstruction can be performed, thrombi can persist for 3 months postoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. One study reported a combined lung/liver metastasis rate of 40&#8211;50% at recurrence of retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma, with an OS of 2.8 years after surgical resection for those with localized recurrence alone (vs. 1.5 years for those with metastases). The results of the multifactorial analysis suggested that R0 resection significantly prolonged OS (HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.6, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.01); a recurrence interval greater than 12 months increased OS by 50% compared with earlier recurrence (HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.5, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.003); and a tumor size greater than 10&#160;cm was associated with decreased OS (HR&#8201;=&#8201;1.9, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.03) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In leiomyosarcomas, high expression of SMA, Desmin, and caldesmon is correlated with better tumor differentiation, improved chemotherapy response, and prolonged survival, whereas strong P53 positivity (&gt;&#8201;50%) and Ki-67&#8201;&gt;&#8201;40% indicate aggressive behavior, chemoresistance, and reduced overall survival (OS). Loss of myogenic markers (SMA/Desmin/Caldesmon) worsens prognosis, whereas myofibroblast marker expression (18.4% of cases) is associated with longer median survival and enhanced chemotherapy efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A Ki-67 score&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;40% predicts poor postoperative outcomes (1-/3-/5-year OS: 86%, 46%, 28%), heightened chemotherapy sensitivity, and greater metastatic risk (75% developed lung metastases despite gemcitabine-based therapy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For patients with metastatic disease, there were no differences in OS according to chemotherapy regimens. However, eribulin and P53 activation improved progression-free survival (PFS), whereas TP53 mutations shortened OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. CD10(+) suggests mixed differentiation but has no prognostic impact, whereas diffuse p16 is linked to recurrence risk and reduced OS, although high p16 may enhance the response to amlotinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Combined with the above literature, the chemotherapeutic regimen in this study is efficacious in shrinking retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma, although screening of chemotherapy-sensitive populations by genetic testing (e.g., TP53 mutation, Ki-67 index) may further alleviate patients&#8217; clinical symptoms and improve their postoperative survival rate.</p><p id="Par15">The strategy of first using chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and then performing complete resection of the tumor along with the invaded inferior vena cava is crucial in this case. It adheres to the core principle of radical surgery as the only potential curative method and avoids the risk of vascular reconstruction by relying on sufficient collateral venous compensation. Achieved a precise balance between efficacy and trauma for the patient, controlling the tumor at minimal cost, and providing a replicable practice model for the radical treatment of retroperitoneal sarcoma.</p><p id="Par16">Retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma remains challenging due to its complexity, frequent inferior vena cava invasion, and late diagnosis. Imaging guides early detection, and surgery is the primary treatment. Future studies must optimize strategies to improve outcomes. This report&#8217;s single-case design highlights the need for broader validation to refine surgical and therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par17">This case highlights the rare and aggressive nature of retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma, a malignancy often diagnosed late with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. A novel surgical approach for tumors invading the IVC is proposed. The IVC was reconstructed by rerouting blood flow through the left ovarian vein to connect the left renal and iliac veins. This technique reduces surgical complexity and risks. To address the clinical challenges of retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma, recommendations include adopting this bypass strategy, prioritizing early detection by imaging or biopsy, fostering multidisciplinary collaboration, and promoting global case sharing to refine treatment protocols and advance research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
