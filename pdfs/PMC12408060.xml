The 5 East Asian countries (China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and Mongolia) represent one of the most significant regions globally in terms of GC burden.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The goal of this study is to examine the patterns and trends of GC across 5 East Asian countries between 1990 and 2021.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We retrieved data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2021 regarding the prevalence, incidence, mortality, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with GC in 5 East Asian countries from 1990 to 2021. We further assessed the burden of GC according to age and sex. We used decomposition analysis to examine the changes in the number of new cases, patients, and deaths related to GC. We also used Joinpoint (Joinpoint Regression Program, Version 5.1.0) and age-period-cohort analysis methods to interpret the epidemiological characteristics of GC. Autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) prediction models were used to forecast the GC burden by 2036.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Among the 5 East Asian countries, China recorded the highest incidence, prevalence, death, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs in both 1990 and 2021. From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized rates for prevalence, mortality, incidence, YLDs, YLLs, and DALYs across the 5 East Asian countries showed an overall decline, though they remained higher than the global average. In all 5 East Asian countries, individuals aged 65 years and older consistently exhibited the highest rates for prevalence, incidence, mortality, YLDs, YLLs, and DALYs. The prevalence rate in South Korea, the incidence rate in North Korea and Mongolia, and the mortality rate in China are influenced by aging, surpassing the global aging average.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The disease burden of GC in the 5 East Asian countries has consistently ranked high over the past 3 decades, particularly among the older individuals. The burden of GC in the 5 East Asian countries is expected to present a major public health challenge, primarily driven by the large population size and the aging demographic.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>gastric cancer</kwd><kwd>disease burden</kwd><kwd>global burden of disease study</kwd><kwd>epidemiological study</kwd><kwd>joinpoint regression analysis</kwd><kwd>age-period-cohort analysis</kwd><kwd>prediction model</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2022, gastric cancer (GC) accounted for 4.9% of all cancer cases, making it the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer globally [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths, accounting for 6.8% of all cancer fatalities [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The incidence rate of GC remains high [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], particularly in Asian countries such as China [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It presents a significant challenge for both prevention and treatment, posing a serious threat to the life and health of affected individuals [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The 5 East Asian countries&#8212;China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and Mongolia&#8212;together account for about 22% of the global population and approximately 24% of the world&#8217;s gross domestic product (GDP) [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The 5 East Asian countries share similar geographical locations, cultural influences, and dietary and lifestyle habits. Their traditional medicines, including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and traditional Mongolian medicine, have complemented Western medicine effectively [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>However, the existing GC registries remain insufficient, and epidemiological reports from the 5 East Asian countries are limited. The 2021 Global Burden of Diseases (GBD), Injuries, and Risk Factors Study performed a cause-of-death analysis, estimating mortality rates and years of life lost for 288 different causes of death [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This analysis categorized data based on age, sex, and location across 204 countries and regions, as well as 811 subnational areas, covering the period from 1990 to 2021 [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the disease burden of GC in 5 East Asian countries from 1990 to 2021, examining key metrics such as prevalence, incidence, mortality, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). We also use the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) models to predict the disease burden of GC to 2036. The aim of this study is to provide key insights that will assist decision-makers in assessing the overall burden of GC across the 5 East Asian countries. This, in turn, will support the formulation of targeted prevention strategies and help ensure the equitable distribution of public health resources.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data Source</title><p>The Global Health Data Exchange GBD Results Tool was used to collect data spanning from 1990 to 2021. The GBD platform provides access to all age-standardized and age-specific rates, along with data that includes 95% uncertainty intervals. Potential issues with GBD data include variability in data quality across countries and years, which can affect comparability. Some regions have limited or incomplete health data, leading to reliance on statistical estimates and models that introduce uncertainty. In addition, differences in data collection methods and reporting standards may impact the accuracy and consistency of results. These factors should be considered when interpreting GBD findings.</p><p>We retrieved data from the GBD 2021 regarding the prevalence, incidence, mortality, YLDs, YLLs, and DALYs associated with GC of all ages in 5 East Asian countries (China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and Mongolia) from 1990 to 2021.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Definition</title><p>In this study, we categorized all cancers coded as C16.902, following the <italic toggle="yes">International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">ICD-10</italic>), as GC.

It highlights significant epidemiological trends and regional disparities, which are essential for guiding public health policies and optimizing resource allocation. Our findings indicate that China recorded the highest number of incidence, prevalence, death, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs among the 5 East Asian countries in both 1990 and 2021. From an age perspective, in 2021, the age group with the highest prevalence numbers, incidence numbers, mortality numbers, YLD numbers, YLL numbers, and DALY numbers of females and males in the 5 East Asian countries was consistently those aged 55 and older. The age group with the highest prevalence rate, incidence rate, mortality rate, YLDs rate, YLLs rate, and DALYs rate in 5 East Asian countries was consistently those aged 65 years and older. The prevalence rate in South Korea was influenced by aging, surpassing global averages. The incidence rate in North Korea and Mongolia was influenced by aging and exceeds global averages. The mortality rate in China was influenced by aging, surpassing global averages. All of these factors indicate a significant disease burden on the older population.</p><p>In 1990, Japan had the highest ASPR among the 5 East Asian countries, but South Korea had the highest ASPR in 2021. In 1990, South Korea had the highest ASIR, and Japan had the highest age-standardized YLDs rate among the 5 East Asian countries, but Mongolia reported the highest ASIR and age-standardized YLDs rate in 2021. Mongolia also exhibited the highest ASMR, age-standardized YLLs rate, and ASDR among the 5 East Asian countries in both 1990 and 2021. The ASPR, ASIR, ASMR, age-standardized YLDs rate, age-standardized YLLs rate, and ASDR of the 5 East Asian countries demonstrated an overall downward trend from 1990 to 2021, but still higher than the global level. The AAPCs of ASPR, ASIR, ASMR, age-standardized YLDs rate, age-standardized YLLs rate, and ASDR in North Korea and Mongolia were above the global level. We used the ARIMA and BAPC models to project trends up to 2036. The ASIR and ASMR of Mongolia are predicted to be top 1 among 5 East Asian countries, while the ASPR of South Korea is predicted to be the highest. GC poses a substantial disease burden in 5 East Asian countries, particularly in China, Japan, South Korea, and Mongolia.</p><p>Gastrointestinal cancers account for nearly one-third of global cancer mortality [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. GC demonstrated decreasing trends specifically in females from 2000 to 2019, but still at a high level [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The infection-noncommunicable disease pair with the largest burden was GC due to <italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic> [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The global incidence and mortality rates of both young- and late-onset GC have decreased since 1990, but the incidence rate of young-onset cancer has demonstrated a small but significant upward trend since 2015 [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. From 1990 to 2019, the global incidence and mortality rates of GC declined in both sexes, across most GBD regions and countries, but the GC burden was still heavy in some GBD regions and countries, particularly within special age-specific groups [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In 2019, tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL), esophageal, stomach, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer were the top 5 neoplasms attributable to tobacco smoking, with different burdens in regions as per their development status [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The burden of stomach cancer worldwide, adjusted for age and related to smoking, has shown a decline from 1990 to 2019, but regional disparities have been identified, with some areas experiencing an increase in this burden [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. ASIR and ASMR of GC in the total population, different regions, and countries in Asia from 1990 to 2019 showed an overall decreasing trend [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A study has found out that the GC burden attributed to high sodium intake still exists seriously and varies remarkably by regions, sex, and age across China [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although the predicted age-standardized rates of mortality and DALYs due to dietary GC show downward trends, the absolute numbers are still predicted to increase in the next 25 years due to rapid population aging in China [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A considerable proportion of GC incidence might be preventable by healthy dietary habits in Korea [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>GC susceptibility genes in East Asian populations differ from those in other regions [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29-34</xref>]. To our knowledge, very few studies have focused on the epidemiological situation of GC in 5 East Asian countries. A study confirmed that ambient temperature has a significant impact on temperature-associated mortality, with cardiovascular mortality being especially vulnerable to both ambient temperature and diurnal temperature range [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, data within each iteration of GBD were comparable, but due to inherent limitations in the GBD methodology, results from different iterations, even for the same year, were not comparable. Differences in the GBD outcomes between iterations could be attributed to updates in data sources and improvements in methodology. Second, the accuracy of the estimated GC burden largely depends on the availability and quality of data acquired, which could be partially compensated by statistical methods. However, in regions with scarce data, especially in low-sociodemographic index countries, estimates could only rely on predictive covariates or global trends with consideration of sociodemographic index level and data from a single country, which is less representative. Extra caution should be taken when interpreting data from these areas. Additional high-quality population-based studies should be performed, especially in countries with scarce data. Third, some sources of uncertainty, including the covariates used in models, are not captured in our estimation process. The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to deviation in the prediction model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The disease burden of GC in 5 East Asian countries has been consistently substantial over the past 3 decades, particularly among older people. Considering the complexity of GC pathogenesis, the focus of current research should be on the etiological research and the development of therapeutic strategies. Public health strategies need to enhance early diagnosis and prevention of GC, as well as optimize the regional distribution of health care resources and implement effective environmental health policies. Research on the epidemiology of GC in the 5 East Asian countries population should be strengthened, particularly focusing on differentiated management and precise prevention and control strategies for various regions, genders, and age groups. Meanwhile, rehabilitation and long-term care for patients with GC require greater attention to improve patients&#8217; quality of life and reduce the burden on society and the health care system [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Complementary and alternative medicine combined with modern medicine plays an active role in the treatment of GC [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37-39</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SAP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2196/74389</object-id><label>Multimedia Appendix 1</label><caption><title>Prevalence, incidence, deaths, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life years of gastric cancer between 1990 and 2021 at the global and regional level and for 5 East Asian countries.</title></caption><media xlink:href="cancer-v11-e74389-s001.docx" xlink:title="DOCX File, 52 KB" id="d67e843" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SAP2" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2196/74389</object-id><label>Multimedia Appendix 2</label><caption><title>Age-specific prevalence, incidence, death, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life years numbers in 5 East Asian countries.</title></caption><media xlink:href="cancer-v11-e74389-s002.docx" xlink:title="DOCX File, 2478 KB" id="d67e850" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SAP3" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2196/74389</object-id><label>Multimedia Appendix 3</label><caption><title>Trends in the all-age prevalence, incidence, death, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life years number and rate by sex from 1990 to 2021.</title></caption><media xlink:href="cancer-v11-e74389-s003.docx" xlink:title="DOCX File, 4749 KB" id="d67e857" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SAP4" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2196/74389</object-id><label>Multimedia Appendix 4</label><caption><title>Average annual percent change of gastric cancer from 1990 to 2021 at the global and regional level and for 5 East Asian countries.</title></caption><media xlink:href="cancer-v11-e74389-s004.docx" xlink:title="DOCX File, 19 KB" id="d67e864" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SAP5" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2196/74389</object-id><label>Multimedia Appendix 5</label><caption><title>Age-period-cohort analysis of prevalence, incidence, and death rate.</title></caption><media xlink:href="cancer-v11-e74389-s005.docx" xlink:title="DOCX File, 1572 KB" id="d67e871" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SAP6" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2196/74389</object-id><label>Multimedia Appendix 6</label><caption><title>Autoregressive integrated moving average model and Bayesian age-period-cohort prediction in the 5 East Asian countries.</title></caption><media xlink:href="cancer-v11-e74389-s006.docx" xlink:title="DOCX File, 476 KB" id="d67e878" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We acknowledge the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (University of Washington), the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Collaborators, and all staff who provided the data necessary for this study.
