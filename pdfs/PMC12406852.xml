While often framed as cost-saving measures, this paper argues that self-care should be understood as a strategic investment in health system performance. Drawing on costing and financing analyses and previous literature, we explore how self-care interventions can enhance efficiency, resilience and equity of health systems. We propose a costing framework that outlines cost components across development, implementation and scale-up, emphasising both system and individual-level considerations. We argue that sustainable scale-up of self-care requires diversified financing models, including tax-based funding, insurance mechanisms and reduced out-of-pocket costs for users. Successful integration also demands governance structures that prioritise quality, equity and continuity of care. By reframing self-care as a health system investment rather than a cost-containment tool, policymakers can better harness its potential to improve access, reduce burden on facilities and empower individuals in managing their health. Self-care interventions for SRH, when embedded within broader health system strengthening efforts, have the potential to be transformative for SRH outcomes and for progressing towards universal health coverage.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Health systems</kwd><kwd>Universal Health Care</kwd><kwd>Health services research</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Population Services International</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO#13967</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Summary box</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" list-content="ul"><list-item><p>Self-care interventions are increasingly recognised to improve access to essential sexual and reproductive health services, in particular in low- and middle-income countries.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We argue that investments in self-care interventions should be seen as a strategic health systems investment rather than a cost-containment strategy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our analysis can provide policy makers with a better understanding of how scaling up self-care interventions for sexual and reproductive health can be considered as part of broader investments in health system strengthening.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p> Self-care interventions for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) have emerged as a promising approach to expanding healthcare access, increasing efficiency and strengthening individual autonomy. The concept of self-care is rooted in the idea that individuals, families and communities can take responsibility for their own health through preventive, diagnostic and treatment-related actions&#8212;either independently or with support from healthcare providers. The WHO has recognised self-care as a strategy for improving health system resilience and achieving universal health coverage (UHC), especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where health systems often face significant resource constraints.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><p>The growing body of evidence suggests that self-care interventions for SRH, such as HIV self-testing, self-managed abortion and self-injected contraception, hold immense potential for improving SRH outcomes while reducing the strain on healthcare facilities.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, despite its promise at a systemic level, self-care is often framed as a cost-saving mechanism rather than a strategic investment in health systems.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5 6</sup></xref></p><p>In this analysis, we use insights from our work on costing and financing of self-care for SRH,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and the conceptual framework on self-care developed to inform WHO guidelines,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> to discuss costing and financing of self-care interventions for SRH and its implications for the broader health system. Based on this discussion, we argue that self-care should be understood not only as a means of reducing healthcare costs but as an investment that has the potential to enhance health system performance by improving efficiency and, ultimately, population health.</p><p>Self-care financing considerations are especially pressing in the current global health context, where official development assistance budgets are declining across many Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and the U.S Agency for International Development (USAID), the world&#8217;s largest global health donor, faces significant restructuring or potential dismantling.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> This contraction in external financing for global health heightens the urgency of identifying sustainable, domestically financed strategies to maintain and expand access to essential health services. In this environment, self-care interventions for SRH stand out not only for their potential to improve individual autonomy and health system efficiency, but also for contributing to health systems being less dependent on unpredictable donor funding.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Self-care for sexual and reproductive health as a strategic health system investment</title><p>Historically, healthcare models have been structured around facility-based, provider-led care. This has required individuals to navigate complex health systems to access essential services. Self-care presents a shift in this paradigm by enabling individuals to manage aspects of their health independently, often outside formal healthcare settings. However, most self-care initiatives in LMICs have not been integrated into the country&#8217;s health system, limiting their potential to contribute to strengthening health system goals. The conceptual framework used to inform the WHO guidelines on self-care describes two complementary perspectives: a people-centred approach, which emphasises individual empowerment and a system-centred approach, which focuses on health system efficiencies.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> A system-centred perspective is particularly relevant for health policymakers and those financing self-care, as it highlights the ways in which self-care can contribute to broader health system goals.</p><p>One of the most significant advantages of self-care is its ability to expand access to SRH services, particularly in settings where healthcare infrastructure is weak or overburdened.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 5</sup></xref> For example, in rural and underserved areas where access to healthcare providers is limited, self-care interventions such as HIV self-testing kits and self-injected contraceptives provide individuals with the means to manage their health autonomously. By reducing the reliance on clinic-based services, these interventions not only improve access to and empowerment of marginalised individuals, but also contribute to health system resilience.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Reducing clinic-based services can also free up resources, which is particularly important in LMICs where shortages of trained healthcare workers often limit service delivery.</p><p>Moreover, self-care is associated with significant cost savings for both individuals and health systems. From the perspective of the individual, self-care eliminates several direct and indirect costs associated with facility-based care, such as transportation expenses, consultation fees and lost wages due to time spent seeking services. For example, self-injected contraceptives, which allow users to self-administer subcutaneous depo medroxyprogesterone acetate, have been tested in several countries in Africa, including Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Senegal and Burkina Faso, with promising results.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> A study from 2018 showed that it lowers non-medical costs for the client.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> The WHO recommendations on self-care interventions, as well as the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Health Service in the UK, recommend that self-injected contraceptives be made available as an additional delivery approach for contraception.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12 13</sup></xref> From a health system perspective, self-care reduces the burden on facility-based services, allowing for better allocation of limited resources. Examples from HIV self-testing in Malawi have shown that integrating self-care into national HIV strategies reduces unit costs per test and increases the cost-effectiveness of case detection.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> A recent study in Kenya illustrated the cost-effectiveness of HIV self-testing among truck drivers.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> These economic efficiencies demonstrate why self-care should not merely be seen as a cost-cutting exercise but as an investment for improving health system performance.</p><p>Self-care interventions should complement existing health services rather than replace them. Introducing self-care therefore requires investments in the broader health system.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> For instance, the introduction of self-care services like HIV self-testing has been integrated into many African countries&#8217; healthcare strategies, contributing significantly to expanded access to testing. However, the integration of self-care interventions must also consider the impact on other resources in the health system, including clinic infrastructure, digital reporting systems, the workload of healthcare workers and the availability of medical supplies such as test kits and medication. In two Southern African countries (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="boxed-text">box 1</xref>), healthcare workers spend a significant portion of their time on activities related to HIV self-testing, which can affect resource allocation but also offers potential efficiency gains.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Moreover, self-care interventions require careful governance and leadership to be effectively implemented. National and local governments should collaborate with key health system actors to design and implement self-care policies. Successful examples, such as the development of domestic HIV self-testing guidelines in Southern Africa,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> demonstrate the importance of strong governance and community involvement in supporting self-care programmes.</p><boxed-text id="B1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Box 1</label><caption><title>Health systems implications and challenges for HIV self-testing in Malawi and South Africa</title></caption><p>This case report highlights the evolving role of HIV self-testing (HIVST) in Malawi and South Africa as both countries work towards the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets. HIVST is increasingly recognised as a critical tool to expand access to testing, particularly among hard-to-reach populations and is supported by national policies aligned with WHO guidelines.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20 21</sup></xref></p><p>In Malawi, HIVST is largely donor-funded, with more than 95% of HIV/AIDS expenditure sourced externally.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> While the Ministry of Health has embraced implementation responsibilities, the financial burden remains with international partners like USAID and The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Although policy frameworks support domestic investment, limited public financial management capacity hinders internal funding. Strengthening domestic financing mechanisms and exploring public-private partnerships are key next steps, especially given the expanding role of the private sector in health service delivery.</p><p>In South Africa, the government has begun directly investing in HIVST, including procurement of self-test kits. However, public sector contributions remain modest compared with the scale needed. The private sector has significantly contributed through local manufacturing, reducing costs and enhancing accessibility. South Africa exemplifies a mixed-model approach, combining government, donor and private sector roles. There is strong evidence for the cost-effectiveness of HIVST.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23 24</sup></xref> Efforts are also underway to lower test prices below USD 1.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Innovations such as digital health tools also offer future potential for cost-effective scale-up, although adoption is still limited.</p><p>Key health system challenges include sustaining HIVST financing post-donor funding, managing cost-shifting to users, ensuring strong supply chains and integrating HIVST with broader health services. Both countries must strengthen budgetary systems and promote private sector engagement to ensure sustainable and equitable access to HIVST, particularly as a gateway to early diagnosis and treatment under the 95-95-95 framework.</p></boxed-text><sec id="s2-1"><title>Costs and financing for investing in self-care</title><p>Cost and financing considerations for self-care interventions are important and should be fully captured and understood within a context of the broader self-care ecosystem. Ultimately, a robust understanding of the costs and financing of self-care should aim to support decision-makers to understand their cost-effectiveness and value for money within the health system and how these interventions can be scaled up and financed in ways that support progress towards UHC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Understanding the costs of investing in self-care</title><p>To fully understand the financial implications of investing in self-care, it is essential to examine the various cost components associated with its implementation. We outline these costs for three stages: development, implementation and scale-up (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). At each of these stages, it is necessary to consider both the cost to the individual and cost to the health system.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Costing framework for self-care interventions (authors framework based on<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3 4 26 27</sup></xref>).</title></caption><graphic position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="bmjgh-10-Suppl_6-g001.jpg"/></fig><p>The development stage involves the costs of policy formulation, regulatory approval and pilot testing of self-care interventions in SRH. These initial investments are critical for ensuring that self-care products and services meet quality standards and are integrated into national health policies. For example, regulatory approval processes for self-care interventions such as HIV self-testing, self-injected contraception and other reproductive health services require rigorous evaluations and supply chain considerations to ensure safety and effectiveness. While these upfront costs may be substantial, they are necessary to establish the foundation for sustainable self-care delivery.</p><p>The implementation stage includes expenditures on service delivery mechanisms, training of healthcare providers, procurement of self-care commodities and community engagement efforts to promote uptake and demand. Many self-care interventions in SRH require public awareness campaigns to ensure individuals can use these products safely and effectively. This is especially important for interventions that involve self-sampling or self-administration, where correct use is essential for reliable results. Implementation costs can vary depending on the distribution model, with community-based approaches often proving more cost-effective than facility-based services.</p><p>The scale-up stage involves investments in supply chain infrastructure, digital health integration and long-term sustainability planning. One of the key challenges of scaling self-care interventions is ensuring a consistent supply of high-quality products, particularly in LMICs where supply chain disruptions can hinder access. To address this, governments must invest in robust procurement and distribution systems that enable widespread access to self-care products. Over time, economies of scale can reduce per-unit costs, making self-care interventions more cost-effective in the long run.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cost for individuals</title><p>Understanding the cost for individuals requires consideration of costs for obtaining care and information seeking, productivity loss and time. Self-care may reduce some of the patient costs associated with facility-based care, including user fees, transport costs, information-seeking and productivity losses.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> An advantage of self-care is that it enables choice and provides opportunities for individuals and communities to manage their health on their own terms. This is particularly valuable in the context of time saved and productivity gained, where individuals adapt health behaviours according to the associated costs. However, in some cases, self-care can increase the direct cost for the client. For example, self-care interventions that are typically provided at a healthcare facility need to be purchased elsewhere, the direct cost of care will shift onto the individual. However, this may still provide value to the individual in terms of convenience and accessibility. In addition to the economic advantages, self-care can have additional benefits for individuals. Self-care can protect individuals from the social cost of the stigma associated with seeking facility-based care for SRH needs that are socially controversial, for example, abortion and HIV/AIDS care and family planning counselling.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cost to the health system</title><p>At the health system level, costs include direct and indirect medical and non-medical costs. Self-care may reduce costs to the health system by offering individuals an alternative approach to facility-based care, freeing up resources within the healthcare system and improving efficiencies. Self-care is known to reduce the direct costs of care associated with rendering healthcare services, including staff salaries and commodity costs.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Cost savings within health systems primarily occur downstream, by improving linkages to care and promoting self-management, reducing the need for patient hospitalisation down the line.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4 18</sup></xref> Self-care for SRH can contribute to reduced cost for the health system if it improves clients&#8217; access and adherence to treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> However, previous work has shown that healthcare providers are concerned about increased rates of complications resulting from misuse of healthcare products and limited health literacy,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> which could potentially drive the costs for the health system. The return on investment for self-care is thus promising. However, it requires creating an enabling health systems environment where sustained demand for self-care is continually generated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Understanding financing of self-care: exploring funding sources</title><p>Long-term and sustainable financing of SRH self-care interventions in LMICs requires a multipronged approach that combines multiple funding sources. Public financing is primarily generated through general tax revenue such as value added tax or income tax. Several countries, such as Ghana, Rwanda, Zambia, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa, already have or are in the process of establishing National Health Insurance schemes funded through public sources, which could also serve as financing mechanisms for self-care interventions. Other countries, including Malawi, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Tanzania, primarily provide free services at public health facilities financed through government budgets, which, if extended to self-care, may require new financing arrangements. Private financing includes revenue generated through private health insurance or through out-of-pocket expenditure from healthcare users. External funding and foreign aid from donors and organisations help promote economic development and implementation of self-care in LMICs. However, external funding for health in LMIC is increasingly limited and highly contested and is unlikely to be a sustainable source of financing for self-care in the medium to long term. This is now more apparent due to the uncertainty around funding from USAID and the President&#8217;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which have, collectively, invested billions of dollars into health programmes in Africa.</p><p>A number of principles exist that would contribute to the sustainability of SRH self-care interventions in LMICs. These include moving towards domestic sources for health spending, involving private and informal sectors to provide self-care and finally, exploring differentiated financing models to finance self-care. In many LMICs, self-care interventions are currently funded from external sources of financing. However, increasing domestic spending on health more generally and self-care specifically, would improve sustainability.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Moreover, there is the potential to expand self-care through improved partnerships with the private and informal sectors which may provide opportunities for improved access to services. Finally, there may be scope for blended financing models that include a mix of tax-based funding, private financing, insurance and partial out-of-pocket expenditure.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Regardless of model, financing self-care should focus on reducing costs for the user to prevent excessive out-of-pocket expenditure.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p>Financing SRH self-care should prioritise accessibility, quality, equity and affordability. Self-care can enhance healthcare access, particularly for those facing barriers, while also improving choice and self-management. However, the choice of financing methods has an impact on equity. Promoting self-care as a cost-saving measure by shifting cost to users and relying on people paying out of pocket is undesirable as it may disadvantage low-income population groups. If users have to obtain test kits or other supplies to access an intervention, which would otherwise be paid for by the health system, these costs should be retained by the health system and not transferred to the user.</p><p>While self-care interventions hold significant promise for improving access, efficiency and individual autonomy in managing health, they also present notable challenges. Many LMICs lack robust health information systems, complicating the monitoring of utilisation, quality and outcomes of self-care, which are essential for accountability and effective resource allocation. Concerns also arise around the correct and safe use of self-care products, as limited health literacy or inadequate counselling can lead to misuse or missed opportunities for linkage to further care. Moreover, poorly regulated private markets may prioritise commercial interests over quality, resulting in fragmented care and widening disparities. Addressing these downsides requires thoughtful integration of self-care into health systems, coupled with strong governance, financing protections and regulatory oversight to ensure equitable, safe and effective implementation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Self-care interventions for SRH represent more than just an alternative to facility-based services and cost savings in resource constrained systems; it is a strategic investment that, well executed, can contribute to stronger health systems, enhanced efficiency and improved health outcomes. Self-care can add value by enabling choice and giving people autonomy over their health, linking them to care when needed and supporting those who experience barriers to obtaining care. In this article, we have described costing and financing aspects of investment in self-care for SRH. Understanding the costs and conceptualising suitable ways of financing self-care is critical for moving self-care forward, contributing to sustainable, acceptable and affordable care for individuals and communities. Cost and financing considerations for specific self-care interventions are important. However, how these interventions create value for money and impact the entire health system must also be fully captured to support decision makers&#8217; understanding of health systems implications of investment in self-care. Self-care for SRH holds great potential, but must be scaled up and financed in ways that support progress towards UHC.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This analysis is based on work commissioned by the Population Services International and the Self-care trailblazer group.
