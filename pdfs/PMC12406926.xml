Unlike many adult malignancies, primary prevention of childhood cancers is not possible. Improving survival requires a two-pronged strategy: earlier diagnosis and effective treatment. Our study aims to establish the feasibility, clinical and implementation effectiveness of an adapted early warning signs and symptoms (EWSS) intervention in Cameroon and Kenya. It will equip healthcare workers, Ministry of Health (MOH) representatives and National Cancer Institute leaders with evidence-informed guidance on implementing context-adapted interventions to improve the early detection and referral of childhood cancers in these countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study is a quasi-experimental, hybrid type 2 implementation effectiveness study based on a Ghanaian adaptation of the &#8216;Saint Siluan&#8217; EWSS campaign. Our protocol proposes context-specific adaptation and evidence-based implementation of the EWSS intervention through iterative engagement with country-level implementation teams to train healthcare workers and improve referral pathways for earlier childhood cancer diagnoses in each study country. Training effectiveness will be measured through pretraining and post-training tests of knowledge and application, as well as training satisfaction surveys. Clinical effectiveness will be assessed by using a REDCap database to track the number of newly diagnosed childhood cancer cases in the study regions and counties, healthcare timelines and paths to diagnosis, and the stage and proportion of metastatic disease at diagnosis. Implementation effectiveness will be evaluated through interviews with senior and mid-level health system partners and clinicians, tracking fidelity to the implementation process as laid out in The Implementation Roadmap Workbook, and analysis of meeting minutes from monthly local implementation team meetings.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has received ethical approval from The Hospital for Sick Children (REB # 1000080092) and all participating sites.

Globally, &gt;400&#8201;000 children are diagnosed with cancer every year, with 80% living in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Cure rates in high-income countries (HICs) generally exceed 80%, but LMIC cure rates are significantly lower, sitting at &lt;20% in many sub-Saharan African countries.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Africa alone is expected to account for over half the global childhood cancer burden by 2035.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The WHO launched the Global Initiative on Childhood Cancer (GICC) in 2018 to increase global cure rates. Since primary prevention of childhood cancer is generally not possible, approaches to improving survival require a two-pronged strategy: secondary prevention and access to effective treatment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Interventions to improve early diagnosis and referral of childhood cancers are effective if properly designed and implemented: they have been linked to increased case detection, earlier stage at diagnosis and improved overall survival. Childhood cancer treatment programmes are now established in numerous LMIC settings. Still, effective treatment is dependent on children presenting at earlier disease stages, as cure rates for advanced cancer are low.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>Delayed diagnosis is a critical impediment to the effective care of children with cancer in LMICs. Several contributing factors have been identified: (1) lack of awareness that cancer can occur in children; (2) lack of knowledge of signs and symptoms that may indicate an underlying cancer; and (3) lack of clear referral pathways for children in whom cancer is suspected.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 4 5</sup></xref> Several LMIC interventions to mitigate delays in diagnosis have shown effectiveness in increasing knowledge and key clinical outcomes, resulting in decreased proportions of patients with advanced disease.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Our systematic review demonstrated that most LMIC interventions that facilitated the recognition of early warning signs and symptoms (EWSS) for childhood cancers have focused on educating healthcare workers (HCWs), including nurses, physicians and primary care providers.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Of the 10 studies identified, intervention duration, scope and modality varied considerably, with all identified studies reporting at least one improved outcome: increased referral rates, shorter diagnostic lag time, increased knowledge or improved survival. HCW-focused interventions hold significant potential to improve LMIC childhood cancer outcomes. However, our review also underscored the need to adapt interventions for specific country contexts based on best practices in implementation science.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Childhood cancer in Kenya and Cameroon</title><p>Cameroon has a population of 27.7&#8201;million, while Kenya has a population of 53.5&#8201;million. Both populations are ethnically diverse and young, with children 0&#8211;14 years making up 42% and 38% of the population, respectively.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The incidence of childhood cancer is not precisely known due to the lack of comprehensive country-wide cancer registries, underdiagnosis and under-registration. However, WHO estimates suggest incidence rates of 55 and 53 cases per million people in Cameroon and Kenya.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Additional modelling estimated 4135 and 4821 incident childhood cancer cases in Cameroon and Kenya, respectively, in 2015, of which 60% were undiagnosed.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Thus, 5374 patients may benefit from this intervention. Despite progress in improving health indicators, healthcare access remains inadequate for many in Kenya and Cameroon, particularly in rural areas. The lack of universal health coverage has led to inequitable access for low-income families, resulting in high rates of delayed diagnosis and mortality for childhood cancers.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Kenyan and Cameroonian health systems</title><p>The decentralised health system in Cameroon is divided into three levels: central, intermediate and peripheral<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). The Ministry of Public Health represents the administrative structure at the central level. It is responsible for enacting and empowering policy and strategy while coordinating regulations and activities, allocating resources, defining new programmes, ensuring the training of human resources and supervising the intermediate level. The administrative structure for the intermediate level comprises 10 regional public health delegations representing and coordinating health activities in their specific regions while providing technical support to their districts, translating policies, laws and programmes into activities for which resources may be allocated and supervising the peripheral level. The administrative structure for the peripheral level comprises the district health services, which are the operational teams that lead the implementation of health programmes and mobilise the community towards an anticipated action.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Structure of Cameroon&#8217;s healthcare system.

The first five are managed at the county level, and the national government manages the sixth. The first level comprises community facilities operated by certified medical clinical officers who provide preventative healthcare, essential sanitation services and health education. The second level is dispensaries, the first point of patient contact, run by clinical officers for essential outpatient services for common illnesses. The third level is health centres and smaller hospitals with limited facilities operated by physicians, clinical officers and nurses. The fourth level is county hospitals that offer holistic services operated by physicians and interdisciplinary HCWs. The fifth level is county referral hospitals that provide specialised care and conduct healthcare research, staffed by multiple medical professionals and public health staff. The sixth level is teaching and referral hospitals that provide complex healthcare with highly skilled personnel and support the training of healthcare workers. They are responsible for curative, tertiary and preventative care, research, and academic training and serve as a major nidus for childhood cancer care in the country. Parallel privatised healthcare is also available in Kenya, which is a prominent separate sector of the health system, commanding 50% of services, technology and products.

In addition, Cameroon and Kenya represent different geographic, linguistic and health system realities, broadening the potential for generalisability and external validity of the adapted EWSS intervention.</p><p>In each country, districts or counties were selected by local leaders within the established catchment areas of participating childhood cancer treatment units in referral hospitals (Kenya: Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH); Cameroon: Chantal Biya Foundation Mother and Child Centre, Mbingo Baptist Hospital) for study inclusion.</p><p>In Kenya, KNH was selected as the primary study site. The study will also be implemented across several counties, including Nyeri, Garissa, Embu, Meru, Machakos, Murang&#8217;a and Nairobi. In Cameroon, activities will be conducted at the Chantal Biya Foundation Mother and Child Centre and Mbingo Baptist Hospital. Two regions will be involved: the Centre and West regions. The Centre region&#8217;s participating districts include Odza, Bafia, Obala, Biyem-Assi, Cit&#233; Verte and Efoulan.

TIR integrates several implementation science frameworks in stepwise guidance to be used by local operational implementation teams in each project setting, with facilitation as needed from the project&#8217;s lead implementation scientist (MB) and in-country team leads (AP, GM, FL, JG). The Active Implementation Framework (AIF)<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> informs the overarching implementation process. Within the process, TIR guides implementers in identifying their needs, feasibility and capacity for delivering the intervention&#8217;s core components and implementation determinants (barriers and facilitators) based on the CFIR.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Strategies to address determinants are based on the Expert Recommendations for Implementation Change compilation.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Implementation outcomes are informed by the Implementation Outcomes Taxonomy.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Considerations for equitable implementation are integrated into TIR using several sources. Following established process guidance, TIR engages each country to develop leadership implementation teams (LITs) and operational implementation teams (OITs). OITs work with the support of the implementation facilitators to work through activities within four implementation stages: exploration, preparation, initial implementation and measure and sustain. A project launch meeting will occur in each country to familiarise partners with one another and project goals, identify regions/counties and the appropriate target levels for healthcare provider training, and recruit suitably positioned individuals to participate in country OITs and LITs. Each country will identify an implementation facilitator to work with the country research leads and support implementation planning, execution and data collection. Implementation facilitators will meet with country OITs virtually to work through implementation planning and execution using TIR.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Guiding the implementation of the EWSS intervention with TIR</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TIR phase</th><th valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exploration</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Scores will be analysed for change significance. Indicators of frequency, duration and training coverage will be prospectively tracked. Adherence to and perceived quality of EWSS training content will be assessed through surveys of participating HCWs. OITs will use a monitoring and evaluation checklist to evaluate the fidelity and conduct of each training session.</p><p>Clinical: Clinical variables will include the number of newly diagnosed childhood cancer cases in study regions and non-participating regions, healthcare time and path to diagnosis, and the stage and proportion of metastatic disease at diagnosis through augmentation of existing systems for clinical data collection at participating referral hospitals, captured in a consolidated REDCap study database. Clinical covariates will include sex, age bracket (0&#8211;4, 5&#8211;9, 10&#8211;14), socioeconomic status, region of residence and malignancy type. The Toronto Staging Guidelines, consensus-based guidelines for staging childhood cancers, will inform the staging assessment of diagnosed malignancies.</p><p>Implementation: We will track TIR tasks and milestones on SmartSheet project management software and OIT meeting minutes to assess implementation fidelity and effectiveness. We will also conduct qualitative semistructured interviews based on the CFIR and developed with local health system partner input to assess the implementation process and salient determinant factors. CFIR identifies 47 determinant factors across five domains representing barriers and facilitators associated with implementation effectiveness: intervention characteristics, process, inner setting, outer setting and characteristics of individuals engaging with the intervention and its implementation.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Respondents will be identified using a stratified purposive sample of key informants involved in the OITs. Sample size will be determined deductively through constant comparative methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Training: We anticipate the potential for sex-related and gender-related differences in the impact of HCW training on expert and lay knowledge about childhood cancers, diagnostic/referral patterns and decisions about implementation. It is possible that sociocultural dynamics attached to gender identities and roles will influence differential uptake and impact of early detection practices along gender lines, including through preferential care-seeking by families based on the sex and gender of the affected child and health worker biases related to gender. Anticipating the influence of these factors on the uptake of the EWSS intervention remains challenging. To account for the potential impact of sex and gender in the conduct and results of our study, we will maintain an explicit focus on sex-based and gender-based determinants in the thematic analysis of implementation effectiveness. In addition, ongoing, iterative engagement with the OITs and LITs, alongside culturally sensitive adaptations to the intervention, is expected to help mitigate any identified inequities.</p><p>Clinical effectiveness: Using Poisson distributions, the primary analysis will compare newly diagnosed childhood cancer cases between post-intervention and pre-intervention periods. From retrospective data compiled by our study team, the retrospective number of newly diagnosed childhood cancer over 2 years in our target districts was 313 cases. Assuming a Poisson distribution, we will have 80% power to detect a true increase in the number of cases to 384 in the 2 years post-intervention (rate ratio of 1.2) associated with the EWSS intervention. Secondary analyses will compare healthcare time to diagnosis using generalised estimating equations to account for district/county and country clustering. We will also use logistical regression models to compare the proportions of children presenting with metastatic disease. Finally, exploratory analyses will be conducted for specific malignancies.</p><p>Implementation effectiveness: We will thematically analyse interview data, drawing on the CFIR to guide deductive data coding and interpretation of salient implementation determinants. Coding and analysis employing relevant CFIR domains will identify factors associated with implementation success or failure. Interviews will follow the rapid analysis method, which provides valid findings in a short timeframe and minimises the need for transcription. We will organise findings by relevant CFIR domains to furnish rich insights into the nature and determinants of successful EWSS interventions in Cameroon and Kenya.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>None.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ethics</title><p>This study has received ethical approval from The Hospital for Sick Children (REB #1000080092) and from all participating sites in the two study countries. In Cameroon, we obtained National Ethical Clearance from the Cameroon Ethical Board (Ref #1699) and Regional Administrative Authorizations for our pilot sites in the Centre and West regions. In Kenya, we received ethical approval from the KNH Ethics and Research Committee (Ref #KNH-ERC/RR/955) and secured a National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation in Kenya licence for the pilot counties. Furthermore, as clinical data will be collected from existing health registries and patient charts, patient consent will not be required. However, consent will be obtained from all members of the LITs and OITs for any data they share during participation in the implementation meetings. Consent will also be obtained from all individuals participating in the semistructured interviews.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dissemination goals</title><p>Our dissemination goals are to build awareness, share knowledge, reinforce EWSS sustainment in project districts, and prepare decision-makers for EWSS scale-up in other Cameroonian and Kenyan districts and other sub-Saharan African jurisdictions. We also hope to stimulate further policy-relevant research on the early detection of childhood cancers in a range of LMIC health systems. The research can also inform salient implementation determinants for similar interventions in sub-Saharan Africa, supporting future planning and execution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Target audiences and dissemination strategies</title><p>The project uses both integrated and end-of-grant dissemination strategies. Integrated knowledge translation occurs continuously within the OITs and LITs. For end-of-grant dissemination, we will employ several complementary strategies to build awareness and share findings among various target audiences: (1) key county and regional parties (eg, clinical societies, advocacy groups, country MOHs, and regional bodies such as the East African Community, Economic Community of West African States); (2) international bodies such as the WHO (strategies: meetings, plain language summaries, infographics, web posts, social media blasts, media releases); and (3) the academic community (strategies: presentations, peer-reviewed publications). We anticipate at least two end-of-grant in-person meetings with key partners, one in Kenya and one in Cameroon.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Facilitators of knowledge translation success</title><p>A key facilitator is the inclusion of many of the identified knowledge translation target audiences and organisations on our study team. Examples include MOH and National Cancer Institutes in Kenya (Nyangasi, Karagu) and Cameroon (Ndom), the EAC Secretariat (Sonoiya), and multiple international collaborators: the African Organisation for Research and Training in Cancer (AORTIC), World Child Cancer (Mbah, Freccero), International Society of Pediatric Oncology (Githang&#8217;a, Macharia, Denburg, Gupta), Non-Communicable Disease Child Secretariat (Bhutta) and the WHO GICC (Denburg, Gupta). Letters from many of the above organisations testify to their support. This is a critical strength of the project and ensures that emerging study findings will be communicated to target audiences throughout the study period.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The primary goal of our study is to implement and sustain an adapted EWSS intervention in target districts and demonstrate its clinical and implementation effectiveness in these health system settings. The follow-up goal is to ensure sustainability and promote scale-up across Cameroon and Kenya districts/regions by the respective national health systems. The tertiary goal is to disseminate the intervention and project findings to other sub-Saharan African countries where it can be adapted for broader implementation. Finally, we hope to stimulate further policy-relevant research on the early detection of childhood cancers in LMIC health systems.</p><p>We expect this study&#8217;s results will lead to earlier detection, more appropriate and streamlined referrals and timelier diagnoses of childhood cancers in Kenya and Cameroon. In addition, we hope to build competencies in evidence-based implementation that can translate to other interventions. If we are successful, our evidence may incentivise policymakers in Cameroon and Kenya to spread the EWSS intervention to other jurisdictions in the study countries. Building research and implementation capacity is critical to improving health outcomes, and we hope our efforts will provide a foundation to build. We also hope to equip domestic and regional policymakers in West and East Africa with the knowledge to support effective evidence-based implementation within and across countries in these regions, thus improving outcomes for large populations of children with cancer.</p><p>The fight to reduce the mortality of childhood cancer, specifically in LMICs, requires an interdisciplinary and holistic approach to care premised on understanding and adapting to the local health system and sociopolitical realities and the application of implementation science. We hope to demonstrate an effective approach to implementing a context-adapted EWSS programme for healthcare practitioners that can translate into sustainable health system practices that improve outcomes for children with cancer in Kenya and Cameroon and provide evidence-informed models for the implementation of comparable early diagnosis programmes in a range of LMICs.</p><p>One of the key strengths of this study is its grounding in the perspectives and expertise of clinicians and local health system partners, combined with an evidence-based implementation science approach. This foundation allows for the co-development and integration of a contextually adapted intervention within existing health system structures. The study enables simultaneous evaluation of outcomes and implementation processes by employing a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design. Findings will be reported in alignment with established guidelines such as the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies (StaRI), promoting methodological rigour, transparency, reproducibility and broader applicability. In addition, conducting this study across two countries with distinct health systems and decentralised governance structures (ie, multiple independent counties or regions) offers a valuable opportunity to generate cross-contextual insights to inform future scale-up and adaptation.</p><p>However, there are several limitations to consider. Due to funding constraints, the training intervention is limited to formal healthcare workers, excluding community health providers and traditional healers who also play essential roles in early cancer recognition and referral. The study does not explicitly address the engagement of these community-based actors, which may affect the comprehensiveness and reach of the intervention, though OIT representatives will be in regular contact with community health and extension workers throughout the rollout of the intervention, provided opportunities for community-level engagement and dissemination. The selection of participating regions and counties was intentional, influenced by initial interest and motivation of local leaders and health system partners, including input from MOHs and local partners. Higher readiness improves implementation outcomes; when sites are more motivated and interested, they are more likely to engage in capacity-building and problem-solving efforts needed for complex implementations.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Motivated sites tend to implement interventions with greater fidelity while engaging in more thoughtful adaptations to their context.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Improved engagement and sustainability of local partners drive local ownership, which increases the chance of long-term sustainability.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> However, we note that this selection approach may not reflect implementation in lower-readiness or less-motivated settings and that exclusively working with high-readiness settings can unintentionally worsen disparities by leaving behind under-resourced or lower-capacity organisations. We mitigated this by intentionally selecting at least one lower-resourced region in each country.</p><p>The study is in the pre-implementation phase, with plans to transition to the implementation phase in July 2025 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). The anticipated end date (including execution of knowledge dissemination plans) for the study is September 2028. Sustainability planning is built into our implementation process, ensuring that both countries will explore opportunities to secure funding from local organisations, which could support other initiatives with long-term, downstream benefits. The study team has integrated long-term evaluation measures into the programme to have each country&#8217;s government lead its continued implementation and sustainment through the final phase of TIR to scale or expand future efforts.</p><fig position="float" id="F3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Study implementation timeline.
