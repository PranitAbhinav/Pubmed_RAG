Despite achieving vaccination targets, Thailand faced disparities in vaccine coverage across regions. This study aims to explore spatial clustering patterns and examine socioeconomic, demographic, and health service-related determinants of COVID-19 vaccine coverage across Thailand. The findings are intended to inform strategies for equitable vaccine distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p id="Par2">A cross-sectional ecological study was conducted using secondary data from all 76 provinces in Thailand. Spatial analysis techniques were employed to assess spatial autocorrelation using Moran&#8217;s I and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). Additionally, spatial regression models were developed to explain vaccine coverage. Three models were tested and compared: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Spatial Lag Model (SLM), and Spatial Error Model (SEM). Model performance was evaluated based on R&#178;, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), log-likelihood, and residual diagnostics.</p></sec><sec><title>Result</title><p id="Par3">Moran&#8217;s I and LISA indicated significant positive spatial autocorrelation in vaccine coverage for both 2021 (0.427) and 2022 (0.467), with high-high clusters primarily concentrated in the Eastern region. The Spatial Error Model demonstrated the best performance and was most suitable for explaining the spatial variation in COVID-19 vaccine coverage. In 2021, vaccine coverage was associated with population density, nighttime light (NTL), public transport, income, health workers, COVID-19 cases and deaths (R&#178; = 0.699). In 2022, key factors were the elderly population, nighttime light, internet access, and health workers (R&#178; = 0.610).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">We conclude that in 2021, COVID-19 vaccine availability saw limited vaccine quantities distributed unevenly. Areas with substantial economic growth, high COVID-19 incidence rates, and a significant presence of health workers tended to have higher COVID-19 vaccine coverage. In 2022, vaccine availability improved with extensive distribution and community-level services targeting vulnerable groups, supported by online decision-making tools and a reservation system.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Vaccine coverage</kwd><kwd>Spatial autocorrelation</kwd><kwd>Spatial regression</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">The novel coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) is a new strain of virus that was first discovered in 2019. It is viruses that cause respiratory disease and could spread from infected person to person. In 2023, the pandemic had 700&#160;million cases and 7&#160;million deaths globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Thailand reported 4,711,528 confirmed cases and 33,669 deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Beyond its health impacts, COVID-19 has significantly affected economic and social systems. Therefore, the government has cooperated with all sectors to find solutions to the problem.</p><p id="Par6">The COVID-19 vaccine was another important key to driving Thailand out of the COVID-19 crisis. Comprehensive and rapid vaccine deployment was essential to enhance individual immunity, reduce infection rates, prevent severe illness, decrease mortality, and establish community herd immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Consequently, the government designated COVID-19 vaccination as a priority policy to be implemented alongside existing public health measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. According to the report, in 2022, a total of 116,680,622 vaccine doses were administered, and 44,617,389 individuals completing full vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">COVID-19 vaccine service coverage across provinces depends on demographic, socioeconomic, and health service factors. Literature reviews indicate that demographic characteristics factors, particularly population density and people living in municipalities, were associated with COVID-19 outbreaks. The government prioritizes the target groups for COVID-19 vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which include the elderly, people with chronic diseases, and pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, health workers represented the highest-risk group for exposure and transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Socioeconomic factors in each area were influenced by local environmental and infrastructural conditions. Areas with high economic growth will have facilities and support for life in every aspect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], including public transportation and communication systems, which might all be factors that facilitate access to the health service system and vaccination services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, such areas often function as centers of economic and social activity, such as education, industry, business, and other establishments. These characteristics make them suitable locations for establishing vaccination centers and providing services efficiently to the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Health service-related factors reflect the contextual and capacity for COVID-19 vaccine services in each area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], such as health workers staffing rate and number of health service locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates reflected the severity of local outbreaks, which in turn heightened public awareness and increased the perceived importance of receiving vaccination services in each area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In the overview of vaccinations in Thailand, this was despite the fact that the vaccination has reached the target set by the government. But there was still a problem with coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine. Many areas were low and should be provided with equality. In past studies, although there have been many studies on COVID-19 vaccines, geographic information systems (GIS) have not been used to study issues regarding COVID-19 vaccines in Thailand. By applying analytical methods in the form of spatial statistics, from creating a map, divided into color groups according to rank decile to show the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine coverage and test the spatial relationships. Recent studies have demonstrated nighttime light (NTL) applications in public health, including measles vaccination campaign monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and COVID-19 incidence analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, no studies have applied NTL analysis specifically to vaccine coverage patterns. This study makes several novel contributions to spatial epidemiology and health policy research. First, it is the first to apply nighttime light satellite imagery as a proxy for vaccine accessibility and equity assessment, extending NTL applications from disease surveillance to vaccination equity analysis. Second, this represents the first comprehensive spatial analysis of COVID-19 vaccine coverage in Thailand, providing baseline evidence for spatial health disparities in the country. Third, the cross-temporal comparison (2021&#8211;2022) captures the evolution of vaccine distribution strategies, documenting the transition from scarcity-driven allocation to community-based outreach. Fourth, the integration of spatial error modeling with policy-relevant covariates provides actionable insights for evidence-based vaccine distribution planning. These methodological and empirical contributions advance understanding of spatial health equity and provide a replicable framework for vaccine equity assessment in similar middle-income country contexts. This technique was used to reveal spatial influences on the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine coverage and to support explanatory modeling of geographic disparities. As a result, the researcher was interested in the study. The objectives of this study were to investigate spatial autocorrelation patterns and examine socioeconomic, demographic, and health service factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine coverage using explanatory spatial modeling. The results of the study will provide spatial COVID-19 vaccine coverage data and identify key determinants that could inform evidence-based strategies for improving vaccine distribution equity. Whether deciding to set policy, creating guidelines for developing the health service system, solving problems overall at the provincial level, as well as supporting manpower and resources for the work on immunization and prevention of COVID-19 in each area to be appropriate for the problem situation. To ensure that all citizens in every area in Thailand receive a comprehensive COVID-19 vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Spatiotemporal basis of the study</title><p id="Par9">This study was conducted from 2021 to 2022 in Thailand, Southeast Asia.

Explanatory spatial regression models were developed to examine the spatial associations of demographic, socioeconomic, and health service factors with COVID-19 vaccine coverage (2 doses) across provinces in Thailand. Variable selection employed a hybrid approach combining theoretical foundations with backward elimination. Initial variable inclusion was guided by theoretical frameworks from public health and spatial epidemiology literature, resulting in 22 theoretically relevant factors across three domains. Backward elimination was chosen over forward selection or stepwise approaches for several reasons: (1) theoretical completeness - starting with all theoretically important variables ensures no key predictors are overlooked; (2) multicollinearity assessment - allows systematic evaluation of variable interactions before removal; (3) spatial modeling compatibility - backward elimination is more stable with spatial autocorrelation present in the data; (4) policy relevance - retains variables with practical significance even if statistical significance is marginal. The elimination process prioritized theoretical justification over purely statistical criteria, removing variables only when both statistical insignificance and weak theoretical grounding were present. Determine the boundaries of areas that are connected using the principle of weight matrix using distance band format, with a radius of 111.247&#160;km, to identify nearby provinces (neighbors) in the analysis of spatial autocorrelation. This distance threshold was determined as the minimum required to ensure all provinces had at least one neighbor. The spatial weight matrix was row-standardized, and no population weighting was applied, treating each province as an equal spatial unit to examine geographic disparities across administrative boundaries. Multicollinearity assessment was conducted using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis, with all retained variables indicating acceptable levels of correlation between predictors.</p><p id="Par12">Moran&#8217;s <italic toggle="yes">I</italic> statistic is a test of spatial correlation, which will result in the form of analysis: global spatial autocorrelation presented as a Moran scatter plot.

Consequently, the government implemented strict containment measures in high-outbreak areas, leading to heightened public awareness and increased vaccine acceptance.

The novelty of our approach lies not only in methodological innovation but also in policy relevance. Unlike previous spatial health studies that focus primarily on disease distribution, our work demonstrates how spatial econometric methods can directly inform vaccine equity interventions through identification of Low-Low clusters and resource allocation priorities. The nighttime light application represents a methodological advancement that could be particularly valuable for vaccine monitoring in resource-limited settings where traditional surveillance data may be sparse.

By ordering and gradually importing from abroad. There were limited quantities, and distributing the vaccine to the public takes time. Our finding of negative association between population density and vaccine coverage was unexpected and may reflect Thailand&#8217;s specific context during 2021. Previous suggestions indicate that vaccine distribution strategies may have initially focused on areas with manageable population concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], though this contrasts with typical expectations where higher density areas usually have better healthcare access. This counterintuitive result may reflect several factors specific to Thailand&#8217;s 2021 vaccine rollout: (1) logistical challenges in densely populated areas during limited vaccine supply; (2) geographic prioritization strategies targeting specific economic zones or outbreak areas rather than population-based allocation; (3) administrative capacity limitations in managing large-scale vaccination in high-density areas during the initial rollout phase. Research in the United States has shown mixed associations between population density and COVID-19 vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This relationship requires further investigation to understand the underlying mechanisms. The contrasting associations between population density (negative) and nighttime light (positive) suggest a more complex relationship than simple urbanization effects. While both measures relate to development, they may capture different aspects of Thailand&#8217;s spatial structure. Population density includes various settlement types - from densely populated rural areas to areas with high economic activity- while nighttime light primarily reflects economic activity intensity and electrification. High NTL areas may represent economic hubs, industrial zones, or tourist destinations (such as Phuket, Eastern Economic Corridor) that combine infrastructure capacity with manageable population density for service delivery. Conversely, areas with high population density but lower economic activity may have faced greater logistical challenges during 2021&#8217;s limited vaccine availability. This relationship warrants further investigation with finer spatial resolution data to better understand the spatial structure of vaccine accessibility in Thailand. This suggests that infrastructure quality and economic development (nighttime light) were more important facilitators than population concentration per se during the initial vaccine rollout phase. Later in the year 2022, the COVID-19 vaccine had sufficient quantities, various types, and proactive services were available at the community level, allowing people to receive the COVID-19 vaccine thoroughly, especially the elderly group, which was the main target group for providing the greatest vaccine coverage (target 80%) to prevent, reduce the severity, and reduce the chance of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

Thus, in areas that had economic growth and were centers of doing business, there would be measures regarding COVID-19 vaccine coverage. For this reason, high-growth areas tend to have high vaccine coverage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Health service</title><p id="Par35">In terms of health services, from the results of the final explanatory model for both 2021 and 2022, it was also found that health workers were one of the important factors. The substantial effect size (4.26% points per additional health worker per 1,000 population in 2021) underscores the critical importance of healthcare workforce for vaccine coverage, suggesting that workforce redistribution could yield measurable improvements in coverage rates. Areas with a large number of health workers would be able to choose an easy and diverse strategy for providing COVID-19 vaccines. Because manpower could be allocated into multiple units to provide COVID-19 vaccine services to people in many areas, services could be provided in large numbers and quickly, so people did not have to wait long. Similar results in Romania showed that urban residents made up the bulk of those who received the COVID-19 vaccine, and health workers were important factors in people&#8217;s acceptance of the vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. And similar results to research in the United States showed that health workers were correlated with the COVID-19 vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, health workers were the first target group to receive vaccinations. They were a group at risk of contact with COVID-19 patients, and the vaccination of health workers also builds confidence and reduces concerns among the public [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Moreover, the results of this study found that areas with high COVID-19 cases would have high COVID-19 vaccine coverage. Consistent with research in Europe, receiving the COVID-19 vaccine depends on public awareness, the number of patients, and the chance of contact with COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The final explanatory model also found that COVID-19 vaccine coverage was negatively associated with COVID-19 deaths. Similar results were found in a study of COVID-19 vaccination coverage around the world, deaths among COVID-19 patients tend to gradually decrease as the vaccination coverage increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. And this was consistent with research in Hong Kong that receiving 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccination would help reduce the chance of dying from COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">When comparing the two years of analysis, interesting lights were found that average nighttime lighting and health workers were factors positively associated with COVID-19 vaccine coverage, with statistical significance both years. Model differences between years reflect Thailand&#8217;s evolving vaccine distribution strategy. The 2021 model emphasized epidemic response factors (COVID-19 cases and deaths) and basic accessibility indicators (transport, income), consistent with initial vaccine scarcity and priority allocation during the acute pandemic phase. The 2022 model focused on vulnerable populations (elderly) and digital infrastructure (internet access), aligning with expanded vaccine availability and community-based outreach programs that utilized online reservation systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Limitation</title><p id="Par37">However, this study has several limitations balanced by methodological strengths. First, this cross-sectional ecological design at provincial level limits individual-level inferences and causal relationships, though this approach aligns with Thailand&#8217;s administrative structure for policy implementation and provides actionable insights for resource allocation. Ecological fallacy represents a significant concern as provincial-level associations cannot be extrapolated to individual or sub-provincial relationships, and within-province heterogeneity may substantially differ from provincial averages. Second, different variables between years reflect genuine policy evolution rather than methodological inconsistency, capturing Thailand&#8217;s transition from vaccine scarcity to community-based distribution. Third, our spatial analysis treated provinces equally regardless of population size, ensuring rural and urban provinces received equivalent analytical attention for equity assessment. Fourth, age-aggregated data was necessitated by limited age-stratified provincial availability, though this provides overall coverage patterns relevant for administrative planning. Fifth, missing Bangkok data may affect spatial associations, though the remaining 76 provinces represent comprehensive national coverage. Sixth, contrasting population density and nighttime light associations require further investigation, though both variables contribute unique insights into spatial vaccine accessibility.</p><p id="Par38">Despite these limitations, our approach successfully captured evolving vaccine distribution policies and identified actionable spatial patterns. The integration of spatial econometric methods with policy-relevant covariates provides robust evidence for geographic targeting and resource allocation decisions at the provincial level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Recommendations</title><p id="Par39">Based on our spatial analysis findings, we recommend evidence-based strategies for equitable vaccine distribution planning. Geographic targeting should prioritize Low-Low cluster provinces identified in our LISA analysis, particularly northeastern (Bueng Kan, Amnat Charoen, Khon Kaen, Udon Thani, Loei, Nong Khai, Roi Et, Kalasin, Sakon Nakhon, Mukdahan) and southern border provinces (Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat), while leveraging positive spatial spillover effects by strengthening services in adjacent provinces.</p><p id="Par40">Operational implementation requires: (1) Healthcare workforce redistribution - establish incentive programs to relocate health workers from High-High cluster areas (Chonburi, Rayong, Samut Prakan) to underserved provinces, given health workers density consistently predicted vaccine coverage both years; (2) Infrastructure investment - prioritize internet connectivity expansion and mobile vaccination units in rural areas with nighttime light values below the 25th percentile; (3) Targeted service delivery - deploy enhanced outreach programs in the three chronically low-coverage southern border provinces where security constraints compound access barriers.</p><p id="Par41">National-level structural responses must address digital divide inequities through targeted broadband infrastructure investment, establish permanent regional vaccination capacity in chronically underserved areas, and implement dynamic approaches that can evolve from epidemic response strategies to vulnerable population focus based on pandemic phases. Service delivery frameworks should include proactive outreach for elderly populations and disabled individuals in remote communities, complemented by multi-channel communication campaigns and diverse vaccine options to reduce hesitancy across different regional contexts.</p><p id="Par42">Future research directions should prioritize age-stratified spatial vaccine coverage analysis to better align with targeted vaccination policies and identify population-specific barriers. National data collection systems should incorporate disaggregated spatial data by age groups to inform more precise and equitable distribution strategies. More information on monthly or quarterly changes since the vaccination introduction should be gathered in order to analyze temporal dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par43">The results of this analysis identified several important spatial associations with COVID-19 vaccine coverage in Thailand, indicating demographic, socioeconomic, and health service factors. By the year 2021, population density factors, average nighttime light, public transport vehicles, average household income, health workers, COVID-19 patients, and deaths were associated with COVID-19 vaccine coverage. Because it was the first year of the vaccine service. Vaccines were still limited, and services were only available in centralized areas. Later in the year 2022, the factors of elderly population, nighttime light, population internet access, and health workers were associated with COVID-19 vaccine coverage because there were sufficient quantities and various types of COVID-19 vaccines. Information supporting decision-making and a vaccine reservation system were disseminated via the internet. There were a variety of service locations, both public and private, and services were provided at the community level (especially to the vulnerable, which emphasizes proactive service). In addition, the government sector has issued measures to encourage people to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, which was a condition for returning to living a new way of life.</p><p id="Par44">The evolution of significant predictors from epidemic response factors in 2021 to vulnerable population and digital access factors in 2022 demonstrates the dynamic nature of vaccine equity determinants as policies and availability changed. Highlighting important findings that help us understand areas of COVID-19 vaccine coverage were the factors of nighttime lights and health workers. Because it was statistically significant in both years. In conclusion, provincial-level patterns indicate that areas with economic growth and high urbanization and areas with high health service manpower would affect the high coverage of COVID-19 vaccines in the area, though individual-level relationships may differ.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to express their sincere thanks to MOPH immunization Center, Ministry of Public Health, National Statistical Office, The Earth Observation Group, Ministry of Transport, National Health Security Office for publishing the provincial data for researchers to use in their studies and data analysis.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Author contributions: S.M. : Conceptualization, Investigation, Data analysis, Methodology, Writing &#8211; original draft review and editing.K.S. : Conceptualization, Methodology, Supervision, Writing &#8211; original draft review and editing.</p></notes><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></notes><notes notes-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data availabilityThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. https://zenodo.org/records/12680501.</p></notes><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar1"><title><bold>Ethics approval and consent to participate</bold></title><p id="Par45">Ethical clearance for this study was obtained from the Khon Kaen University Ethics Committee, in Khon Kaen, Thailand (reference no. 660201.2.3/1520 Project ID <ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-nucleotide" xlink:href="HE672054">HE672054</ext-link>).</p></notes><notes id="FPar2"><title>Consent for publication</title><p id="Par46">Not applicable.</p></notes><notes id="FPar3" notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par47">The authors declare no competing interests.</p></notes></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">World Health Organization.
