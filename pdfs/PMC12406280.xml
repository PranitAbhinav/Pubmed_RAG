The 30-second chair stand test (30CST) is a functional assessment that captures muscular strength and endurance in people with MS (PwMS). This study introduces Rotational Power (RP), which is a new metric derived from a single thigh-worn accelerometer, that can serve as a surrogate for body-mass normalized mechanical power during sit-to-stand (SI-ST) and stand-to-sit (ST-SI) transitions. We validate the metric both analytically and clinically in seventeen PwMS who performed a 30CST while instrumented with an accelerometer and a motion-capture system for reference. Analytical validation demonstrated a strong correlation with peak mechanical power for both SIST (r = 0.79) and ST-SI (r = 0.60). Clinical validation revealed strong-to-moderate significant associations between the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of peak RP computed across the 30CST and established clinical measures, including the number of repetitions, activity specific balance confidence scale, and modified fatigue impact scale. The same analysis performed on the motion-capture mechanical power showed similar results and concordance in correlation direction. Analysis of acute fatigue during the 30CST showed a significant decline in RP during the task, particularly for concentric transitions. Findings suggest that RP is a valid and practical metric for monitoring functional performance and acute fatigue in PwMS using a single wearable sensor, calling for its future use in free-living settings.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Index Terms</title><kwd>Sit to stand</kwd><kwd>wearables</kwd><kwd>lower limbs</kwd><kwd>functional status</kwd><kwd>fatigue</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><label>I.</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease that affects about 3 million people worldwide [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and whose etiology is still unclear [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Persons with MS (PwMS) suffer from an inflammatory cascade leading to demyelination of the axonal processes within the central nervous system, that progressively damages the neurons&#8217; ability to effectively communicate [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], negatively impacting sensorimotor function [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and increasing the probability of experiencing chronic fatigue [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated that the muscle groups in the lower extremities are disproportionately affected by MS [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], with a consequent decline in motor functions involving gait, balance, and functional capacity [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, MS is characterized by a relapsing-remitting nature and significant symptom fluctuations even outside of relapse events [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These symptom fluctuations suggest that long-term monitoring of the functional status of PwMS is crucial, as symptoms cannot be reliably assessed at infrequent clinical visits alone.</p><p id="P3">Among the many tasks necessary to maintain daily independence, the ability to make a postural transition from sitting to standing is of particular interest. In fact, a compromised ability to perform such a postural transition can be prodromic of a progressive decline in functional ability and increase risk of falling [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PwMS in general are less active when compared to those without MS, prone to experience chronic fatigue [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and perform fewer sit-to-stand transitions per day [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with an upper bound of daily sit-to-stand estimated at 50 for PwMS [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], compared to 71 for adults without balance or mobility impairment [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p id="P4">The functional status of PwMS is typically characterized during infrequent clinical visits using patient reported measures of dysfunction and sometimes objective functional assessments [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, symptoms in PwMS are known to fluctuate considerably throughout the day, and from one day to the next. When paired with issues in reporting and recall bias, it is likely that these infrequent assessments are not providing a comprehensive picture of the progression of MS symptoms, and particularly not in such a way as to enable preventative intervention. Moreover, this paradigm can be burdensome for PwMS, and particularly for those living in underserved communities that need to travel long distances to receive specialist neurological services [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Objective functional assessments that can be performed and assessed outside of a traditional clinical visit, hold promise for addressing many of these challenges.</p><p id="P5">The 30-second chair test (30CST) [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] has emerged as a suitable approach for characterizing muscular strength, fatigue, and functional capacity, while reducing the burden and risk for the participant when compared to more demanding alternatives, such as 6-minute walk test [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The test has been associated with lower limb strength in young [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and older adults [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and provides insights into the fall risk status of PwMS [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. One output that can be assessed during an instrumented 30CST and that is closely related to strength is mechanical power, which provides a proxy for determining one&#8217;s functional ability [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Decreased lower limb power generated during sit-to-stand tests has been associated with frailty, poor quality of life, increased risk of falling, hospitalization, mortality, and fatigue in older adults [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, quantifying mechanical power typically requires cumbersome and costly equipment, such as optical motion-capture systems and force platforms, rendering its computation impractical outside of specialized laboratory environments.</p><p id="P6">Wearable inertial sensors have already been employed for assessing transition characteristics in PwMS in the 30CST [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and could also be used for quantifying mechanical power. However, very few studies have explored the use of wearable sensors for quantifying sit-to-stand mechanical power [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These studies have all relied on inertial measurement units, which contain both an accelerometer and angular rate gyroscope, and have not explored transition power in PwMS. Gyroscopes, unlike accelerometers, are susceptible to time-varying measurement bias [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and have high power consumption [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which has traditionally prevented their use for long-term continuous monitoring. As a result, many remote activity monitoring technologies are accelerometer based. To the best of our knowledge, there are not yet validated algorithms for quantifying sit-to-stand mechanical power from just accelerometer data. Similarly, many large studies have included thigh-worn, accelerometer-based activity monitors (e.g., [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]), but methods for extracting sit-to-stand mechanical power from data collected at the thigh have not yet been developed.</p><p id="P7">Given these needs, in this work we introduce and validate a new quantity for characterizing sit-stand performance, <italic toggle="yes">rotational power</italic> (RP), which can be computed from a single thigh-worn accelerometer. We hypothesize that peak RP will be strongly associated with gold-standard body-mass normalized peak vertical mechanical power as measured by motion-capture during postural transitions. We further hypothesize that RP during the 30CST will capture constructs of balance confidence and fatigue in PwMS because of known relationships between the ability to generate power and daily functioning. Finally, we explore the ability of RP to quantify the acute fatigue effects of the 30CST.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><label>II.</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>A.</label><title>Sample Characteristics</title><p id="P8">This is a secondary analysis [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] that leveraged data from 17 PwMS (13F, 4M; mean &#177; standard deviation age = 50.5 &#177; 10.2 years; patient-determined disease steps (PDDS) = 0.9 &#177; 1.1; disability step: normal = 8; mild = 5, moderate = 2; gait = 2 [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]) with no other cause of balance and/or mobility impairment other than MS. Participants were included only if they were capable of walking unaided, not pregnant and/or breastfeeding, and if they did not present any form of hypersensitivity to adhesives. Sample demographics match the prevalence of MS in the broader population, with rates 3 times higher in females than in males [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This study was approved by the UVM IRB (Application Nos. STUDY00000401) and CHRSM (18&#8211;0285).

The battery of tests included timed-up-and-go, 30CST, stair ascent/descent, force plate walking, simulation of activities of daily living, standing balance, and 6-minutes walking test, with no prescribed rest between tasks except for the latter. For the purpose of this study, we focus on the 30CST by considering: i) the accelerometer placed on the medial portion of the anterior aspect of the participant&#8217;s left thigh; ii) two retro-reflective markers placed on left and right posterior superior iliac spinae (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), whose trajectories were used as an approximation of the participant&#8217;s vertical center of mass (CoM) displacement.</p><p id="P10">After being instrumented, each participant was asked to perform an orthostatic calibration trial, followed by a maximal effort 30CST. The 30CST was executed using a standard chair (height = 43.2 cm = 17 in), asking the participant to maintain their arms crossed on their chest while performing as many sit-to-stand transitions (SI-ST) as possible. The task started as the research assistant gave the &#8220;go&#8221; signal and ended after 30 seconds.

Filter cut-off frequencies were chosen so that the filtered signal retained at least 95% of the original signal energy. Positive and negative peaks were identified, representing the standing (maximum height) and sitting (minimum height) position of the participant, respectively. Each transition was labeled as SI-ST or ST-SI based on the intrinsic characteristics of peak-to-peak vertical displacement, (i.e., increase in height corresponding to a SI-ST).

We further analytically validate this new metric relative to gold-standard optical motion capture and clinically validate its ability to capture functional impairment due to balance confidence and fatigue and acute fatigue induced by the 30CST in PwMS according to the V3 framework [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Validation is performedin a sample of PwMS who are ambulatory without aid and exhibit relatively low levels of impairment due to fatigue or balance confidence.</p><p id="P23">Analytical validation demonstrated a strong association and a moderate to excellent agreement between RP and gold-standard VP for both SI-ST and ST-SI transitions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This finding supports the potential use of RP as a substitute for VP. This is important, given that reduced VP during postural transitions has already been associated with frailty, poor quality of life, and increased risk of falling, hospitalization, and mortality [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but it is difficult to assess outside of specialized laboratory environments. In contrast, RP can be assessed remotely using a single accelerometer, which could facilitate its application for more frequent assessments not only in clinical settings, but also potentially in home environments. This could enable more frequent remote monitoring of MS symptoms over time and more timely intervention. Beyond just MS, the development and validation of an algorithm for quantifying mechanical power from thigh accelerometer data could also be deployed in retrospective analyses to better understand functional impairment in large studies that have included thigh-worn, accelerometer-based activity monitors (e.g., [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]).</p><p id="P24">Clinical validation of the capacity to generate RP during the 30CST revealed important relationships with functional impairment due to balance confidence and fatigue (Table). Specifically, a reduced ability to generate RP was associated with decreased balance confidence and increased fatigue impact. These findings may imply a mechanistic relationship such that reduced capacity to generate RP reduces an individual&#8217;s ability to complete daily activities. Thus, measurements of RP capacity (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">RP95c</italic> during the 30CST) could potentially serve as objective markers of these impairments, and particularly because they are more strongly associated with these constructs than the traditional 30CST outcome #Reps.</p><p id="P25">While most associations were strongest for SI-ST transitions, <italic toggle="yes">RP95c</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">VP95c</italic> produced in ST-SI transitions were more strongly associated with #Reps than their counterparts in SI-ST transitions (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>). This could indicate that the 30CST may be biased slightly toward capturing the eccentric component of power in PwMS. Such a finding may point toward an association of eccentric power with the functional endurance and strength of participants. Indeed, a deficit in eccentric control has been shown to strongly limit the functional performance of an individual, and this appears to be particularly evident for PwMS [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p id="P26">Analysis of the MFIS sub-scores revealed a moderate to high association with SI-ST <italic toggle="yes">RP95c</italic> across all domains of fatigue impact. Interestingly, this trend was confirmed only for cognitive and psychosocial scores when considering ST-SI <italic toggle="yes">RP95c</italic>. Notably, the psychosocial impact of fatigue showed the strongest relationship with <italic toggle="yes">RP95c</italic> for both transitions. While this may be due in part to the fact that this sub-score is computed from only 2 of the 21 items from the MFIS, those items are also related to the impact that fatigue has on participating in daily activities. This relationship may also be impacted by a person&#8217;s ability to generate the power required to complete those daily activities.</p><p id="P27">The analysis of acute fatigue (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) demonstrates that RP captures the muscular fatigue induced during the 30CST [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Specifically, acute fatigue was observed as a decay in concentric (SI-ST) <italic toggle="yes">RP95c</italic>, which is in line with previous studies leveraging electromyography [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Interestingly, no decay was observed for its eccentric (ST-SI) counterpart. This discrepancy may be attributed to the intrinsic nature of the two transitions involved in the maximal-effort task. While the SI-ST transition is entirely active, the ST-SI transition is partially mediated by gravity [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Given that RP is computed as the product of angular velocity and angular acceleration, maintaining a constant movement kinematic is more feasible when gravitational assistance is present.</p><p id="P28">Acute fatigue during the 30CST causes changes in RP generated by participants, and these changes impact the relationship between RP and functional impairment due to balance confidence and fatigue. Splitting the 30CST into three 10-second windows, associations between MFIS and SI-ST <italic toggle="yes">RP95c</italic> peak during the middle time window (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The fact that these enhanced associations emerge later in the task may suggest that the 30CST could provide better assessment of impairment due to fatigue than shorter tasks (e.g., five times sit-to-stand test).</p><p id="P29">Despite including analytical and clinical validation of a novel measure of mechanical power, this study is not without several limitations. First, the study relied on a secondary analysis of a sample composed of a small number of PwMS, with no measure of the disease stage other than self-reported PDDS. In turn the sample presented limited mobility impairment (moderate-to-high balance confidence, low impairment due to fatigue, and low patient-determined disease stage). This should be addressed in future studies in samples with more severe mobility impairment. Moreover, in the current study spasticity was not assessed. Given the relationship between its severity and patient impairment, future studies on RP in PwMS should also investigate its impact. Furthermore, the study design prevents the assessment of test-retest reliability, and inter- and intra-participant variability. Next, despite the sensor was reoriented to align it with gravity while standing, no assumption can be made about the effect of each individual anatomical variability. In addition, we computed RP from one limb only, possibly hiding bilateral asymmetries. Finally, we consider only data from an in-lab 30CST, which may not reflect real-world performance and be influenced by the observer effect. Considering the association and agreement with VP that was found in the current study, future work should aim to examine 30CSTs performed outside the laboratory environment while unsupervised. Nonetheless, while the 30CST is a functional assessment with relatively low barriers to deploying outside of clinical contexts, doing so is still more of a burden for participants than purely passive monitoring of daily activities (e.g., [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). Future work should consider quantifying RP during free-living postural transitions and exploring how it relates to RP computed during the 30 CST. Given the promising results presented here, future work could also consider embedding RP as a part of a comprehensive daily mobility index that can be used to describe lower limb motor capacity across activities and how they contribute to general mobility impairment.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><label>V.</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P30">In this study, we introduce rotational power as new method for characterizing postural transition performance during the 30CST from a single thigh-worn accelerometer. To ensure that the method is fit for purpose, we present results from analytical and clinical validation in a sample of PwMS. Rotational power is shown to agree well with gold-standard vertical power derived from optical motion capture and be strongly associated with functional impairment due to balance confidence and fatigue. Finally, we demonstrate that rotational power during the SI-ST phase of the transition is able to capture acute fatigue induced by the 30CST, further emphasizing its utility as a marker of postural transition performance. These findings point toward future use of rotational power as a marker of functional impairment in PwMS, and potentially in other populations with symptoms impacting balance and mobility.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><p id="P31">This work was supported in part by U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) under Grant R21EB027852 and in part by the Grant from Medidata Systems.</p><p id="P32">This work involved human subjects or animals in its research.
