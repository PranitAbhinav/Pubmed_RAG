Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is a key procedure because of its diagnostic and therapeutic value. Understanding the clinical picture as well as the expected endoscopic variations in the area can potentially improve fatal complications. This study aimed to describe the clinical presentations, laboratory findings, and endoscopic patterns of affected patients in a tertiary bleeding centre in Khartoum, Sudan.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p id="Par2">A cross-sectional study was conducted at a bleeding centre in Khartoum, Sudan, and data from 513 patients presenting over 12 months were analysed. Demographic data, clinical presentations, laboratory investigations, and endoscopy outcomes were collected and analysed via appropriate tests at a 95% confidence interval (p value&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The study population comprised 369 males (71%) and 144 females (28%), with a mean age of 52 years. Esophageal and gastric varices were prevalent in 311 (60.6%) and 109 (21.2%) of the patients, respectively, whereas a total of 181 (35.3%) had a positive history of schistosomiasis. Esophageal and gastric varices were significantly associated with rebleeding (p-value&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Esophageal and gastric varices are the commonest endoscopic findings, with schistosomiasis present as a comorbid condition in one-third of patients. Both conditions are associated with significant recurrence rates. This study highlights the need to address the schistosomiasis burden in Sudan and recommends further studies to follow up on the progress of the condition.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Esophagogastroduodenoscopy</kwd><kwd>Varices</kwd><kwd>Schistosomiasis</kwd><kwd>Bilharziasis.</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="Par5">Authors:</p><p id="Par6">Upper GI Bleeding in Sudan.</p><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Sudan, with an approximately 5&#8211;10% mortality rate worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The incidence of UGIB is 80&#8211;150 cases per 100,000 people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract is five times more common than bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; mortality predictors include advanced age, haemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia), and comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Urgent interventions are needed to minimise the fatal risks of this type of emergency. Endoscopy is a well-established method for counteracting the effects of upper gastrointestinal bleeding urgently through methods of ligation or sclerotherapy. However, it is also a valuable tool for diagnosing less urgent causes of intestinal bleeding, such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease (gastric and duodenal), gastritis, duodenitis, and gastrointestinal malignancies.</p><p id="Par9">Limited data have been reported regarding risk factors and clinical presentation in Sudan, particularly in recent years. Our study was conducted to address this gap in knowledge and to obtain a better understanding of upper gastrointestinal bleeding patterns in the region. Acquiring serial data on this topic also helps guide and direct official policies.</p><p id="Par10">The study objectives were to describe the demographics of upper gastrointestinal bleeding patients, calculate the prevalence of common endoscopic findings and indications (clinical presentations) among them, describe laboratory findings, and test associations between different variables in a tertiary bleeding centre in Khartoum, Sudan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methodology</title><p id="Par11">This is a retrospective cross-sectional study carried out at a bleeding centre in Khartoum, Sudan, that explored medical records from January 2022 to December 2022. A total of 2078 emergency upper gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures were performed during those 12 months.</p><p id="Par12">The inclusion criterion for patients was emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy from January 2022 to December 2022 at the Mohammed Salih bleeding centre, with full endoscopic findings being reported. Any records that did not include esophagogastroduodenoscopy findings were excluded.</p><p id="Par13">Owing to the large volume of paper-based records and limited resources, it was not feasible to include all consecutive eligible patients. Instead, a modified systematic sampling approach was employed: every third patient file from the endoscopy logbook was selected for review. If a selected file was ineligible (e.g., not meeting the inclusion criteria), the next available eligible file was included. This approach was chosen to maximise efficiency while seeking to minimise selection bias under resource constraints. The cross-sectional design was chosen specifically to describe the clinical and endoscopic characteristics of patients and to identify associations between variables at a single point in time, as it is well-suited for these descriptive and analytical aims.</p><p id="Par14">Based on previous literature reporting 90% esophageal varices and assuming a 95% confidence level (Z&#8201;=&#8201;1.96) and a precision of 5% (d&#8201;=&#8201;0.05), the minimum required sample size was calculated to be 139 patients. To increase the study&#8217;s power and representation, we included 513 files according to the sampling method described above.</p><p id="Par15">Demographic data (sex, age, residency), clinical presentation, rebleeding episodes, clinical assessment, data about comorbidities, lab investigations, chronic medications, and endoscopic findings were recorded through a standardised digital Google form.</p><p id="Par16">Patients were first haemodynamically stabilised by intravenous fluids, antiemetics, proton pump inhibitors, vasopressors, vitamin K, and blood transfusions as required. Subsequent investigations, including complete blood count, coagulation profile, viral screening, and others, were performed as indicated. Patients were subsequently scheduled for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Variceal bleeders were sclerosed or band-ligated as appropriate. After endoscopy, haemodynamically stable patients were discharged within 2&#8211;3&#160;h unless complications occurred.</p><p id="Par17">Data were collected from a structured database, and entry was performed via Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences version 25. Numerical missing data were handled with multiple imputation under the assumption of missing at random (MAR), generating five imputed datasets. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the data. Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables are presented as the means&#8201;&#177;&#8201;standard deviations (SDs). A p-value&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.</p><p id="Par18">The chi-square test was used to examine associations between categorical variables (e.g., sex and the presence of esophageal varices). The unpaired t-test was used to compare continuous variables between two groups (e.g., haemoglobin levels in patients with and without schistosomiasis).</p><p id="Par19">

In 2021, a study reported that this endemic species migrated north towards Khartoum State as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">A high esophageal varices burden in Sudan has been reported in literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], consisting with our findings, which reported a percentage of 60.6% as the most common endoscopic finding among patients, although a reduction in comparison to previous records was noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], with a history of schistosomiasis being present in 35.3% of the study population.</p><p id="Par37">A figure that is lower than what was reported in previous local and regional reports. In rural sub-Saharan Africa, chronic hepatic schistosomiasis accounts for 94% of upper GI bleeders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In Tanzania, active schistosomal infection accounts for approximately 48% of patients who present with haematemesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. &#8203;A study conducted in Wad Madani, Sudan, reported that 93% of patients presenting with upper GI variceal bleeding consequent to portal hypertension had a past medical history of schistosomiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Whether this observation reflects improved public health policies, such as mass praziquantel campaigns and improved sanitation, or a selection bias, should be investigated.</p><p id="Par38">The majority of those patients had previously experienced at least one similar bleeding episode, and despite the sparsity of data on long-term recurrence rates, a 3-year recurrence rate was observed. Rebleeding as 2 episodes or more was observed in 57% of the patients in one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which is similar to the findings in our study (55%).</p><p id="Par39">Gastric varices constituted 21% of all cases, which, in most cases, were accompanied by esophageal varices. Isolated gastric varices were found in 27 (5%) patients. These results suggest an increase in the number of gastric varices, which might be due to increased sensitivity and improved reporting of their presence. Gastritis came after, aligning with the previously published literature on the change of gastrointestinal endoscopy of the Sudanese population towards gastritis in Sudan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A comparison between endoscopic profiles from different regions is described in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> below.</p><p id="Par40">A total of 13.3% of NSAID-takers in high-risk groups might reflect a lack of adjustment of risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In contrast, the number of patients who were taking beta blockers implies a pattern of noncompliance, as they were taken by 103 (20.1) individuals who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Adherence to beta-blockers and medication in low-resource areas can be attributed to the inability to meet costs, inaccessibility, and lack of proper awareness. The antihypertensive and hypoglycemic drug rates were 5.8% and 5.3%, respectively, reflecting the associated comorbidities.</p><p id="Par41">Findings suggest that our population is at high risk, as evidenced by the frequent presentation with moderate to severe anaemia, which is underestimated by possible selection bias after exclusion of patients with incomplete endoscopic findings because these particular groups might have presented very critically and died from severe bleeding before being stabilised for the procedure.</p><p id="Par42">The fact that 20% of the study population presented with gastric varices further highlights the urgency of their presentation, as gastric varices can lead to more severe and massive gastric bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Both gastric and esophageal varices were found to be significantly associated with higher.ecurrence rates in our findings. The literature suggests a 93.5% recurrence rate for esophageal varices within 3 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. All these factors highlight the importance of routine endoscopic screening and expanded access to secondary prophylaxis in high-risk populations.</p><p id="Par43">Differences in haemoglobin values between the schistosomiasis and non-schistosomiasis groups were not detected despite assumptions about the effect of schistosomiasis on baseline haemoglobin due to sequestration and iron deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is important to note that our findings represent associations only, and the cross-sectional design does not allow us to infer causality or assess long-term outcomes. These limitations should be considered when interpreting our results.</p><p id="Par44">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec103"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par45">This study was held in a specialised major centre for gastroenterology, with referrals from all over the country. The sample size was relatively large and represents the last record for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in Sudan prior to the recent conflict and provides a valuable reference for future studies, and the data were treated via proper statistical methods (multiple imputations).</p><p id="Par46">However, this study was conducted at a single centre, which may limit the generalisability of our findings. The retrospective design and not including all patients consecutively may introduce selection bias. We were unable to assess mortality or long-term outcomes. Despite addressing missing data using multiple imputations, this cannot fully compensate for all potential biases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec104"><title>Recommendations</title><p id="Par47">More efforts are needed to minimise schistosomiasis-related upper GI bleeding, and efforts are needed not only against a limited area but also against the entire population, as the modern lifestyle makes the spread of the endemic disease inevitable. Lifelong follow-up programs, including periodic ultrasound and endoscopy to initiate timely interventions, are recommended, especially for patients with a history of schistosomiasis or previous variceal bleeding. More studies need to be conducted to track epidemiological changes in the area to detect the postwar effects and to track the epidemiological changes associated with displacement and lack of access to healthcare</p></sec><sec id="Sec105"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par48">Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in our study population is strongly associated with esophageal and gastric varices and has a high recurrence rate. Schistosomiasis remains the most common comorbid disease among upper gastrointestinal bleeding patients, which highlights the need for targeted interventions to improve outcomes in limited-resource settings. Future multi-centre and prospective studies are warranted to further detect risk factors and improve prognosis for patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding in Sudan and similar endemic regions</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Special thanks to the Department of Surgery,&#160;Al-Neelain&#160;University, and Dr.&#160;Elsaggad Eltayeb&#160;Ahmed Mohammed,&#160;consultant of general and&#160;endoscopic&#160;surgery and associate Professor of surgery,&#160;Al-Neelain&#160;University, for providing supervision and filling knowledge gaps.
