They not only promote students&#8217; physical health but also influence the development of psychological and social skills through physical education. Recent studies have shown that PE teachers support students&#8217; overall well-being by fostering &#8220;physical literacy&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This not only involves improving motor skills but also includes understanding the importance of physical activity for health, cultivating positive health behaviors, and enhancing psychological resilience in coping with challenges and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The positive impact of physical education on students&#8217; mental health has also been widely recognized. Participation in physical activities helps reduce anxiety and stress, and through collaborative sports and team projects, students develop social skills such as teamwork and communication, which are crucial for their overall personality development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, PE teachers in China are often overlooked in the educational system, primarily because PE courses are seen as secondary subjects and do not receive the same level of importance as academic courses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This bias results in PE teachers being at a disadvantage in terms of resource allocation, career development opportunities, and social recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These factors significantly erode physical education teachers&#8217; job satisfaction and aggravate their occupational burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Burnout is a work-related syndrome caused by the prolonged mismanagement of occupational stress, and mainstream theory conceptualizes it along three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and diminished personal accomplishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The World Health Organization likewise defines burnout as a condition resulting from chronic workplace stress, chiefly manifested as energy depletion, negative detachment from one&#8217;s work, and a reduced sense of professional efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. From the perspective of the Job Demands&#8211;Resources (JD-R) model, when job demands surpass the resources available to an individual (e.g., energy, organizational support), resource depletion ensues, ultimately leading to emotional and cognitive exhaustion. Studies indicate that, as members of a highly interpersonal service occupation, teachers are especially prone to burnout; compared with teachers of other subjects, physical education teachers are more likely to experience symptoms such as emotional exhaustion and a reduced sense of accomplishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In addition, occupational stress among PE teachers is an area worthy of further exploration, as this profession has unique job demands and environmental pressures. PE teachers not only need to teach physical skills but also take on extracurricular activities, manage competitions, and perform additional duties. The physical labor involved and the responsibility for students&#8217; safety further increase their stress levels. These factors significantly affect PE teachers&#8217; job satisfaction and contribute to burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Such stress and burnout not only harm PE&#8217; physical and mental well-being, reduce the quality of instruction, and consequently affect students&#8217; learning experiences, but may also lead to an increase in teacher turnover, thereby negatively impacting the stability and normal functioning of the educational system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Most existing research focuses on burnout and mental health issues among the general teaching population, with relatively little attention paid to the specific group of PE teachers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, further research on the occupational stress and burnout of PE teachers will not only help improve their job satisfaction and work efficiency but also contribute significantly to enhancing the overall quality of physical education.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The relationship between occupational stress and burnout</title><p id="Par7">A considerable body of research indicates a significant positive relationship between occupational stress and burnout. Prolonged high-intensity occupational stress can lead to symptoms of burnout such as emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This relationship primarily arises because an individual&#8217;s psychological resources are overly depleted in high-pressure environments, rendering them unable to effectively meet work demands, leading to psychological and physical fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additionally, factors such as lack of job autonomy and social support in the work environment can exacerbate occupational stress, further increasing the incidence of burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, some studies have pointed out that moderate occupational stress can stimulate individuals&#8217; motivation, enhancing job performance and satisfaction, thereby reducing burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This phenomenon can be explained by the Yerkes-Dodson Law, which states that a moderate level of stress can enhance an individual&#8217;s attention and focus, contributing to optimized job performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Additionally, research by Cavanaugh&#8217;s team suggests that challenging job tasks can promote employees&#8217; positive coping strategies and professional growth, thus reducing feelings of burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, moderate stress can sometimes have a motivating effect and reduce the occurrence of burnout. Thus, while occupational stress can exacerbate burnout among primary and secondary school physical education teachers in some cases, its general effectiveness still needs further research and validation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mechanisms by which occupational stress influences burnout</title><p id="Par8">According to the Stress-Strain-Outcome (SSO) model by Koeske et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], stress induces strain (i.e., the destructive impact of stress on an individual&#8217;s psychological, physiological, and behavioral aspects), leading to various psychological, behavioral, and social problems as outcomes. In the SSO model, strain essentially acts as a mediating variable. Different studies have varied definitions of strain, with most considering it to be composed of cognitive and emotional elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study, occupational stress is treated as the primary stressor and occupational burnout as the eventual outcome, with PE teachers&#8217; psychological strain process situated in between. Following this theoretical framework, we posit that occupational stress triggers a cognitive-emotional chain reaction&#8212;first eliciting cognitive strain, then arousing emotional responses, and ultimately shaping burnout. Accordingly, we selected two representative strain variables, one cognitive and one emotional, for examination.</p><p id="Par9">Rumination was chosen as the cognitive strain mediator because it is a common and prototypical negative cognitive response in stressful contexts. Rumination refers to the repetitive immersion in thoughts about negative events and emotions, whereby individuals find it difficult to disengage from continual thoughts about the stressor. A substantial body of research shows that rumination is a maladaptive coping style that prolongs and magnifies negative affect and occupational burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Elevated daily stress is often accompanied by increased rumination, which intensifies subsequent negative emotion. Specifically within teaching, rumination has been shown to positively predict teachers&#8217; burnout levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Rumination thus effectively captures the cognitive stress-response pathway, and positioning it as a mediator helps delineate how occupational stress influences negative emotion and burnout via cognition.Negative emotion represents the emotional-response mediator. According to stress-process theory, individuals under occupational stress commonly experience anxiety, depression, anger, and other negative affects. These emotions constitute the direct emotional expression of stress and form the affective component of strain. In work settings, persistent negative emotion drains teachers&#8217; affective resources and gradually evolves into chronic fatigue and emotional exhaustion&#8212;core features of occupational burnout. Empirical evidence corroborates the tight link between negative emotions and burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This connection indicates that negative emotion functions as a crucial bridge between stress and burnout. Consequently, treating negative emotion as a mediator effectively captures teachers&#8217; typical emotional responses to stress and reveals how emotion channels the impact of stress on burnout.Together, rumination and negative emotion serve as representative cognitive and emotional mediators, aligning with the SSO model&#8217;s framework in which &#8220;stress leads to strain, leading to outcomes.&#8221; The resulting cognitive-emotional chain mediation path is logically clear: when PE teachers experience occupational stress, they first develop negative cognitions (ruminating on work difficulties), which in turn heighten negative emotions (e.g., frustration, anxiety), and the cumulative affective exhaustion eventually culminates in occupational burnout. Selecting these two variables helps operationalize abstract cognitive strain and emotional response&#8212;both rumination and negative emotion have well-validated measures and extensive empirical support&#8212;thereby enabling rigorous testing of the mediating mechanism through which stress exerts its effects.</p><p id="Par10">In summary, the primary objective of this study is to address the lack of attention in previous research regarding the occupational stress and burnout of PE teachers, thereby filling this gap in the field. Due to the unique characteristics of their work&#8212;such as intense physical labor, student behavior management, and organizing extracurricular activities&#8212;PE teachers face distinctive sources of stress that significantly impact their occupational health and burnout. This paper consists of two sub-studies. Study 1 employs a multiverse analysis to investigate the robustness of the relationship between occupational stress and burnout in a large sample. Study 2 uses a diary method to examine whether rumination and negative emotions mediate the effects of occupational stress on burnout. Specifically, the following hypotheses are proposed: Study 1: There is a robust link between occupational stress and burnout (H1). Study 2: T1 occupational stress leads to increased T2 rumination and T2 negative emotions over time, which in turn positively affect T3 burnout among PE teachers. Moreover, rumination and negative emotions not only act as individual mediators (H2 and H3) but also form a sequential mediation (H4).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study 1: relationship between occupational stress and burnout</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par11">The participants were from a large project focused on the mental health of primary and secondary school physical education teachers in mainland China. A cluster sampling method was employed, selecting 385 schools from 11 provinces and cities in the eastern and central regions of China in 2022. Surveys were distributed and collected at the school level. A total of 4800 questionnaires were distributed, and after excluding uncompleted or invalid responses, 4397 valid questionnaires were obtained. Among the participants, there were 2,863 males, accounting for 53.9% of the total. The average age was 30.81 years. The majority of respondents held a bachelor&#8217;s degree or higher, comprising 58.2%, followed by those with a junior college degree or below, who made up 41.8%. Participants with five years or less of teaching experience accounted for 52.2%, those with 6&#8211;10 years of teaching experience made up 26.1%, and those with more than 10 years of experience constituted 21.7%. The majority of participants came from public schools, representing 81.1% of the sample.Missing values were addressed using the EM imputation method, with a missing rate ranging from 0.30 to 8.20% and an average missing rate of 1.55%.

The scale consists of five dimensions: student-related stress, parent-related stress, exam-related stress, work-related stress, and career-related stress, comprising a total of 27 items. Example items include: &#8220;The school leadership does not support physical education&#8221; and &#8220;Concern about injury accidents during physical education classes.&#8221; The scale adopts a 5-point Likert scoring system, with responses ranging from &#8220;very stressful&#8221; (5 points), &#8220;quite stressful&#8221; (4 points), &#8220;moderately stressful&#8221; (3 points), &#8220;somewhat stressful&#8221; (2 points), to &#8220;not stressful&#8221; (1 point).

Sample items include: &#8220;I feel exhausted after a day of work&#8221; and &#8220;I feel disheartened by working in early childhood education.&#8221; The scale uses a 5-point Likert scoring system, ranging from 1 (&#8220;never&#8221;) to 5 (&#8220;always&#8221;). Items in the reduced personal accomplishment dimension are reverse-scored, while items in the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization dimensions are positively scored. A higher total score indicates a higher level of burnout among teachers. In this study, the Cronbach&#8217;s alpha coefficient for the scale was 0.91.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Demographic questionnaire</title><p id="Par14">A self-administered demographic questionnaire was used to collect participants&#8217; gender, age, teaching experience, grade levels they teach, educational qualifications, and the type of school they work in .</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Analysis procedures</title><p id="Par15">Because all data in this study were collected via self-report questionnaires, common-method bias could threaten the reliability of the results. We therefore implemented multiple strategies at both the design and analytic stages.Design-stage procedural controls. Item order was randomized and several items were reverse-worded to minimize systematic error stemming from fixed sequencing or uniform wording.Analytic diagnostics. We conducted Harman&#8217;s single-factor test to determine whether common-method bias was serious. All measured items were entered into an unrotated exploratory factor analysis; multiple factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 emerged, and the first factor accounted for less than the conventional 40% threshold of total variance. Hence, the present data show no evidence of substantial common-method bias (see Supplementary Materials for details).</p><p id="Par16">To reduce the subjectivity of single analytical decisions and to evaluate the robustness of our findings, we applied a multiverse-style analysis. This approach entails specifying all reasonable analytic choices&#8212;for example, different strategies for handling missing data, alternative variable codings, or varying sets of covariates&#8212;then running each analytic pipeline separately and synthesizing the resulting distribution of outcomes. Prior research demonstrates that multiverse-style analysis can reveal the stability or fragility of empirical findings and highlight sensitivity factors, thereby bolstering the credibility of conclusions (see Supplementary Materials for an extended rationale).</p><p id="Par17">The data possess a &#8220;participant (Level 1) &#8212; class/school (Level 2)&#8221; hierarchical structure. Ignoring this dependency and fitting single-level regressions typically underestimates standard errors and inflates statistical significance. We therefore computed the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which quantifies the proportion of total variance attributable to between-group rather than within-group differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The ICC calculation formula is as follows: ICC&#8201;=&#8201;&#964;<sub>00</sub> / (&#964;<sub>00</sub>&#8201;+&#8201;&#963;<sup>2</sup>), where &#964;<sub>00</sub> is the random-intercept variance and &#963;<sup>2</sup> is the residual variance.

For occupational stress and burnout, the null models yielded ICCs of 0.119 and 0.101, respectively, indicating that 11.9% and 10.1% of the total variance resided at the class/school level&#8212;above the common 0.05 benchmark and thus evidencing non-trivial between-group heterogeneity .All multiverse pipelines were estimated with multilevel models implemented in the specr package in <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Results</title><p id="Par18">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> displays the descriptive results of the multiverse-style analysis.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par21">The relationship between teachers&#8217; occupational stress and burnout has long been a central topic in educational psychology. Yet the empirical conclusions remain mixed, owing to methodological choices, control variables, and sample characteristics that differ across studies. Some scholars emphasize the moderating roles of contextual factors and individual resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], whereas others contend that the linkage between stress and burnout may be more complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Consequently, the field still questions the robustness of the stress&#8211;burnout association, underscoring the need for more comprehensive and rigorous analytic strategies.Compared with earlier single-equation regression studies, Study 1 adopted a large cross-sectional sample and implemented statistical inference across multiple analytic strategy combinations through multiverse-style analysis, thereby minimizing subjective researcher decisions and revealing more generalizable patterns. The multiverse-style analysis results showed that occupational stress consistently and significantly predicted occupational burnout under every analytic specification. Such stability provides a solid empirical foundation for inferring the authenticity of the stress&#8211;burnout relationship. Logically, if a relationship appears only under a particular model or assumption but disappears or reverses once analytic conditions change, it is likely a statistical artifact or methodological bias. In contrast, the present findings indicate that, regardless of which covariates are controlled or which measurement indices are used, the effect of stress on burnout remains positive and significant. This consistent pattern suggests that the stress&#8211;burnout linkage is an inherent association reflected by the data rather than a by-product of analytic decisions.</p><p id="Par22">The conclusion aligns with classic theoretical frameworks and extant empirical evidence. Both the JD-R model and the SSO model posit that high job demands deplete personal resources, leading to cumulative psychological strain that ultimately manifests as adverse outcomes such as burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Primary and secondary school physical education teachers face multiple occupational stresses in their work, mainly stemming from heavy teaching loads, challenges in student management, lack of career development opportunities, and high expectations from society and parents. These stress factors interact and lead to burnout among physical education teachers. Specifically, the heavy teaching tasks and intense physical labor place significant physical and psychological burdens on physical education teachers, leading to widespread emotional exhaustion due to prolonged high-pressure conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, challenges in student management, including dealing with students&#8217; misbehavior and maintaining classroom order, intensify teachers&#8217; psychological stress and increase the risk of depersonalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Finally, physical education teachers have fewer opportunities for career advancement, lacking clear promotion pathways and professional recognition, which makes it difficult for them to feel a sense of accomplishment in their jobs, further exacerbating symptoms of burnout related to low personal accomplishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study 2: intrinsic mechanisms through which occupational stress affects burnout</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par23">In Anhui Province, China, 35 schools were randomly selected, and 347 primary and secondary school physical education teachers were invited to participate in a preliminary assessment of occupational stress (T1). They then took part in a 21-day follow-up survey using the diary method, where they reported daily rumination (T2) and negative emotions (T2). A post-test (T3) on burnout was conducted at the end of this period. Participants who failed to respond for more than three days at T2 or T3 were excluded from the study. Ultimately, 324 participants remained valid for analysis. Among the respondents, there were 158 males, accounting for 45.7% of the total. The average age was 29.56 years. The majority of respondents held a bachelor&#8217;s degree or higher, making up 55.9% of the sample. Respondents with five years or less of teaching experience represented the smallest proportion, at 43.7%. Most of the respondents came from public schools, accounting for 72.8% of the total.Missing values were handled using the EM imputation method, with a missing proportion ranging from 0.30 to 8.20%, and an average missing rate of 1.55%.

This involves controlling for covariates and establishing a direct pathway from occupational stress to burnout among primary and secondary school physical education teachers. Rumination and negative emotions are then incorporated into the mediation model, constructing a path from rumination to negative emotions, thus forming a sequential mediation model. Statistical Testing Using Bootstrap The regression coefficients are tested for significance using Bootstrap resampling (5,000 samples), to obtain standard errors and 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals (CI) for parameter estimates. A <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value of less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant. The ICC values for occupational stress, rumination, negative emotions, and burnout are 0.011, 0.000, 0.014, and 0.027, respectively. According to McGraw et al.&#8216;s standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], these values are less than 0.05, which suggests a low level of data nesting by groups.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par32">Study 2 utilized the diary method to reveal the intrinsic impact mechanism between occupational stress and burnout from a time series perspective. Rumination plays a crucial mediating role between teachers&#8217; occupational stress and burnout. When faced with occupational stress, teachers often repeatedly contemplate the setbacks and challenges in their work, which makes it difficult for them to detach from the sources of stress, leading to emotional exhaustion and burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Research indicates that rumination not only prolongs the duration of stress but also amplifies its negative effects, resulting in the individual&#8217;s inability to effectively recover and cope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. For example, when teachers continue to think about classroom management issues or student behavior problems after work, their psychological and physiological recovery processes are disrupted, preventing them from obtaining necessary rest and relaxation, which further intensifies burnout. Additionally, rumination is associated with high levels of anxiety and depression, which can further exacerbate the state of teachers&#8217; burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Study 2 also identified the mediating role of negative emotions in the relationship between occupational stress and burnout among middle and primary school physical education teachers. Specifically, occupational stress exacerbates burnout by elevating negative emotions in these teachers. Occupational stress leads to various negative emotions in teachers, such as anxiety, depression, and anger, which in turn intensify the symptoms of burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Negative emotions not only directly impact teachers&#8217; psychological health but also diminish their job satisfaction and professional identity, thereby increasing the risk of burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Research shows that when faced with high workloads and complex student management issues, teachers often experience intense feelings of frustration and helplessness, which erode their psychological resilience and work motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This emotional response not only affects teachers&#8217; performance but also makes it difficult for them to recover and relax in their daily lives, creating a vicious cycle that further intensifies job burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Study 2 established a chained mediation effect of rumination and negative emotions between occupational stress and burnout among middle and primary school physical education teachers, indicating that occupational stress first increases rumination in these teachers, which then enhances their negative emotions, ultimately aggravating burnout. The JD-R Model provides a robust framework for explaining this phenomenon. According to the JD-R model, high job demands and low resource availability in the work environment lead to the depletion of an individual&#8217;s psychological and physiological resources, which in turn triggers burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this model, the balance between job demands and resources determines the levels of work pressure and burnout experienced by employees. When teachers face high levels of job demands, their psychological resources are excessively consumed, leading to increased rumination and negative emotions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Rumination involves repeatedly thinking about stress-related negative events, a pattern of thought that not only prolongs the impact of stress but also amplifies its negative effects, making it difficult for teachers to detach from sources of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This persistent psychological burden further erodes teachers&#8217; psychological resources, leading to emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, both key components of burnout. Negative emotions, as a form of psychological strain, are the direct result of high job demands and rumination. Such emotions, including anxiety, depression, and anger, not only affect teachers&#8217; psychological health but also diminish their job satisfaction and professional identity, thereby intensifying burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Notably, the direct effect of the independent variable (occupational stress) on the dependent variable (burnout) remains significant after the mediators are entered, indicating partial mediation. Theoretically, this finding means that the impact of occupational stress on burnout is not transmitted solely through rumination and negative emotion. Although these two mediators significantly convey the effect, they do not exhaust all operative mechanisms; occupational stress itself still retains a direct influence on burnout. On the one hand, high levels of occupational stress may directly drain teachers&#8217; physical and psychological resources (e.g., physical overexertion, emotional exhaustion), thereby triggering burnout without necessarily passing through rumination or emotional change. This aligns with Conservation of Resources theory: when stress is excessive and resources scarce, individuals suffer resource loss and energy depletion that directly precipitate burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. On the other hand, the presence of partial mediation implies additional unmeasured mediators or pathways&#8212;for example, work-environment factors (such as low social support or role conflict) or personal factors (such as coping style or physical fatigue) that intervene in the stress&#8211;burnout link. When such factors are not controlled, a residual direct effect of occupational stress on burnout is to be expected. This residual effect is consistent with the complex, multifaceted etiology of occupational burnout: among primary and secondary school physical education teachers, burnout is not shaped by a single pathway but rather by the confluence of multiple processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>General discussion</title><p id="Par36">This study explored the robust relationship between occupational stress and burnout among middle and primary school physical education teachers, as well as the mediating roles of rumination and negative emotions. Study 1 confirmed Hypothesis 1&#8212;that there is a robust and practically significant relationship between occupational stress and burnout, warranting attention from researchers and society. Study 2 confirmed Hypotheses H2, H3, and H4. Specifically, baseline occupational stress triggered an increase in rumination and negative emotions over time, which in turn exacerbated burnout at follow-up, with rumination and negative emotions also forming a chained mediation.</p><p id="Par37">In this research, by integrating the SSO model, we further enhanced the understanding of the pathways influencing burnout. Through the diary method design, this study revealed how rumination and negative emotions act as critical mediating links in the strain process, transmitting occupational stress to burnout. Particularly in daily teaching and teacher work pressures, this continuous psychological burden is not limited to short-term psychological stress responses but forms a long-term psychological stress state, which has a direct and profound impact on teachers&#8217; burnout. By conducting a detailed study of the occupational stress and burnout among middle and primary school physical education teachers, this research not only expands the existing theories in educational psychology and occupational health psychology but also provides empirical foundations and strategic recommendations for practically addressing stress issues in educational settings.</p><p id="Par38">This study inevitably has some limitations. First, it relied on self-report methods, which may introduce subjective biases. Second, there may be complex interactions between occupational stress, rumination, and negative emotions, rather than merely a unidirectional chained mediation relationship. For instance, in this study, the interaction between rumination and negative emotions could impact burnout, a topic that might be further explored in future research. Lastly, although multiverse-style analysis and longitudinal mediation provide effective methods for exploring causal relationships between variables, caution should still be exercised when interpreting ultimate causal relationships. Even with advanced statistical models, it is challenging to entirely eliminate all potential confounding variables or definitively prove causal relationships. In future research, we plan to employ rigorous experimental designs to explore the causal relationships between variables.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par39">This research, through two studies, explored the impact of occupational stress on burnout among middle and primary school physical education teachers and its underlying mechanisms. Occupational stress not only directly exacerbates the burnout issue in these teachers but can also achieve the same effect by elevating rumination and negative emotions.</p><p id="Par40">By accurately identifying and targeting key mediating variables of burnout, schools and education administrators can implement various strategies to help PE teachers manage rumination and negative emotions, thereby improving their job satisfaction and work efficiency. These strategies include, but are not limited to, providing mental health training and counseling to help teachers recognize and cope with rumination; organizing mindfulness training and offering emotional management skills workshops to teach teachers how to identify and manage negative emotions; promoting work-life balance by reducing administrative burdens and encouraging leisure activities to alleviate stress. Systematic interventions like these can enhance PE teachers&#8217; job satisfaction and teaching quality, ultimately promoting students&#8217; physical health and psychological development more effectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
