Some approaches treat the illness as something separate from the young person, placing the focus on the disorder rather than the individual. Enhanced Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT-E) takes a different view. It works from a psychological model, which means the eating disorder is seen as part of the young person&#8217;s thoughts and behaviours, but also something they can change. CBT-E helps teenagers take back control by involving them directly in their recovery. The therapy is supportive and collaborative, explaining how eating disorders are maintained and encouraging active decisions about change. Adolescents and therapists set clear goals and small tasks to practice between sessions. Parents are included as supportive &#8220;helpers,&#8221; but the main focus remains on building the teenager&#8217;s independence and long-term commitment to recovery.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40337-025-01390-z.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adolescent engagement</kwd><kwd>CBT-E</kwd><kwd>Eating disorder treatment</kwd><kwd>Patient autonomy</kwd><kwd>Motivation</kwd><kwd>Parental involvement</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Eating disorders are complex conditions often accompanied by severe clinical challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many individuals experience coexisting mental health disorders, frequently including personality disorders, and often face pronounced interpersonal difficulties and psychosocial impairment. Physical health complications are also prevalent, with medical conditions sometimes exacerbating the eating disorder&#8217;s psychopathology.</p><p id="Par5">Early and effective intervention is crucial to prevent long-term, potentially serious consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, engaging patients in treatment can be challenging, as many perceive their condition as egosyntonic<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> and may not recognize the need for help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Based on our clinical experience with adolescents with eating disorders, individuals with low body weight, such as those with anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa, rarely seek treatment voluntarily. Most enter therapy due to pressure from significant others. Those who seek treatment independently often do so to alleviate concerns related to eating, depression, or anxiety rather than to address low body weight, dietary restriction, or extreme weight-control behaviors. In contrast, adolescents who are not low weight but experience binge eating episodes, such as those with bulimia nervosa, often voluntarily seek treatment. However, most have the goal of stopping binge eating episodes and finding relief from eating concerns, depression, or anxiety, but do not address dietary restraint and other extreme weight control behaviors.</p><p id="Par7">Many patients use defensive strategies to avoid treatment, such as denial (e.g., failing to acknowledge underweight status, suppressing hunger cues) and ambivalence (e.g., skipping sessions, concealing dietary restrictions, artificially altering weight). Others justify their eating disorder behaviors as rational and personally meaningful choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Adolescents, in particular, are often in an extreme egosyntonic phase of their eating disorder, making them largely unaware of their condition. As a result, engaging them in treatment can be especially challenging.</p><p id="Par8">This therapeutic challenge has led to the development of treatment approaches that separate the illness from the individual&#8212;a concept referred to as &#8220;externalization.&#8221; This method enables parents and clinicians to take proactive steps against the disorder, regardless of the young patient&#8217;s readiness or willingness to participate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">In contrast, the adolescent version of enhanced cognitive behavior therapy (CBT-E) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] takes an individualized approach. It treats the disorder as an intrinsic part of the patient, encouraging them, rather than their parents, to assume responsibility for their recovery. CBT-E actively involves patients at every stage of treatment, fostering a sense of self-control. The patient makes key decisions, from initiating therapy to selecting specific problems to address and determining strategies. Building on this perspective, the adolescent version of CBT-E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] has incorporated distinctive techniques and strategies to enhance the teenage patient engagement and active participation in the treatment process, which are described in the present article.</p><p id="Par10">The NICE guideline has recommended CBT for eating disorders as an alternative option when eating-disorder-focused family therapy is unacceptable, contraindicated, or ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This recommendation was supported by promising results demonstrated by the CBT-E version, adapted for adolescents with eating disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Comprehensive guidelines for the adolescent-specific adaptation of CBT-E can be found in manuals designed for therapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, these resources are often lengthy, technical, or audience-specific, which can limit their accessibility and practical utility for clinicians seeking a concise yet clinically focused understanding of the approach. This article aims to provide a brief, integrative overview of the adolescent version of CBT-E, with a particular emphasis on the strategies and procedures designed to actively engage young patients in treatment and facilitate change&#8212;one of the most challenging aspects of intervention. By consolidating key CBT-E principles and engagement techniques into a single, accessible format, this paper fills a critical gap between comprehensive manuals and real-world clinical application, offering a practical and focused resource for clinicians, researchers, and trainees. In doing so, it aims to support the broader dissemination and implementation of adolescent CBT-E in diverse clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>CBT-E for adolescents with eating disorders: an overview</title><p id="Par12">CBT-E, an evidence-based treatment for adults with eating disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], is a transdiagnostic treatment that takes a personalized and flexible approach to target the mechanisms of eating disorder psychopathology operating in the patients rather than focusing on DSM diagnoses. CBT-E has been adapted to address the specific developmental and contextual needs of this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The rationale for adapting CBT-E for adolescents arose from two clinical observations: (i) adolescents and adults exhibit similar eating disorder psychopathology, including shape and weight overvaluation, dietary restraint, purging, excessive exercise, and body image concerns, an observation supported by network analysis research showing comparable psychopathology structures in adolescent and adult patients with anorexia nervosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; and (ii) adolescents, despite often experiencing an intense egosyntonic phase of their disorder, can actively participate in individual psychological treatment, as my colleagues and I have consistently observed over years of clinical practice.</p><p id="Par13">Additionally, CBT-E possesses several characteristics that make it particularly suitable for younger patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par14">The collaborative nature of CBT-E helps enhance the adolescent&#8217;s sense of control, making it especially fitting for younger patients who highly value autonomy, independence, and self-direction.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par15">Its structured yet flexible framework allows for an individualized approach, adapting to the unique physical and cognitive developmental stages of each patient.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16">The transdiagnostic design of CBT-E enables it to address all eating disorder diagnoses, making it effective for a wide range of adolescents who often place greater emphasis on controlling their eating habits rather than their body shape and weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par17">As an individual-focused treatment, it does not require full family participation, making it a viable option for adolescents whose families have limited capacity to be involved.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par18">While maintaining the core principles of the adult version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], this adaptation includes key modifications to ensure its effectiveness for younger patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, three key adolescent-specific factors required modifications.</p><p id="Par19">First, while adult CBT-E includes significant others only if the patient consents, parental involvement is essential in most adolescent cases to support treatment implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Second, many adolescents remain unaware of their disorder and are ambivalent toward the treatment. This feature has led to the development and inclusion of various strategies within CBT-E for adolescents aimed at enhancing patient engagement and addressing the common ambivalence young patients often feel about starting treatment.</p><p id="Par21">Third, since some medical complications linked to eating disorders&#8212;such as osteopenia, osteoporosis, growth delays, and structural or functional brain changes&#8212;can be particularly severe in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], regular medical check-ups and a cautious approach to hospitalization remain essential throughout CBT-E treatment.</p><p id="Par22">CBT-E for adolescents involves two assessment/preparation sessions, followed by three main steps, one or more review sessions, and three additional post-review sessions (see Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The duration of treatment varies depending on the nature of the patient&#8217;s eating disorder. For adolescents requiring weight restoration, therapy typically consists of 30&#8211;40 sessions, each lasting 50&#160;min, spread over a period of 30&#8211;40&#160;weeks. The exact timeline depends on the amount of weight to regain and the challenges the patient faces. For adolescents who do not require weight gain, CBT-E follows a similar framework but consists of 20 sessions over 20&#160;weeks. Those with milder eating disorder symptoms, such as binge-eating disorder or mild bulimia nervosa, may undergo a shorter treatment lasting 10&#8211;12 sessions over 10&#8211;12&#160;weeks. <table-wrap id="Tab1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table&#160;1</label><caption><p>The core elements of the CBT-E version for adolescents with eating disorders</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>Assessment and preparation</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;The aims are to assess the nature of the young person&#8217;s eating problem and engage them in the decision to begin Step One of CBT-E.&#160;This phase involves two appointments within one week and involves:</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;&#160;Assessing the nature and severity of eating disorder</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;&#160;Describing the difference between the disease and the CBT-E psychological models of eating disorders</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;&#160;Describing the nature and organization of CBT-E</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;&#160;Describing the nature and organization of CBT-E</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;&#160;Evaluating the pros and cons to start the Step One</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>Step One&#8212;Starting well and deciding to change</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">The aims are to engage the patient in treatment and change, including addressing weight regain.

The success of therapy hinges on building a strong therapeutic alliance, understanding the patient&#8217;s perspective, and fostering a collaborative approach.</p><p id="Par34">Establishing a connection from the very first session is essential for engagement and long-term success with CBT-E. Therapists should introduce themselves in a way that promotes equality and trust&#8212;asking the patient their preferred name and sharing their own&#8212;while maintaining professionalism and avoiding an intimidating or paternalistic demeanor. Emphasizing that the therapist is there solely to support the patient&#8217;s well-being, rather than acting on behalf of parents or other parties, helps establish a secure and trusting therapeutic relationship.</p><p id="Par35">For many adolescents with eating disorders, controlling weight, shape, and food intake is not just a behavioral issue but an integral part of their identity and perceived self-control. Acknowledging this reality is crucial. Instead of approaching patients with frustration or judgment, therapists should recognize that many do not actively seek help and may initially are very ambivalent toward the change. By practicing patience and avoiding stigmatization, therapists can create a space where adolescents feel understood rather than pressured. The challenges of change should also be validated, as extreme dieting and excessive exercise often serve as deeply ingrained mechanisms for self-evaluation, making them difficult to relinquish.</p><p id="Par36">Encouraging adolescents to reflect on the psychological mechanisms driving their disorder fosters deeper engagement in treatment. Therapists should honor each patient&#8217;s individuality, avoiding generalizations and recognizing their unique experiences. Supporting autonomy is crucial&#8212;forcing change upon an ambivalent patient often reinforces resistance. Instead, therapists can guide patients in exploring the perceived benefits of certain egosyntonic aspects of their disorder (e.g., low weight, dietary restriction) while gradually helping them recognize these as problems that need to be addressed.</p><p id="Par37">Promoting self-efficacy is essential in helping adolescents engage with treatment. Assigning tasks that match the patient&#8217;s current level of readiness can build confidence and empower them to take meaningful steps toward change. Framing change as an experiment&#8212;rather than a rigid, permanent decision&#8212;can also reduce anxiety by reinforcing the idea that adjustments can always be made. For those struggling with perfectionism, shifting the focus from rigid food control to active participation in treatment can feel more approachable and may encourage them to take ownership of the recovery process.</p><p id="Par38">Effective communication is central to fostering engagement in therapy. Early on, confrontation of irrational beliefs should be avoided in favor of building trust through active listening, summarizing the patient&#8217;s thoughts, and seeking clarification. Encouraging open dialogue by inviting questions helps create a sense of empowerment, while regularly checking for understanding guides patients toward forming their conclusions. Moreover, patients are more likely to accept difficult truths&#8212;such as the emotional and physical consequences of caloric restriction&#8212;when these are presented with respect and validated through their own experiences.</p><p id="Par39">Therapy should progress at a comfortable yet structured pace, ensuring that adolescents feel supported without undue pressure. Demonstrating genuine interest in the patient&#8217;s life outside their disorder can strengthen the therapeutic bond and encourage engagement.</p><p id="Par40">Striking a balance between empathy and firmness is essential&#8212;while certain treatment goals, such as achieving a healthy weight, are non-negotiable, acknowledging the emotional difficulties associated with change helps maintain a supportive atmosphere. Clearly explaining the structure of therapy&#8212;including session frequency, goals, and roles&#8212;can foster a sense of control and partnership. Instilling hope is equally important, reminding patients that while change is challenging, it is also achievable and rewarding.</p><p id="Par41">In cases where adolescents face severe medical complications, a more directive approach may be necessary in the early stages of therapy. In such instances, therapists must establish firm boundaries around self-destructive behaviors while maintaining a compassionate and supportive stance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Explaining the difference between the disease model and the psychological CBT-E model</title><p id="Par42">The therapist provides education on the key differences between the two primary theoretical models that explain why some young individuals persist in strict dieting or other extreme weight control behaviors, maintaining a low weight despite its negative consequences.

In this model, patients are viewed as being unable to control the illness and are therefore dependent on external control from parents or healthcare professionals. Treatment under this model involves a passive role for the patient, who is told what to do and must follow instructions to recover. This approach underpins treatments like FBT, medical interventions for eating disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and medical stabilization, which are commonly aligned with this perspective.</p><p id="Par44">On the other hand, the CBT-E psychological model offers a psychological explanation for the eating disorder, focusing on how the patient&#8217;s self-evaluation is primarily based on shape, weight, eating, and their control. This dysfunctional self-evaluation can make dieting and low weight feel rewarding despite their adverse effects. According to this model, patients are encouraged to understand how their eating disorder functions and recognize the dysfunctionality of their self-evaluation system. Rather than being told what to do, patients actively participate in treatment, working with the therapist to develop and implement functional solutions to change their mindset and behaviors. The goal is to help the patient regain a balanced and stable self-evaluation, ultimately leading to recovery. This approach is central to CBT-E, where the patient plays an active role in understanding the psychological processes that maintain their eating problem (including their perceived positive function of eating, shape, and weight), deciding to address them, and during the change process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Helping the patient understand the psychological maintenance processes</title><p id="Par45">Helping patients understand the psychological processes that sustain their eating disorder is a key part of treatment. This goal is achieved through the collaborative development of <italic toggle="yes">personal formulation</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">real-time self-monitoring</italic>.</p><p id="Par46">The initial formulation should focus on key eating disorder features and maintenance factors observed in the past 28&#160;days, avoiding excessive detail to prevent confusion. As treatment progresses, this formulation will be refined to incorporate additional insights.</p><p id="Par47">For adolescents with low weight, the therapist usually begins by discussing the negative consequences of being low weight, such as feeling cold or withdrawing from social activities. The next step is identifying the behaviors contributing to low weight, such as restrictive dieting or excessive exercise, and exploring the underlying reasons for these behaviors. Examining how these behaviors relate to the patient&#8217;s overvaluation of weight and shape is crucial. Additionally, the therapist highlights how the secondary effects of low weight further reinforce the disorder. For example, delayed stomach emptying may create a sensation of fullness, leading to stricter dietary restrictions. Dietary restriction can intensify preoccupation with food, fostering rigid eating rules. Moreover, weight-related social withdrawal may increase self-focus and reduce exposure to external perspectives that could challenge the patient&#8217;s beliefs about food, weight, and control. Body&#160;checking or avoidance behaviors should also be included in the formulation, as they often heighten concerns about weight and shape, reinforcing restrictive eating patterns.</p><p id="Par48">Another important aspect to include in the formulation is the adolescent&#8217;s sense of success in meeting self-evaluative goals related to controlling eating, weight, and shape, as this can help them understand why they may not perceive maintaining a strict diet and achieving a low weight as problematic. Additionally, some adolescents may experience other reinforcing factors, such as social approval for weight loss, increased parental attention, or avoidance of stressful situations at school, sports, or relationships (see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;1</label><caption><p>An example of a personal formulation collaboratively developed with a low-weight adolescent in Step One of CBT-E</p></caption><graphic id="MO1" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="40337_2025_1390_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par49">For adolescents who are not low weight but struggle with binge eating, the formulation usually starts by examining binge-eating episodes, their aftermath, and any compensatory behaviors. The therapist then explores the relationship between binge eating, rigid dietary rules, and emotional triggers. It is essential to understand why these dietary rules exist and how they are connected to the overvaluation of weight and shape. Finally, the therapist helps patients recognize how strict dietary rules contribute to binge eating, creating a cycle that reinforces their concerns about eating, weight, and self-control.</p><p id="Par50">Patients are encouraged to review their written formulation before the next session, reflect on its accuracy, identify missing elements, and suggest revisions. A unique feature of adolescent CBT-E is asking underweight patients to read a handout on the effects of low weight, which includes details about the Minnesota Starvation Experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. They are then invited to incorporate any newly recognized weight loss consequences into their formulation.</p><p id="Par51">Real-time monitoring is a core component of CBT-E. It requires patients to record their eating behaviors, related events, thoughts, physical sensations, and emotions in real-time using a structured monitoring record. This process helps patients identify and address the psychological mechanisms maintaining their eating disorder. Additionally, it allows for ongoing updates to the personal formulation as new maintenance processes emerge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Involving the patient actively in the decision to change</title><p id="Par52">A core strategy in CBT-E is to actively involve patients in the decision to begin treatment, commit to change, and address challenges along the way. This approach fosters engagement by ensuring that patients feel in control and actively participate in every phase of treatment.</p><p id="Par53">During the <italic toggle="yes">Assessment and Preparation Phase</italic>, after the assessment and an explanation of the principles of CBT-E, patients are encouraged to weigh the pros and cons of taking Step One of the treatment&#8212;without yet committing to change. Those who feel ambivalent are invited to &#8220;take the plunge&#8221; and try Step One as a trial. The focus at this stage is not on immediate weight regain but on understanding the psychological factors that maintain their eating difficulties and the potential implications of change.</p><p id="Par54"><italic toggle="yes">Step One&#8212;Starting well and deciding to change</italic> aims to build patient engagement in treatment and change, including discussion about weight restoration. A fundamental goal of CBT-E is for patients to choose to restore weight themselves rather than having it imposed upon them. This approach is particularly relevant for low-weight adolescent patients. Still, it can also apply to individuals experiencing binge-eating episodes who, despite not being low weight, exhibit egosyntonic eating disorder symptoms&#8212;such as excessive exercise, dietary restraint, or laxative misuse&#8212;that they may not perceive as problematic.</p><p id="Par55"><italic toggle="yes">Step Two &#8211; Addressing the change</italic> is carefully tailored to each adolescent&#8217;s unique psychopathology and the specific factors sustaining their eating disorder. The key objectives at this stage are facilitating weight restoration if needed and identifying and addressing the eating disorder psychopathology with specific modules. The strategies are highly individualized, depending on the patient&#8217;s specific challenges and needs. Patients play an active role in interpreting their weight trends, planning their eating to create a positive energy balance, and understanding strategies to address barriers to progress. For example, they collaborate with their therapist to establish a plan for achieving a steady weight increase of 0.5&#160;kg per week while addressing psychological obstacles that may arise.</p><p id="Par56">In <italic toggle="yes">Step Three&#8212;Ending Well</italic>, patients take the lead in developing a personalized long-term maintenance plan. This plan includes identifying situations that could increase the risk of setbacks, recognizing early warning signs of lapses, and outlining proactive strategies for managing triggers and preventing relapse. The emphasis is actively engaging the patient in recognizing setbacks early, responding effectively by &#8220;doing the right thing,&#8221; and applying problem-solving techniques to navigate challenges. By taking an active role in this process, patients build confidence in their ability to maintain progress beyond the structured treatment setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Agreeing on specific homework to complete between sessions</title><p id="Par57">Assigning homework has been identified as a pivotal strategy for enhancing treatment outcomes in CBT for eating disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and is considered essential for the success of CBT for bulimia nervosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. CBT-E incorporates various forms of homework, including real-time self-monitoring, written exercises, and behavioral tasks. These assignments can be challenging and provoke anxiety, requiring the therapist to provide empathic and firm encouragement while also considering the patient&#8217;s motivation and capacity to engage. Patients are made aware that recovering from an eating disorder is both demanding and rewarding, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing treatment.</p><p id="Par58">By engaging with these assignments, patients gradually recognize their role in recovery and their ability to implement meaningful changes. This sense of empowerment supports them in tackling challenging aspects of their eating disorder, such as binge eating, while also enhancing their self-efficacy and active engagement in the treatment.</p><p id="Par59">In our clinical experience, homework serves not only as a means of practicing skills and reinforcing learning but also plays a positive role in shaping the therapeutic relationship. One key mechanism underlying this association is the development of trust and collaboration. When therapists assign homework that is tailored, relevant, and aligned with the patient&#8217;s goals, it conveys respect for the patient&#8217;s agency and involvement in the therapeutic process. As patients engage with these tasks and experience positive outcomes&#8212;such as symptom relief or increased insight&#8212;they begin to perceive the therapist&#8217;s guidance as effective and trustworthy. This fosters a sense of credibility and alliance.</p><p id="Par60">Additionally, the therapist&#8217;s review of homework in subsequent sessions demonstrates attentiveness and genuine interest in the patient&#8217;s efforts, which further strengthens the relational bond. The collaborative discussion of difficulties or successes with homework encourages openness, reduces defensiveness, and deepens emotional engagement. Importantly, this reciprocal dynamic enhances the patient&#8217;s motivation and willingness to undertake more challenging cognitive or behavioral tasks, reinforcing both the therapeutic alliance and overall treatment progress.</p><p id="Par61">Homework, particularly real-time self-monitoring, plays a vital role in helping patients actively explore the psychological factors that sustain their eating disorder and initiate meaningful changes during Step One of CBT-E. In Step Two, these assignments are essential for targeting the core mechanisms perpetuating disordered eating. Lastly, in Step Three, homework focuses on equipping patients with the necessary skills to maintain progress and prevent relapse.</p><p id="Par62">Although homework assignments are initially guided by the therapist, the patient plays an active role in evaluating their usefulness and weighing the pros and cons of completing them. As therapy progresses and both parties develop a shared understanding of the psychological factors maintaining the disorder, the patient gradually takes greater responsibility for selecting tasks. These tasks may involve addressing maintaining mechanisms, such as reintroducing avoided foods, addressing body image concerns, or expanding self-evaluation criteria.</p><p id="Par63">Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> outlines the main homework tasks used in CBT-E for adolescents, tailored to each treatment phase to ensure active patient engagement and progress.<table-wrap id="Tab3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table&#160;3</label><caption><p>Main CBT-E homework for adolescents</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>Step One&#8212;Starting well</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Reviewing the personal formulation and including the symptoms that occurred after weight loss</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Self-monitoring in real-time</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Refraining from self&#8212;weighing at home</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Establishing regular eating</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Engaging in distracting activities that make binge eating less likely</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Riding out the urge (urge surfing)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Evaluating the short-term and long-term pros and cons of change</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>Step Two&#8212;Addressing the change</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic toggle="yes">Low weight and undereating module</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Planning the meal plan to regain 0.5&#160;kg a week</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Using cognitive behavioral strategies to address difficulties during meals</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Managing the time after eating</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic toggle="yes">Body image module</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Engaging in new domains of self-evaluation</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Identifying the various forms of shape checking</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Stopping non-normative forms of shape checking</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Addressing mirror checking</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Addressing comparison making</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Addressing shape avoidance</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Addressing spikes of body image concerns</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic toggle="yes">Dietary restraint module</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Identifying dietary rules</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Addressing dietary rules</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Addressing food checking</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic toggle="yes">Events, moods, and eating module</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Using proactive problem-solving</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Binge analysis</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic toggle="yes">Setbacks and mindsets module</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Identifying eating&#8209;disorder mindset reactivation triggers</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Spotting setbacks early on</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Displacing the mindset</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>Step Three&#8212;Ending well</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Phasing out certain treatment procedures</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Creating a personalized written short-term maintenance plan</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#160;Long&#8209;term maintenance plan</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Involving the parents as &#8220;helpers&#8221;</title><p id="Par64">Parents are encouraged to take part in their child&#8217;s treatment; however, their role is to create an optimal home environment that supports the adolescent&#8217;s progress.

When adolescents feel empowered and respected, their engagement in treatment tends to deepen, especially when parents work alongside them with mutual agreement.</p><p id="Par67">In our application of CBT-E with adolescents, we have also observed that family communication plays a central role in this dynamic&#8212;an observation that aligns with findings from previous studies employing different therapeutic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Healthy communication supports the adolescent&#8217;s emotional and psychological well-being, whereas dysfunctional patterns&#8212;such as blame, emotional manipulation, hostility, or belittling&#8212;can generate fear, resentment, and disengagement. These negative dynamics may lower self-esteem and increase resistance to treatment.

The adolescent version of CBT-E directly addresses these challenges by prioritizing patient involvement at every stage of treatment. Unlike more directive approaches that externalize the disorder and place primary responsibility on parents, CBT-E encourages adolescents to take ownership of their recovery while receiving structured support from therapists and caregivers.</p><p id="Par71">Engagement in adolescent CBT-E hinges on the therapist&#8217;s ability to build trust, validate the patient&#8217;s perspective, foster collaboration, and communicate effectively. By balancing empathy with necessary structure, therapists can create a therapeutic environment that empowers adolescents to actively participate in their recovery, ultimately enhancing treatment outcomes. The structured use of real-time self-monitoring, personalized formulation of maintaining factors, and collaborative problem-solving strategies ensures that patients understand and address their unique challenges in a meaningful way.</p><p id="Par72">Additionally, structured homework assignments tailored to each stage of treatment play a pivotal role in reinforcing active engagement. These assignments&#8212;ranging from real-time self-monitoring to cognitive restructuring exercises&#8212;encourage patients to take ownership of their progress outside of therapy sessions, fostering self-efficacy and accountability. By progressively involving adolescents in decision-making, from selecting goals to refining treatment strategies, CBT-E ensures that they develop a sense of autonomy and confidence in managing their eating disorder.</p><p id="Par73">Parental involvement is also strategically integrated to reinforce, rather than replace, the adolescent&#8217;s agency. When parents serve as &#8220;helpers&#8221; rather than &#8220;controllers,&#8221; they create an optimal environment for their child&#8217;s recovery while respecting their growing independence. This collaborative approach strengthens the adolescent&#8217;s commitment to change, making it more likely that they will sustain progress post-treatment.</p><p id="Par74">Although a study investigating predictors of CBT-E outcomes in adolescent outpatients did not identify baseline variables as significant predictors of treatment response or dropout (Dalle Grave et al., 2019), clinical experience highlights several additional challenges&#8212;beyond the commonly observed ambivalence toward change&#8212;that merit further investigation.</p><p id="Par75">External pressures such as academic demands, peer influence, and exposure to social media may function as stressors or reinforce eating disorder psychopathology. Addressing these factors within the CBT-E framework may require tailored interventions to help adolescents understand and manage their impact. Comorbid psychological difficulties&#8212;such as anxiety, depression, and self-harming behaviors&#8212;are also common in this age group and may complicate treatment. These issues may divert focus from core eating disorder features or require integration of additional therapeutic strategies. Parental involvement, while often necessary for support and accountability, presents another challenge. Striking the appropriate balance between fostering adolescent autonomy and engaging parental support can be complex, particularly given the variability in developmental maturity across this age range. The structured nature of CBT-E can itself present difficulties for some adolescents, particularly those who struggle with organization, attention, or emotional regulation due to developmental or environmental factors. Flexibility in delivery may be required to maintain engagement without compromising fidelity. Finally, CBT-E is only suitable for medically stable patients. However, given the potential for rapid medical deterioration in adolescents with eating disorders, close medical monitoring is essential throughout treatment. Where necessary, treatment may need to be paused or adapted, including referral for hospitalization to ensure medical stabilization.</p><p id="Par76">Future studies should also compare Enhanced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-E) with Family-Based Treatment (FBT) across the full spectrum of eating disorder presentations in adolescents. Such comparisons would provide valuable insights into treatment efficacy and inform personalized care by identifying key moderators and mediators of treatment response. To this end, a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT), the Norwegian CogFam study, is currently underway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Recruitment began in 2024 and targets adolescents aged 12&#8211;18 across eight outpatient clinics. The study directly compares CBT-E and FBT in terms of acceptability, effectiveness, and sustainability, while also aiming to identify moderators that could guide improved patient-treatment matching based on the distinct therapeutic mechanisms of each approach.</p><p id="Par77">In conclusion, adolescent CBT-E offers a patient-centered, engagement-driven approach to eating disorder treatment, recognizing that sustainable recovery is possible and effective when adolescents are active participants rather than passive recipients in their healing process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
