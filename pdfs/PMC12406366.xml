It contributes to the prevention of chronic diseases, enhances mental health, and improves quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For healthcare professionals such as nurses, who are frequently exposed to physical and emotional stress, maintaining an adequate level of physical activity is not only essential for their own health, but also crucial for their ability to provide safe and effective patient care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Ironically, despite being advocates for healthy lifestyles, nurses often struggle to engage in regular physical activity due to demanding work schedules, fatigue, and environmental constraints within the healthcare setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Nursing roles vary considerably depending on clinical settings, and these differences may impact their physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Emergency Room (ER) nurses often face high-acuity patients, fast-paced decision-making, and unpredictable workloads that can lead to both physical exhaustion and psychological strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In contrast, Outpatient Room (OR) nurses may experience more consistent routines, different patient interactions, and potentially less physical strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These contrasting work environments could lead to significant differences in activity levels and related influencing factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, limited research has directly compared physical activity patterns between nurses in emergency and outpatient departments, particularly in relation to occupational and socio-demographic factors such as workload in the room, age, length of work, gender, and carrier level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Different with previous research focusing on single settings or general nurse populations, this study provides a unit-specific comparison with actionable insight for tailored interventions. These two groups were selected due to their contrasting work characteristics: emergency nurses face irregular shifts, intense physical demands, and high-pressure environments, which can both enhance or hinder physical activity depending on fatigue levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Outpatient nurses, by contrast, typically work stable day shifts with lower physical demands and potentially more consistent opportunities for leisure-time activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Compared to other units like ICU or inpatient wards, emergency nurses are more physically active yet more strained, while ICU nurses, though under high psychological stress, may have limited movement due to patient monitoring tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This comparison provides insight into how sociodemographic factors shape physical activity patterns and supports the need for unit-specific health promotion strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Understanding how work environments influence physical activity among nurses is vital, not only from a health promotion standpoint but also in terms of workforce sustainability and patient care outcomes. Notably, studies suggest the temporal impact of work characteristics is not a problem in nursing because it is difficult to avoid, especially in emergency conditions such as COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These problems cause nurses&#8217; opportunities for physical activity to decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A meta-analysis conducted by Khani et al. showed that over the past two decades, sedentary lifestyles and lack of physical activity have been the main factors for various diseases (such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus) to occur in nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Identifying specific work-related determinants of physical activity can guide targeted strategies to support the health of nursing staff, especially in high-demand clinical settings.</p><p id="Par10">Despite growing awareness of occupational health in nursing, few studies have directly compared physical activity levels between ER and OR nurses, and none have comprehensively examined how work-related demographic factors in these settings. This gap is significant, as inadequate physical activity among nurses is associated with musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular risk, and decreased work performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This study aimed to assess and compare physical activity levels between emergency and outpatient nurses and to examine their associations with work-related demographic factors (age, length of work, unit/department, gender, and career level). The research was guided by two questions: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] What are the physical activity levels among emergency and outpatient nurses? and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] How are these levels associated with work-related demographic factors?.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par11">A cross-sectional correlational quantitative study approach was conducted from July to August 2023.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample/participants/informant</title><p id="Par12">This study was conducted in the nursing unit of a hospital in Bandung, Indonesia.

In the correlational analysis, we assessed the relationship between physical activity level and participants&#8217; characteristics, including gender, room, age, length of works and career level. It was found that nurses&#8217; physical activity level had a weak positive correlation with age (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.25; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.006) and lengths of work (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.24; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.010). No significant correlation were found with gender, unit room and career level (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Although the correlations between physical activity and both age and length of work were statistically significant, their strengths were weak. However, these weak positive correlation may reflect practical dynamics in the workplace. In some clinical settings, senior nurses with more experience are often entrusted with greater responsibilities and may be more actively involved in clinical tasks, patient care, or coordination roles. This cultural expectation may contribute to slightly higher physical activity levels among older or more experienced nurses, despite assumptions that younger nurses might be more physically active.</p><p id="Par21">

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par23">This study determined and explored the physical activity level of nurses and the demographic characteristics that might influence it. Our results show that the majority of nurses were categorized as having a high physical activity level, indicated by a MET score greater than 3000&#160;min per week. The finding is in line with another study In Indonesia which found the majority of nurses in the study have higher MET scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The cause of this finding might be the nurses&#8217; workload that needed to be done quickly and accurately, so the demands of their physical activities are very high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There are also certain factors that affect the overall level of physical activity among nurses, such as unit room, which is discussed in the following paragraph.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Unit room</title><p id="Par24">This study found that there was no significant correlation between the unit rooms (OR and ER) and their physical activity levels. Even though OR and ER have different responsibilities, hospital factors such as similar nurse-to-patient ratios and standardized task allocation policies may homogenize physical activity levels across units, effectively attenuating differences in physical demands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that nurse workload often varies between day and night shifts, depending on the number of patients and available staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Hospital policies that match staffing to patient numbers may reduce nurses&#8217; need for physical activity. Studies by Needleman et al. (2011) and the AHRQ review (Patient Safety Primer) show that consistent staffing ratios and work assignment policies across units systematically influence the distribution of workload and nursing activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">However, this finding contrast with Philbrick et al. (2022), who reported that nurses in ER have higher activity than those working in other areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. ER nurses are expected to be highly skilled because they handle emergency cases that require quick and accurate responses, whether surgical or non-surgical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Interestingly, ER nurses seem to use pacing strategies, adjusting their efforts during shifts to manage physical fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. One study shown that after doing moderate to vigorous activity in one shift, ER nurses showed reduced activity in the following shift, suggesting pacing behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. On the other hand, nurses in outpatient setting might have different routines, such as more frequent patient visits, which could increase physical activity. This finding is consistent with a study reporting increased physical workload in crowded and noisy service areas, such as the OR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The high workload of nurses affects their attitudes and intentions toward physical activity in their free time, allowing the data to become homogeneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, individual factors such as age, experience in the unit, and personal attitudes toward physical activity also determine the level of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Age</title><p id="Par26">This study shown a weak but statistically significant correlation between age and physical activity level among outpatient and emergency nurses. Most nurses in this study were aged 36&#8211;45 years, and physical activity levels tended to be lower in older age groups. This finding aligns with previous studies indicating that physical activity generally declines with age, partly due to age-related changes in muscle mass, physical endurance, and strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Several studies have supported this pattern, Chang &amp; Cho reported a significant association between younger age and a higher number of steps during a work shift (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similarly, Philbrick et al. found that nurses aged 18&#8211;34 years reported higher total weekly physical activity compared to those aged 35&#8211;54 and over 55 years, with the differences reaching statistical significance in the older age group comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. McCarthy et al. also reported that nurses aged over 40 years were significantly less likely to meet recommended physical activity levels at work compared to younger nurses [OR 0.47, 95% CI (0.25&#8211;0.88), <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.02] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Although physical activity is often reduced in older adults, the positive correlation found in this study suggests that other factors may contribute to increased activity among older nurses in Indonesia. In this context, older nurses often remain in physically demanding roles due to staff shortages and uneven workforce distribution. National demographic trends, including a growing proportion of older adults, may further contribute to continued workforce participation among older nurses, despite declining physical capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Moreover, differences in employment systems may also play a role. For example, in Indonesia, many nurses perform both nursing and non-nursing tasks, with over 90% reporting responsibilities outside core nursing duties. In the context of Indonesian healthcare settings, this may also be amplified by systemic factors such as limited staffing, high patient loads, as minimal support from auxiliary personnel, so all the nurses often undertake more physically demanding tasks. In contrast, nurses in some European countries often receive greater support from auxiliary staff, allowing them to focus more on essential nursing role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. For instance, a Finnish study among home care nurses reported that relative physical workload among older and younger nurses were comparable, importantly, there were no significant differences in perceived overall work ability across age groups, suggesting similar duty expectations regardless of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that in Indonesia there is a significant relationship between nurses&#8217; physical activity levels and their age.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Length of works</title><p id="Par30">This study found that length of work has an influence on physical activity levels. One possible explanation is that the shorter the unit experience was significantly associated with a longer distance traveled on all three shifts (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001 for all). This concludes that the higher the degrees are, and the longer the unit experiences, the higher the physical activity level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Nurses with a bachelor&#8217;s or higher degree had a higher number of steps on all shifts, and this difference was significant for the night shift (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.015) and all shifts (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.049) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Contrary to the South Korea study, it stated that nurses with a short tenure have higher physical activity than nurses with a longer tenure. This can be seen from nurses with less than one year of experience in the unit having an average number of steps of 11,000 steps or more, while nurses with three years or more of experience had 7,000 steps. Thus, the least experienced nurses walked about 40% more than nurses who had three or more years of experience. The differences may occur due to differences in competencies and roles according to length of service, such as nurses with less than one year of experience performing more direct nursing care than nurses with longer experience, and possibly a large amount of walking between rooms or due to missing necessary items due to lack of experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Career level</title><p id="Par32">The nursing career level is a structured process that assigns nurses to levels based on their knowledge and proficiency, while allowing them to refine their approach to align with their skills. Nurse performance and competency are positively impacted by the nurse career ladder system. In Indonesia, the professional nursing career path comprises four fields: Clinical Nurse, Nurse Manager, Nurse Educator, and Nurse Researcher. Each includes five competency levels. Clinical Nurse I provides basic nursing care under supervision with a focus on technical skills. Clinical Nurse II delivers holistic care independently and manages client groups with guidance for complex cases. Clinical Nurse III offers specialized care, develops evidence-based services, and facilitates clinical learning. Clinical Nurse IV manages complex cases using interdisciplinary approaches, conducts research, and advances clinical education. Clinical Nurse V provides expert consultations, leads transdisciplinary clinical governance, and conducts research to develop nursing practice, education, and the profession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">The results of this study showed that there was no significant relationship between career level characteristics and nurses&#8217; physical activity levels. This finding is quite contrasting with previous studies, even though there are no previous studies that mention the specific relationship between career level and the physical activity of nurses. It is known that the likelihood of nurses meeting prescribed amounts of physical exercise at work and in their own time was more than doubled for those with high quantitative demands, meaning that higher career levels may usually experience higher quantitative demands, which increase the amount of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In Indonesia, nurses&#8217; career levels are not directly linked to physical activity, as advancement is based more on education, experience, competence, and managerial duties than on job physicality. Physical activity is influenced more by task type and work setting than by career rank for instance, a senior ER nurse may be more physically active than a higher-ranking nurse manager. Moreover, according to Minister of Health Regulation No. 26 of 2019, all nurses with a valid registration certificate and practice license are authorized to perform the same duties, regardless of career level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strength and limitation</title><p id="Par34">This study offers several strengths. It addresses an underexplored area by directly comparing physical activity patterns between emergency and outpatient nurses, two groups with distinct occupational demands in high-intensity clinical environments. The analysis incorporated multiple work-related demographic factors: age, gender, length of work, and career level, providing a nuanced understanding of determinants of nurses&#8217; physical activity. The use of standardized metabolic equivalent (MET) scores enhanced measurement precision and facilitated comparability with previous studies. Moreover, the findings have practical relevance for occupational health by identifying subgroups that may benefit from targeted interventions, offering baseline evidence to inform institutional policy and guide future longitudinal or interventional research.</p><p id="Par35">However, its cross-sectional correlational design precludes causal inference, and observed associations may reflect reverse causation or selection bias. Physical activity was self-reported, introducing the potential for recall and social-desirability bias, with limited ability to differentiate between occupational and non-occupational activity domains. The single-institution sample limits generalizability to other nursing populations or healthcare systems with different organizational structures, shift patterns, and cultural norms. Finally, unmeasured factors such as workload intensity, shift type, and access to exercise facilities may have confounded the associations. These limitations should be considered when interpreting the results, and confirmatory studies using longitudinal designs, objective activity monitoring, probability-based sampling, and comprehensive confounder assessment are warranted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par36">This study highlighted that most emergency and outpatient nurses reported high levels of physical activity. Significant associations were identified between physical activity levels and both age and length of work, suggesting that these demographic factors may have played a role in influencing nurses&#8217; engagement in physical activity. However, no significant relationships were detected with other demographic variables.
