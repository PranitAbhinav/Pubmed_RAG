Senescent cells contribute to various pathological and physiological processes including organismal ageing and cancer. Cellular senescence can be induced by various cellular stresses including DNA damage, telomere shortening, oncogene activation, and epigenetic alterations. We have shown that plasma membrane damage can also induce cellular senescence. However, common and specific molecular mechanisms among different senescent cell subtypes remain unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate mRNA and rewire gene expression profiles, contributing to multiple processes including cellular senescence. Here, we performed time-resolved miRNA sequencing and compared the results with mRNA sequencing results using cells experiencing plasma membrane damage-dependent senescence (PMD-Sen) and cells undergoing DNA damage response-dependent senescence (DDR-Sen). We found 65 miRNAs that are differentially regulated in PMD-Sen, contributing to 2,495 miRNA-mRNA pairs. Moreover, PMD-Sen and DDR-Sen shared 41 miRNAs across their sets of miRNA-mRNA pairs. Notably, miR-155-5p emerged as the miRNA with the largest number of shared miRNA-mRNA pairs that exhibit a highly negative correlation. These results highlight miR-155-5p as the potential key regulator of PMD-Sen and DDR-Sen.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Small non-coding RNAs</kwd><kwd>cellular senescence</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane damage</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd></kwd-group><support-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JSPS KAKENHI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20H03440</award-id><award-id>24K02233</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JST-COI- NEXT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJPF2205</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JSPS A3 Foresight Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPJSA3F20230002</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI under Grant Numbers [20H03440, 24K02233], JST-COI- NEXT JPMJPF2205, and JSPS A3 Foresight Program JPJSA3F20230002 to K.K. as well as JSPS DC2 fellowship [24KJ2182] to Y.C.</funding-statement></funding-group></support-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><ref-count count="65"/><page-count count="19"/><word-count count="7169"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" disp-level="1" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular senescence, originally described by Hayflick, initially referred to a state of stable growth arrest resulting from the limited proliferative capacity of normal human fibroblasts [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. After serial passaging, the normal human diploid fibroblasts reach replicative exhaustion and stop dividing in vitro. In 1990, Harley and his colleagues demonstrated that this type of senescence, known as replicative senescence (RS), was associate with telomere shortening [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Cellular senescence can also be triggered in response to various stressors, including oxidative stress, unresolved DNA damage and oncogene activation [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although different stressors lead to senescence, the DNA damage response (DDR) is commonly involved in these mechanisms [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Senescent cells are metabolically active and resistant to apoptotic signals [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6&#8211;8</xref>]. Senescence features are recognized by a combination of phenotypes, including flattened and enlarged cell morphology; increased activity of senescence-associated &#946;-galactosidase (SA-&#946;-gal), the development of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which is the secretome consisting of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix proteins; and an increase in cell cycle inhibitors such as p53 and p16 [<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Cellular senescence is beneficial to the organism in some contexts including embryonic development, tissue remodelling and tumour suppression. However, cellular senescence can also be deleterious in other contexts including ageing and tumour progression [<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we showed that plasma membrane damage-dependent senescence (PMD-Sen) is a novel senescence subtype that is induced by transient plasma membrane damage [<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The plasma membrane can be damaged and lose its integrity when exposed to stress, such as pore-forming toxins secreted by invading pathogens or during the normal physiological process of muscle contraction [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Since plasma membrane damage is ubiquitous in the human body [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], further understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of PMD-Sen would potentially contribute to developing a treatment to extend healthy life span.</p><p>Cellular senescence is accompanied by large-scale gene expression changes [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15&#8211;17</xref>]. One of the major regulators underlying such gene expression changes are microRNAs(miRNAs) [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs consisting of 18&#8211;24 nucleotides and were initially discovered in the nematode <italic toggle="yes">C.elegans</italic> by the Ambros and Ruvkun groups in 1993 [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The majority of miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) into primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNA) in nucleus. These pri-miRNAs, which can be more than 1 kb, contain a hairpin structure where the miRNA sequences are located. Many pri-miRNAs undergo capping and polyadenylation processes [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Following transcription, pri-miRNAs are processed by a microprocessor complex, which includes the nuclear RNase III enzyme Drosha and DGCR8, resulting in the formation of stem-loop precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) with a length of approximately 70 nucleotides [<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The pre-miRNAs are then transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the export receptor Exportin-5 and further processed by an RNase III endonuclease, Dicer [<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In cytoplasm, cleavage to the terminal loop of pre-miRNA by Dicer generates the approximately 22-nucleotide miRNA duplex with 2-nucleotide 3&#8217;overhangs. Through interaction of miRNA seed sequences (nucleotide 2&#8211;7) with the 3&#697;-untranslated region (3&#8217;UTR) of the target mRNAs, miRNAs usually repress gene expression by conducting mRNA degradation and/or inhibiting protein translation. It has been estimated that over 60% of the human protein-coding genes contain at least one conserved miRNA-binding site, indicating that miRNAs serve as a mechanism by which genes with diverse functions can be simultaneously regulated [<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, miRNAs are believed to play essential roles in diverse biological processes, including development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The capabilities of miRNAs in controlling various biological processes enable miRNAs to be tools to explore the key pathways that govern specific cell fates [<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we focused on miRNA &#8211; mRNA interactions as a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism contributing to senescence. Although the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of senescence has been extensively investigated [<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the role of miRNAs in orchestrating subtype-specific senescence remains insufficiently understood. By integrating time-resolved miRNA and mRNA expression profiling, we sought to identify both shared and subtype-specific miRNA &#8211; mRNA regulatory axes. We identified 2,495 negatively correlated miRNA &#8211; mRNA pairings involving 65 miRNAs that are regulated in PMD-Sen. Moreover, PMD-Sen and DNA damage response-dependent senescence (DDR-Sen) shared 41 miRNAs across their sets of miRNA-mRNA pairs. Notably, miR-155-5p exhibited the largest number of shared target mRNAs with strong negative correlation, suggesting a central role in regulating core aspects of the senescent phenotype.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0002"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2" id="s0002-s2001"><title>The induction of plasma membrane damage-dependent senescence and DNA damage response-dependent senescence in WI-38 normal human fibroblasts</title><p>We previously showed that plasma membrane damage can induce cellular senescence (PMD-Sen) in normal human fibroblasts including WI-38 cells and BJ cells in vitro, and performed the time-resolved mRNA seq analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE222400">GSE222400</ext-link>) [<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Here, we aim to identify the miRNAs that would underly the mRNA expression changes that were identified in our previous work. WI-38 cells were treated with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-containing medium for 24&#8201;hours, washed away, and incubated with DMEM for additional 16&#8201;days. As a control, we utilized DNA damage response-dependent senescent (DDR-Sen) cells that were induced by doxorubicin (DXR) treatment for 24&#8201;hours (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Both PMD-Sen cells and DDR-Sen cells displayed the well-established cellular senescence feature of increased SA-&#946;-gal staining positive cells (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>). SA-&#946;-gal staining suggests that senescence progressed over time, with senescent cells dominating the culture by D8. PMD-Sen cells and DDR-Sen cells showed increased senescent cell marker proteins, including p53, p21, and p16, in addition to the decrease of lamin B1 (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Increase in p16 and decrease in lamin B1 were also observed in another senescent cell control, replicative senescence (RS) cells, that were induced by repeated cell division and reached at least population doubling level of 50. The increased levels of p53 and p21 suggest that the senescence process began on D2 in PMD-Sen cells and on D0 in DDR-Sen cells. Moreover, increased mRNA levels of SASP factors, <italic toggle="yes">CCL2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MMP1</italic>, were observed (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Collectively, these results confirm successful cellular senescence induction.

Based on the thresholds of <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 and absolute log2 Foldchange&#8201;&gt;&#8201;1, we detected 134 and 179 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in PMD-Sen and DDR-Sen, respectively, when compared to the untreated control (Ctrl) (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Analogously, a total of 7822 and 9263 DE mRNAs were identified in PMD-Sen and DDR-Sen, respectively (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). To further characterize the unique miRNA profile in different subtypes of senescence, we performed a comparative analysis of the compositions of DE miRNAs among PMD-Sen, DDR-Sen, and RS. The UpSet diagram illustrated the numbers of unique DE miRNAs in each senescence subtype, highlighting senescence subtype-specific DE miRNA expression patterns. For instance, in PMD-Sen, 22 upregulated miRNAs were observed at D16, of which 7 miRNAs were exclusively upregulated at D16 in PMD-Sen rather than at any other time points or in other subtypes (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and Supplementary Table S1). Among the downregulated miRNAs in PMD-Sen, 4 of a total 25 downregulated miRNAs at D16 were identified as unique signatures of PMD-Sen_D16 (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and Supplementary Table S2). These observations suggest that miRNA profiles may be dependent on the subtypes of senescence. Furthermore, several senescence-associated miRNAs were identified, which verifies our analysis methods (<xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For instance, miR-664a-3p [<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], miR-486-5p [<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the miR-30-5p family [<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and miR-335-5p [<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which have been previously reported as upregulated in senescence, were also found to be increased in our dataset. Conversely, miR-17-5p [<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], miR-106b-5p [<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and miR-625-3p [<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which are known to be downregulated in senescence, were also consistently downregulated in our analysis.

In PMD-Sen, Cluster 1 exhibited a highest level at D0, followed by a gradual decline towards D16, and was associated with endoplasmic reticulum protein processing. Cluster 2 peaked at D1 and then decreased, with enrichment in glycerolipid metabolism. Cluster 3 was initially downregulated at D0 and D1 but gradually increased over time, and was associated with ECM&#8211;receptor interaction, protein digestion, and the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. Cluster 4 displayed a rapid upregulation at D0, with a subsequent increase, and was associated with immune system functions and disease-related pathways. Cluster 5 exhibited a sharp downregulation at D0 and the lowest expression at D16, with enrichment in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and homologous recombination. Cluster 6 exhibited the lowest expression at D0, followed by a gradual increase, and was enriched in actin cytoskeleton regulation and Rap1 signalling. Cluster 7 showed a downregulation peak at D0, increased at D1, and then slowly declined, primarily associating it with gap and tight junction processes.

Cluster 3 showed a decrease at D0 and D1, followed by an increase over time, similar to PMD-Sen Cluster 3, and was associated with cytokine &#8211; cytokine receptor interaction. Cluster 4 demonstrated a continuous decline and was linked to transcriptional regulation, metabolism, and disease-related pathways. Cluster 5 was upregulated at D0 and maintained a high expression, with enrichment in calcium signalling. Cluster 6 declined from D1 and was involved in protein digestion and metabolic pathways.

Additionally, the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis suggests that different senescent cell subtypes utilize distinct regulatory pathways.

For example, in PMD-Sen, the genes in Cluster 3, 4, 5 and 6 were targeted by a minimum of 14 miRNAs. In PMD-Sen_Cluster 7, there was an enrichment of targets specifically from miR-940. In the case of DDR-Sen, Clusters 1, 3, 4, and 5 individually showed enrichment for targets of at least 25 miRNAs. Furthermore, miR-3176 and miR-296-3p had their targets specifically enriched in DDR-Sen_Cluster 7 and DDR-Sen_Cluster 8, respectively.

Furthermore, several miRNAs have been reported as senescence-associated miRNAs [<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In this study, we performed time-resolved miRNA profiling in PMD-Sen, a recently discovered senescent cell subtype, utilizing human fibroblast WI-38 cells. To establish the interactome of miRNAs and their target mRNAs in PMD-Sen, an integrative analysis was performed based on miRNA and mRNA expression profiles and miRNA-mRNA databases (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). This approach aimed to shed light on the potential regulatory mechanisms by which miRNAs modulate the expression of mRNAs implicated in PMD-Sen. Although a limited number of cases demonstrating positive correlation patterns between expression levels of miRNAs and mRNA targets have been reported [<xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], miRNA target prediction is frequently supported by utilizing the inverse correlation between miRNAs and their target mRNAs [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In our analysis, we used miRNA-mRNA pairs exhibiting negative correlation as the principal components in the construction of regulatory networks.</p><p>In the PCA analysis of the time-series miRNA profiles, we observed that the miRNA expression profile at D0 (after 24&#8201;hours of senescence induction treatment, prior to washout) had the least similarity to other time points, and the miRNA signatures subsequently progressed towards replicative senescence. This pattern suggests that the differentially expressed miRNAs at D0 might be implicated in the initial response to plasma membrane injury, rather than in the induction of PMD-Sen. Furthermore, the miRNAs expressed from D1 (1-day post-washout) through D16 (16&#8201;days post-washout) potentially function as regulators of the induction and maintenance of PMD-Sen. Additionally, an increase in the number of differentially expressed miRNAs was observed over time following plasma membrane damage, suggesting a temporal correlation between these dysregulated miRNAs and the progression of PMD-Sen. Comparative analyses between PMD-Sen, DNA damage response-dependent senescence (DDR-Sen), and replicative senescence (RS) revealed both shared and unique miRNAs, supporting the idea that senescence subtype &#8211; specific stressors induce distinct regulatory mechanism (Supplementary Figure S3; Supplementary Table S6 and S7). For example, while DDR-Sen and RS rely on DNA damage response signalling, PMD-Sen does not exhibit detectable DNA damage at early stages [<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This distinction is reflected in the differential miRNA signatures. miR-1260b was uniquely upregulated at D0 in PMD-Sen, but not at later stages or in DDR-Sen or RS, suggesting its potential role in the acute response to membrane damage. In contrast, miRNAs such as miR-27b-3p, miR-146b-5p, and miR-126-3p were upregulated at PMD-Sen-D16, DDR-sen-D16 and replicative senescence, suggesting their involvement in general mechanisms of senescence. In a related study, Wang et al. [<xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] identified eight miRNAs that were differentially expressed across senescent cell subtypes: replicative, ionizing radiation-induced, and busulfan-induced senescence. Furthermore, they observed at least 20 miRNAs that were uniquely differentially expressed in each senescent cell subtype. Consistent with their findings, our comparative analysis suggests that distinct miRNA dysregulation patterns may vary depending on the trigger of cellular senescence, while certain miRNAs potentially function as universal regulators of multiple senescent cell subtypes.</p><p>Soft clustering of temporal mRNA expression profiles unveiled the dynamic nature of gene expression patterns in PMD-Sen and DDR-Sen. Notably, a substantial proportion of these genes were identified as putative targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs, indicating a potential involvement of miRNA-mediated regulation in the mechanisms underlying senescence. Through the construction of miRNA-mRNA networks and subsequent functional annotation, we identified the miRNAs that potentially play crucial roles in the response to plasma membrane damage and the mechanism underlying PMD-Sen. For instance, the initial transient upregulation of genes at D0 in PMD-Sen_Cluster 1, governed by miRNAs such as miR-495-3p, which was previously linked to protein folding [<xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], suggests an adaptive mechanism involving endoplasmic reticulum protein processing immediately after plasma membrane damage. Notably, <italic toggle="yes">DDIT3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HERPUD1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">HSPA6</italic> were among the most strongly upregulated genes (log&#8322;FC&#8201;&gt;&#8201;3, adjusted <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). The rapid, transient upregulation of genes, such as <italic toggle="yes">IL1B</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">AREG</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">CSF1R</italic>, at D1 in PMD-Sen_Cluster 2, primarily targeted by miRNAs like miR-101-3p, miR-143-3p, and miR-148-3p, highlights their potential role in PMD-Sen through modulation of the MAPK signalling pathway, a well-established regulator of cellular senescence [<xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr">55&#8211;57</xref>]. PMD-Sen_Cluster 3 was initially downregulated and gradually increased, and was association with the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. Previous study by Astle et al. [<xref rid="cit0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] demonstrated that activated PI3K-Akt induced senescence independently of DNA damage, consistent with our previous observation of the absence of detectable DNA damage during early PMD-Sen [<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PMD-Sen_Cluster 4 exhibited a rapid (D0) and sustained upregulation, associated with PPAR signalling pathways, which plays a crucial role in regulating lipid metabolism and promoting cell survival [<xref rid="cit0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. PMD-Sen_Cluster 5 was enriched in cell cycle and DNA replication, indicating roles in senescence establishment and/or maintenance. It is noteworthy that the genes in DDR-Sen_Cluster 2 also showed significant enrichment in cell cycle and DNA replication pathways, and predominantly comprised genes that were putative targets of 3 miRNAs (miR-126-3p, miR-30e-3p, and miR-35-5p), which are different from PMD-Sen. These observations suggest the presence of distinct miRNAs functioning in cell cycle and DNA replication processes across PMD-Sen and DDR-Sen pathways. PMD-Sen_Cluster 6 revealed the lowest levels at D0, followed by a gradual upregulation from D1 to D16, and was enriched in actin cytoskeleton and Rap1 signalling, suggesting involvement in cell adhesion and motility [<xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="cit0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. PMD-Sen_Cluster 7 demonstrated a significant reduction in gene expression at D0, which was followed by an increase at D1 and a gradual decline thereafter. This cluster was primarily linked to gap and tight junction pathways. In contrast, Cluster 8 reached its highest expression at D0, decreased at D1, and subsequently returned to levels akin to those of untreated cells (D-1). The genes in this cluster were identified as predicted targets of miR-374b-5p and miR-7-5p. KEGG analysis revealed an enrichment in pathways related to amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, which are crucial for protein synthesis [<xref rid="cit0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. These observations suggest that miR-374b-5p and miR-7-5p may contribute to the regulation of early protein synthesis in response to plasma membrane damage.</p><p>Of particular interest, miR-155-5p emerged as a potential common regulator impacting multiple clusters across both PMD-Sen (Clusters 3, 4, 6) and DDR-Sen (Clusters 1, 3), and its expression was downregulated in all senescence models including RS. Its predicted targets &#8211; such as <italic toggle="yes">CCND2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MXI1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">CYB5D2</italic>&#8212;were upregulated in all three subtypes and are known to participate in cell cycle arrest, stress responses, and senescence-associated signalling, suggesting the involvement of miR-155-5p in senescence regulation. The upregulation of early senescence markers, p53 and p21 occurs prior to the decrease in miR-155-5p (<xref rid="f0001 f0006" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B-D and 6C,D</xref>). These results support the interpretation that the decrease in miR-155-5p most likely contributes to the maintenance, but not the induction, of senescence. In BJ cells (another normal human fibroblast), we found that the increase in SA-&#946;-gal staining positive cells was slower in PMD-Sen cells than in DDR-Sen cells, and miR-155-5p decreased on D8 in DDR-Sen cells but not in PMD-Sen cells (Supplementary Fig S4A-C). These results are consistent with the idea that the downregulation of miR-155-5p occurs during late senescence.</p><p>In addition to the miRNAs predicted to regulate temporally clustered mRNAs, identified through soft clustering, we conducted a separate analysis of KEGG pathway enrichment using subtype-specific miRNA &#8211; mRNA pairs, regardless of whether the mRNA targets were included in the clustering (Supplementary Table S4 and S5). This analysis aimed to elucidate broader subtype-specific regulatory programs. PMD-Sen-specific miRNA &#8211; mRNA pairs exhibited enrichment in pathways such as FoxO signalling, PI3K-Akt signalling, and TNF signalling, which are implicated in cell survival, oxidative stress responses, and inflammation &#8211; characteristics of non-genotoxic stress adaptation. In contrast, DDR-Sen-specific pairs were enriched in the p53 signalling pathway, Fanconi anaemia pathway, and cellular senescence, aligning with canonical DNA damage responses and checkpoint activation. Moreover, shared miRNA &#8211; mRNA pairs between PMD-Sen and DDR-Sen were enriched for the AGE-RAGE signalling pathway, which integrates inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell survival. miR-155-5p emerged as a central node in this network, but other shared miRNAs (e.g. miR-126-3p, miR-369-3p, miR-495-3p) also targeted genes within the pathway, highlighting a cooperative regulatory network within the pathway associated with cell fate determination. Collectively, these findings complement the soft clustering-based analysis and highlight how both dynamic and subtype-specific regulatory axes contribute to senescence.</p><p>We recognize several limitations in this study. First, the use of only two biological replicates per time point for miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq. While we applied multiple layers of analysis to strengthen the findings, future studies with experimental validation will be essential to confirm these observations. Second, while we identified potential regulatory interactions, such as miR-155-5p targeting <italic toggle="yes">CCND2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MXI1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">CYB5D2</italic>, direct physical interactions were not assessed. Third, the consequences of miR-155-5p downregulation should be further investigated by assessing SASP expression and SA-&#946;-gal activity. These validations will be important for confirming the underlying mechanisms in future work.</p><p>Overall, the comprehensive analysis of time-series miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq data elucidates miRNA-mRNA interaction and uncovers miRNA-mediated mechanisms that appear to play a significant role in PMD-Sen progression.
