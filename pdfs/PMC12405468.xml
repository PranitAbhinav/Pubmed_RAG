This innovative membrane was created using solution casting and electrospinning techniques to enhance its surface area and hydrophilic characteristics, while incorporating photocatalytic properties for light-induced oil decomposition. The membrane structure was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The effectiveness of the membrane was measured in terms of the oil rejection and fouling resistance under continuous cross-flow conditions in a laboratory-scale filtration setup. The PGTS membrane demonstrated exceptional performance, surpassing both pure PVDF and commercial membranes, with a 99% oil rejection rate and 8% flux increase. Notably, the membrane maintained high emulsion separation efficiency even after 100&#160;h of uninterrupted operation.The synergistic interaction between the PVDF matrix and the surface-functionalized nanomaterials&#8212;specifically GO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, and SiO<sub>2</sub>&#8212;enhanced the membrane&#8217;s separation performance and resistance to fouling.

These emulsions attitude significant environmental hazards and economic complications due to their perseverance and opposing effects on environments and human health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Conventional separation methods, as well as gravity separation centrifugation, flotation, coagulation and chemical processes, often be unsuccessful to accomplish the essential efficiency and sustainability. These methods often exhibit significant limitations including low separation efficiency, high energy consumption, sensitivity to oil droplet size, and poor performance with stable emulsion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Consequently, membrane-based separation technologies have expanded consideration as a practicable alternative, proposing improved selectivity, scalability, and lower environmental impact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In latest years, in attendance has been angrowing focus on the growth of progressive composite membranes aimed at tackling the intricate challenges associated to the separation of oil-in-water emulsions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These membranes utilize the synergistic properties derived from the combination of diverse materials to improve separation efficiency, permeability, and resistance to fouling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Ultrafiltration membrane separation technology is mainlyvaluable for the management of oily wastewater, especially because of its efficiency in eliminating emulsified oils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Conversely, representative polymers used in the manufacture of ultrafiltration membranes, such as polysulfone (PSF), poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and polyethersulfone (PES), retainintrinsicoleophilicfeatures. This affinity leads to high reactivity with oil contaminants, resulting in quick diffusion and adsorption of oils on membrane surfaces, which in turn gives to severe membrane fouling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, the advancement of anti-fouling ultrafiltration membranes is necessary for enhancing to enhance the effectiveness of membrane technology in the treatment of oily wastewater. Amongst the many materials that have been explored for membrane production, Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has concernedimportantattention due to its outstanding mechanical properties, chemical stability, and adaptability to numerous operational environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Much development has been made in the production of mixed matrix membranes to incorporate titanium dioxide into the polymer matrix of membranes. Remarkable methods include the consumption of photocatalytic reactors alongside cross-flow filtration, immersing membranes within slurry reactors, and applying titanium dioxide coatings or embedding them within the membrane structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. TiO<sub>2</sub> Nanoparticles exhibits chemical inertness, retains a high refractive index, and reveal antibacterial properties through a range of spectra. Furthermore, they are corrosion-resistant, non-toxic, and cost-effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. TiO<sub>2</sub> enhances the PVDF membrane through a combination of photocatalytic self-cleaning, increased hydrophilicity via surface hydroxyl groups, and mechanical reinforcement, making it a key contributor to the membrane&#8217;s superior separation and antifouling performance. Hydrophilic particles, such as graphene oxide (GO) and silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), can be applied to the PVDF membrane to improve the permeability, resulting in hydrophilicity enhancement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Graphene and its derivatives, especially graphene oxide (GO), are considered highly promising for filtration applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, due to their large surface area, excellent mechanical and thermal stability, and hydrophilic nature. These properties make GO particularly suitable for membrane fabrication, enabling efficient separation and adsorption performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. These properties facilitate the development of steady dispersions in aqueous environments, production it a appreciated component in modifying water membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. SiO<sub>2</sub>, an inorganic compound well-known for its excellent thermal and chemical stability, also displays high hydrophilicity, which donates to reduced fouling and enhanced membrane permeability.Additionally, In addition, silica particles with reduced dimensions have a higher ratio of external surface area to volume, which increases membrane performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Researches specify that the use of GO-SiO<sub>2</sub> composites as a membrane structure material results in high hydrophilicity, which improves water permeability of the membrane. Conversely, the absence of silica and graphene oxide composites results in substandard hydrophilic properties, which reduces membrane permeability. These results build on the previous study cited in the research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The incorporation of TiO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles into the GO matrix achieves numerous functions. First, it increases the surface area of &#8203;&#8203;the membrane, which improves its interaction with oil droplets and leads to enhanced separation efficiency. In addition, the hydrophilic properties of TiO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub> improve the wettability of the membrane, which leads to reduced fouling and increased permeability. Furthermore, this incorporation donates the membrane with photocatalytic capabilities, tolerating it to degrade oil contaminants upon exposure to light. For example, Ma et al. reported a similar decrease in contact angle from 72&#176; to 59&#176; after modifying a PVDF membrane with GO and polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, resulting in increased fouling resistance and separation efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Similarly, Lu et al. demonstrated a notable decrease in contact angle from 82.72&#176; to 67.37&#176; following the modification of a PVDF membrane with nanosilver (Ag) and nanozirconium dioxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), which improved antifouling properties and prolonged operational stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In this study, the effects of TiO<sub>2</sub>@SiO<sub>2</sub>@GOnano fillers on the membrane structure and permeability performance were comprehensively observed through a comprehensive series of characterizations, such as morphological analysis, contact angle evaluations, and separation performance evaluations, to regulate its efficiency. The results designate that the developed composite membrane exhibits improved efficiency in separating oil-in-water emulsions, as well as increased permeability and greater resistance to fouling compared to the conventional membrane. This research represents a significant advance in membrane technology, with potential applications spanning crosswise a diversity of industries, containing wastewater management, oil spill cleanup, and petroleum refining operations. By on condition that a sustainable and efficient attitude to separating oil-in-water emulsions, these composite membranes showanenergetic role in promoting environmental sustainability.The novelty of work lies in the synergistic design of a composite membrane that offers improved separation efficiency and stability, while the fabrication process is carefully optimized and validated to ensure scalability and quality consistency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Material</title><p id="Par3">Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with 99.5% purity was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Surface modification</title><p id="Par8">The prepared membranes were subjected to post-fabrication surface functionalization to enhance hydrophilicity and reduce fouling. The membranes were dipped in an ethanol solution containing 2 wt% (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) for 4&#160;h at room temperature (RT). The APTES modification was performed after membrane fabrication to specifically target the outer membrane surface, where interactions with oil-in-water emulsions occur. This strategy allows for uniform amine group grafting on the membrane surface, improving water affinity and anti-fouling performance without disturbing the bulk membrane structure. Following silanization, the membranes were thoroughly washed with ethanol and dried at 50&#160;&#176;C for 2&#160;h to remove any residual APTES. This clarification emphasizes the role of APTES in membrane surface modification while confirming that the nanoparticles were incorporated in their as-prepared state. The antifouling mechanism arises from both the inherent hydrophilicity of the nanoparticles (TiO<sub>2</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, GO) and the APTES-induced surface functionalization.

This configuration allows for easy membrane replacement and operational parameter modification. The composite membrane, with a diameter of 20&#160;cm and a thickness of 1&#160;mm, was securely positioned within the filtration unit, ensuring proper orientation and sealing to prevent leaks. An oil-water emulsion was prepared by blending 500 mL of crude oil with 1&#160;L of water (resulting in an oil concentration of 33.3% v/v) using a high-shear mixer for 30&#160;min, which was then introduced into the filtration unit through the entry port. The emulsion had an average droplet size of ~&#8201;10&#160;&#956;m. Prior to testing, the membrane was pre-treated by compaction at 1.5&#160;bar for 30&#160;min using deionized water to stabilize its structure and remove any residual solvents or impurities. The system was operated at room temperature (25&#160;&#176;C) with pressure maintained at 1&#160;bar. The emulsion was circulated through the membrane under controlled conditions at a flow rate of 10&#160;L/min. The volume of separated oil was continuously tracked and recorded over a 6&#160;h duration using calibrated collection containers or a graduated cylinder. Oil was collected in 100 mL increments, and the total recovered oil volume was documented. Permeate samples were obtained at regular 30&#160;min intervals and examined to determine the remaining oil concentration in the water phase using UV&#8211;visible spectroscopy. The absorbance of the materials was characterized at a wavelength of 600&#160;nm, and the oil concentration was measured by calibration curve. The separation efficiency of the membrane was established on the percentage of oil extracted from the emulsion, calculated as following: separation efficiency = (initial oil content - final oil content) / initial oil content &#215; 100%, where initial oil content represents the total volume of oil introduced into the emulsion, and final oil content represents the total volume of oil recovered from the permeate.

The improved oil removal efficiency of the composite membrane can be attributed to various factors, including surface modifications and the incorporation of GO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, and SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. These improvements are likely to improve the affinity of the membrane for oil droplets, thereby enhancing their adsorption and subsequent removal from the water stream. In addition, the asymmetric structure of the membrane, as suggested by morphological analysis, may facilitate more efficient oil/water separation by acting as a barrier that restricts the passage of oil droplets while allowing the flow of water molecules. Furthermore, the lack of specific information regarding experimental conditions, such as cross-flow velocity, temperature, and oil-in-water emulsion concentration, needs to be addressed in future discussions or publications.

The clear decrease in residual oil concentration indicates successful membrane rejection of oil, resulting in lower oil levels in the permeate water. Initially, the permeate water shows a high residual oil concentration of 1000 ppm. However, as the filtration process progresses, this concentration drops significantly. After 60&#160;min, it drops to 500 ppm, indicating that a significant amount of oil has been removed. With extended filtration time, the residual oil concentration continues to decline rapidly. By the 360-min mark, it drops to less than 1 ppm, confirming the membrane&#8217;s robust ability to continue removing oil without reaching saturation. Achieving a concentration of less than 1 ppm after 360&#160;min is of particular importance, as it is in line with regulatory discharge limits for oils and greases, which are typically set at around 10 ppm. Thus, the treated water complies with environmental standards, demonstrating the membrane&#8217;s efficiency in generating high-quality effluent suitable for discharge or further treatment.

</p><p id="Par39">The study investigating the effect of GO/TiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> (GTS) nanofiller incorporation on key membrane performance metrics provides crucial insights into the relationship between nanofiller concentration and oil rejection efficiencyat different nanofiller loadings (0.5, 0.1 and 2.0 wt%). The data presented, along with the visual representation in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, indicate a clear trend of enhanced oil rejection efficiency with increasing nanofiller loading. At 0.5 wt% loading, the membrane achieves an oil rejection efficiency of 92%. This efficiency increases to 95% with increasing to 1 wt% loading. Notably, at the maximum loading of 2 wt%, the membrane shows a significant improvement in oil rejection efficiency, reaching 99%. The increase in oil rejection efficiency associated with higher concentrations of GTS nanofillers can be explained by several mechanisms. Primarily, the incorporation of these nanoparticles increases the surface area of &#8203;&#8203;the membrane, thereby providing additional active sites for interaction with oil droplets. Furthermore, the addition of nanoparticles enhances the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface, enhancing wetting and interaction with water molecules, facilitating the repulsion of oil droplets. In addition, the functional groups present on the nanoparticles may engage in chemical interactions with the oil molecules, further contributing to the enhanced oil rejection efficiency. These results emphasize the critical influence of GTS nanoparticle loading on the separation capabilities of the composite membrane. The remarkable improvement in oil rejection efficiency with increasing nanofiller content highlights the potential of nanocomposite membranes for efficient oil/water separation applications. Continued research and improvement in nanoparticle loading and membrane fabrication techniques can pave the way for the development of advanced membranes with superior performance and broader applicability in various industrial and environmental contexts.</p><p id="Par40">

</p><p id="Par41">The results shown in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> provide important insights into how varying GTS nanoparticle loadings affect the performance of the composite membrane compared to pristine PVDF, especially in terms of pure water flux and antifouling properties. As shown in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, the pure water flux of the membrane shows a decreasing trend with increasing nanofiller concentration. At 0.5 wt% loading, the membrane achieves a pure water flux of 250&#160;L/m<sup>2</sup> h, which decreases to 245&#160;L/m<sup>2</sup> h at 1 wt% loading. It is worth noting that at the maximum loading of 2 wt%, there is a significant decrease in flux, which decreases to 220&#160;L/m<sup>2</sup> h compared to pristine membrane shows a pure water flux of 265&#160;L/m<sup>2</sup> h. This decrease in pure water flux with higher nanofiller concentrations suggests that the increased blockage of the membrane pores, caused by a higher density of nanoparticles, leads to a decrease in permeability. In addition, the antifouling performance of the membrane, as shown by the flux decrease ratio, follows a similar pattern of deterioration with increasing nanofiller loadings. The flux drop ratio, which measures the decrease in flux over time during continuous operation and serves as an indicator of membrane fouling, shows that at 0.5% loading, the membrane has a flux drop ratio of 10%, reflecting moderate fouling resistance. However, as the loadings increase to 1% and 2%, the flux drop ratios increase to 8% and 15%, respectivelycompared to pristine membrane has a flux drop ratio of 26%. This trend indicates that the anti-fouling ability of the membrane deteriorates with higher nanofiller concentrations, likely due to increased pore clogging by the nanoparticles. An optimum loading of 1% GTS nanoparticles was determined for subsequent investigations based on the observations made. This specific loading achieves a favorable balance between satisfactory pure water flux and fouling resistance capabilities, thus delivering efficient performance while minimizing the detrimental effects of pore clogging on membrane permeability. Choosing this optimum loading ensures that the composite membrane retains its distinctive properties and performance features, thereby improving its applicability in practical scenarios involving oil/water separation processes.</p><p id="Par42">

</p><p id="Par43">Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> reveals the long-term evaluation of oil rejection efficiency and water flux over 100&#160;h of continuous filtration for both pristine PVDF and composite PGTS membranes, provides important insights into its reliability and durability for practical applications. The composite membrane maintains stable flux and high oil rejection (&gt;&#8201;95%) throughout the test period, while the pristine PVDF membrane exhibits a noticeable decline in performance.</p><p id="Par44">Notably, a slight flux increase was observed after 60&#160;h of continuous operation in the composite membrane. This anomaly may arise from partial leaching of unbound TiO&#8322;/SiO&#8322; nanoparticles, which could enlarge membrane pores and enhance hydrophilicity temporarily. Future iterations will employ covalent functionalization (e.g., APTES crosslinking) to improve nanoparticle retention), improving water permeability at the cost of long-term stability. Specifically, Leached nanoparticles may enlarge membrane pores, reducing hydraulic resistance (supported by SEM observations of pore widening in analogous systems). Residual hydroxyl groups from partial leaching could enhance surface hydrophilicity temporarily.</p><p id="Par45">Although the flux remained stable afterward, this warrants further investigation. A detailed nanoparticle leaching or stability analysis should be conducted in future studies to confirm membrane integrity and long-term performance.The sustained oil rejection performance confirms the membrane&#8217;s stability and reliability in separation capabilities, indicating minimal degradation or loss of function over time. Furthermore, the flux of the composite membrane remained stable at approximately 230&#160;L/m<sup>2</sup>/h throughout the test period. This consistent flux indicates that the membrane maintained a constant rate of water flow through its pores without significant fouling or clogging. The flow stability is particularly noteworthy, as it indicates minimal fouling or performance degradation, further enhancing the membrane&#8217;s long-term operational stability. The combined evidence of consistent oil rejection efficiency and stable flow throughout the 100-h test period confirms the robustness and durability of the composite membrane for extended use in oil/water separation applications.The minimal fouling or performance degradation observed during this long-term evaluation highlights the membrane&#8217;s robustness and suitability for continuous operation in various industrial and environmental contexts. These results provide valuable insights into the long-term performance characteristics of the composite membrane, instilling confidence in its practical applicability and potential to address relevant challenges.This revision contextualizes the observed behavior within broader nanocomposite membrane literature while outlining concrete steps to address stability in future work.While the PGTS membrane demonstrates exceptional fouling resistance, long-term nanoparticle retention requires further optimization. Surface covalent grafting of nanoparticles (e.g., via APTES silanization) could mitigate leaching, as explored in recent studies.</p><p id="Par46">

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par53">This research focused on the creation of an innovative composite membrane based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which was enhanced with doped graphene oxide, titania and silica to improve the separation of oil-in-water emulsions. The strategy involved incorporating hydrophilic and photocatalytic TiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles into graphene oxide nanosheets to enhance the surface area, increase water absorption capacity and facilitate the degradation of oil contaminants upon exposure to light. Morphological and surface chemical analyses conducted by scanning electron microscopy, XRD, FT-IR and contact angle evaluations indicated a uniform distribution of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix, along with a significant improvement in water absorption capacity after surface modification. Performance tests conducted under continuous flow filtration revealed that the improved composite membrane achieved over 99% oil rejection while maintaining stable flow, outperforming both pure PVDF and commercially available membranes. The synergistic effect of the inherently stable PVDF polymer matrix combined with the functional nanofillers enhanced the emulsion separation efficiency, along with improved permeability rates and fouling resistance. Notably, the membrane exhibited exceptional separation capabilities even after 100&#160;h of continuous operation, confirming its reliability and anti-fouling properties during extended use. Overall, this study successfully produced a high-performance nanocomposite membrane through a straightforward fabrication method, showing great potential for treating oily industrial and domestic wastewater. The scalability of the membrane synthesis process may facilitate its adoption in various separation applications. Future investigations could focus on evaluating the long-term durability across multiple operating cycles and examining the effects of variables such as temperature, pH, and salinity on the separation efficiency. Owing to their high selectivity, productivity, and fouling resistance, these multifunctional nanocomposite membranes offer a sustainable and effective approach to address the global issue of oily water treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors extend their appreciation to the deanship of Scientific Research at King Khaled University for funding this work through a large research project under grant number RGP 2/200/46.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>M.F.M., N.B., A.A.R., A.H.R., N.F.G., E.M.E., H.S.A. and A.E. contributed to the rewriting and discussion of the results.
