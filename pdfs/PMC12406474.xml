Birth control, also known as contraception, is the deliberate prevention of conception or pregnancy by using different methods or devices. The concept of birth control dates back to ancient times, although safe and effective methods were not widely available until the twentieth century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Throughout history, various traditional contraceptive methods, such as herbal remedies, barrier methods, and withdrawal, have been employed. While these age-old approaches provided some control over fertility compared to no intervention at all, their reliability and effectiveness often paled in comparison to the advancements of modern contraceptive options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Advances in medical science and technology have led to modern contraceptive methods, offering greater effectiveness and convenience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, their efficacy and efficiency vary, with methods differing in pregnancy prevention, ease of use, and user convenience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) being the most reliable, offering over 99% effectiveness. Implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) provide long-term protection with minimal user effort, making them ideal for those seeking highly effective and low-maintenance options. With regular usage, short-acting contraceptives (SACs), such as injectable, pills, patches, and vaginal rings, are 91&#8211;94% effective; nevertheless, their efficacy must be maintained through persistent adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Women possess the fundamental right to choose among contraception options, which is an essential aspect of their reproductive autonomy. The ability to freely and responsibly determine the number, spacing, and timing of pregnancy is a vital component of reproductive autonomy and gender equality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The number of women seeking family planning services increased from 900&#160;million to over 1.1&#160;billion between 2000 and 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Concurrently, the use of modern contraceptive methods by women has grown from 663&#160;million to 851&#160;million. Currently, approximately 65% of the global population uses contraception, with about 58.7% of married or women in a union relying on modern methods. Projections suggest that an additional 70&#160;million women will adopt modern contraception by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These figures underscore the growing global demand for family planning services and the critical need to ensure broad access to modern contraceptive options. However, contraceptive choices vary across regions, with distinct method dominance observed worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In Ethiopia, injectable alone account for nearly half of all contraceptive use, demonstrating their widespread adoption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ethiopian Ministry of Health (EMoH) encourage the use of LARCs due to their effectiveness, convenience, and cost benefits, particularly in resource-limited settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. LARCs offer significant advantages over SACs through their high effectiveness, reduced need for frequent healthcare visits, and rapid return of fertility after device removal. Economically, LARCs are more cost-effective in the long run by lowering healthcare costs and reducing demand for frequent contraceptive resupply, contributing to efficient resource allocation at the national level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Despite these compelling advantages and recommendations, evidence consistently indicates that short-acting contraceptives, particularly injectable, remain the most commonly used methods in Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This persistent disparity underscores a critical gap in understanding how women navigate and select specific modern contraceptive options in real-world settings.</p><p id="Par10">This modified grounded theory (MGT) study in Wolaita, Southern Ethiopia, aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing married women&#8217;s contraceptive method selection among available modern options. The findings will inform targeted interventions, policies, and strategies that promote informed and empowered contraceptive choice. Aligned with national and international reproductive health objectives, this research will provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and stakeholders involved in family planning programs, ultimately contributing to the increased uptake of recommended LARC methods and improved reproductive health outcomes in the region.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par11">For this study, a modified grounded theory approach was selected to facilitate data collecting and analysis easier. This method goes beyond straightforward explanation to produce fresh theoretical understandings while integrating preexisting theories at the interpretation stage to give the findings a more comprehensive context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The modified grounded theory approach allowed for the development of substantive theories emerging directly from the data, enabling a deeper understanding of the factors shaping married women&#8217;s modern contraceptive method selection.</p><p id="Par12">The study was conducted in the Boloso Sore district, located in the Wolaita Zone, South Ethiopia, in 2019. Boloso Sore compares of 32 kebele, the lowest administrative units. The district has an estimated population of over 279,218, with an annual estimated number of 13,940 contraceptive users. Healthcare services, including contraceptive provision, are available through one private general hospital, eight health centers, and 32 health posts, providing both curative and preventive healthcare support.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study participants and sampling</title><p id="Par13">The selection of participants in this study involved purposive and theoretical sampling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In the initial phase, purposive sampling was used to recruit married women using modern contraceptive methods. These participants were selected based on their ability to provide foundational insights directly relevant to the research question considering age, parity, and contraceptive method type. Theoretical sampling was used in subsequent phases to address emerging gaps and refine underdeveloped aspects of the identified categories. Health professionals and health extension worker were included to provide insights into sociocultural and healthcare system influences on selection process, filling gaps identified in earlier phases and further refining the emerging category.</p><p id="Par14">The Participants were recruited from both the rural population and healthcare facilities in the Boloso Sore district of Wolaita Zone. The study specifically focused on currently married women aged 18 years or older who were using modern contraceptive methods. The focus was intentional, as this group is more likely to be actively engaged in family planning decisions and represents a key demographic for contraceptive use in the study context. Participant recruitment was conducted by the principal investigator in collaboration with health extension workers and healthcare providers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection procedure</title><p id="Par15">The data for this study were collected through focus group discussions (FGDs) and individual interviews using structured guides tailored to each method. Separate guides were developed for FGDs and individual interviews, ensuring that questions were appropriate for group discussions and individual responses. These guides were specifically developed for this study, informed by existing literature and expert consultation. Initially developed in English, and translated into the local language &#8220;wolayttato Dona&#8221; to ensure clarity and cultural relevance.</p><p id="Par16">The data collection process spanned three study phases. In the first phase, 35 married women using modern contraception were purposively and theoretically selected to participate in four FGDs, each consisting of 8&#8211;10 participants. Data collection began by selecting two groups of contraceptive users one from the general population and the other from Women&#8217;s Health Development Army leaders, whose characteristics were relevant to the study. Additional participants were recruited theoretically based on insights gathered from earlier interviews and its analysis, leading to the formation of two more groups for the FGDs. The discussions took place in a meeting area, such as under a tree, at the health post and lasted on average for 90&#160;min. The FGDs aimed to explore women&#8217;s shared perspectives and experiences regarding their method selection among the available modern contraceptive options.</p><p id="Par17">In the second phase, eight participants were theoretically recruited for individual interviews based on gap in emerging themes from the FGDs. These participants included healthcare professionals and Health extension worker, who provided additional insights into the social, structural, and healthcare-related factors influencing contraceptive choices. Additionally, this phase included contraceptive users who had previously taken part in the FGDs. They were recruited in order to provide more firsthand information about their unique experiences, and difficulties with using specific contraceptives.</p><p id="Par18">Theoretical sampling ensured that these interviews filled gaps in the developing categories, thereby deepening the understanding of women&#8217;s modern contraceptive method selection. The interviews were conducted at health facilities or participants&#8217; residences, depending on their convenience, and lasted an average of 35&#160;min.</p><p id="Par19">In the final phase of data collection, one FGD was conducted with participants from both the first and second phases, including contraceptive user, healthcare professionals and health extension workers. By engaging key participants in discussions, this stage ensured the developed theoretical model accurately captured the real-world factors influencing married women&#8217;s modern contraceptive method selection.</p><p id="Par20">The principal investigator facilitated all the focus groups and interviews, maintaining objectivity by having no prior connections to the research participants and not being a member of the contraceptive provider or counseling team. The moderator took deliberate steps to create an inclusive and balanced discussion environment among the participants. They employed techniques to ensure that all voices were heard and encouraged open dialogue, fostering a sense of equality among participants. During the data collection process, both the focus groups and interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Field notes were also taken to capture contextual content, including participants&#8217; feelings and nonverbal communication. The verbatim transcripts were independently compared with the audio recordings by the primary investigator and research advisor to ensure accuracy before proceeding to further analysis. The research advisor also reviewed the interviewer&#8217;s performance on the interview questions and adherence to the protocol for each transcript, enhancing the fidelity of each focus group and interview session.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par21">
The principal investigator, along with experienced research advisers who possess significant expertise in qualitative methods, conducted the data analysis for this study. The analysis followed a three-stage approach.</p><p id="Par22">During the first stage, we conducted a careful line-by-line examination of the transcripts in open coding. We assigned individual codes to specific segments of the text and utilized the constant comparative technique to compare and contrast subsequent codes. After analyzing one to two transcripts, the research advisers convened to discuss the codes. They reviewed each transcript again and reached a consensus on identifying instances that were not directly related to the selection process. This consensus-building process resulted in a set of agreed-upon coded transcripts for each focus group and interview. Furthermore, the advisers independently audited the coding process to ensure rigor.</p><p id="Par23">The second stage, known as axial coding, started after the completion of stage 1 analysis of the focus group data during a face-to-face meeting between the principal investigator and advisers. Axial coding involved comparing codes with other data, merging and condensing codes, and grouping codes into categories and themes. The resulting coding schema was used and modified in subsequent interviews.</p><p id="Par24">In the third stage, selective coding focused on integrating and refining categories and themes once the model and core variable had been identified. Coding was delimited to categories relevant to the core variable. The finalization of the model occurred during a subsequent meeting and was then vetted through a focus group comprising study participants and key stakeholders. This study adhered to the 32 Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research, ensuring methodological transparency and thoroughness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Trustworthiness of the study</title><p id="Par25">To ensure the trustworthiness of the study findings, several measures were implemented throughout the research process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. To enhance credibility, multiple data collection methods were employed, including FGDs and interviews, which allowed for triangulation of data from different sources. The use of purposive and theoretical sampling helped in selecting diverse participants, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the research topic.</p><p id="Par26">Detailed descriptions of the study setting, participants, and data collection methods were provided to facilitate the transferability of the findings to similar contexts. This allows readers to assess the applicability of the results to other settings or populations. To establish dependability, an established grounded theory design was utilized, which involves a systematic and rigorous approach to data collection and analysis. The principal investigator conducted all the focus groups and interviews to maintain consistency and reduce potential bias. Additionally, verbatim transcription of audio recordings and independent comparisons between transcripts and recordings by the primary investigator and research advisor ensured accurate representation of participants&#8217; responses. To enhance confirmability, an audit trail of the research process was maintained. This included keeping field notes to document contextual content, such as participants&#8217; feelings and nonverbal communication. The research advisor reviewed the interviewer&#8217;s performance and adherence to the interview protocol, further ensuring the fidelity of each session. The principal investigator and research advisor engaged in regular discussions and reflections on their biases and assumptions throughout the research process. This reflexivity helped in acknowledging and minimizing potential researcher biases and increasing the objectivity of the study.</p><p id="Par27">By implementing these strategies, this study aimed to enhance the trustworthiness of the findings and provide a robust foundation for generating new theoretical insights into married women&#8217;s modern contraceptive method selection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Description of the study participants</title><p id="Par28">A total of 43 individuals participated in this study; 35 were modern contraception users, and eight were health workers with experience in counseling and providing contraception at health facilities.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Category 1: Desire for an effective method</title><p id="Par33">
The study participants consistently expressed a strong desire for an effective contraceptive method, compelling them to seek and adopt a suitable option among modern contraceptives. The need to prevent unplanned pregnancies and regulate fertility drove women to choose methods that minimize the risk of conception. Recognizing the potential consequences of unintended pregnancies, participants were motivated to explore available options. They emphasized selecting a reliable and trustworthy method to effectively achieve their reproductive goals and ensure peace of mind in their family planning.</p><p id="Par34">Participants indicated that recognizing the potential for unplanned pregnancies motivated them to adopt among modern contraception. One participant shared:</p><p id="Par35">
<disp-quote><p id="Par36"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;&#8230;. I have never been pregnant until my child stops breastfeeding</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> so I am not familiar with modern methods of family planning. However</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I had a powerful urge to space my pregnancies over an expanded period</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> so I attended the health center and began taking Depo.&#8221;</italic> (A 37-year-old married woman).</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par37">Furthermore, Women desire contraceptive methods that can be used consciously regulate when and how often pregnancies occur, aligning with an individual&#8217;s or couple&#8217;s desired reproductive plans. The focus is on having control over fertility and making informed decisions about when to conceive or avoid conception based on personal circumstances, such as career goals, family planning, or health considerations.</p><p id="Par38">
<disp-quote><p id="Par39"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;I do not want to have a pregnancy in the coming two years. I should focus on completing my education and attending my classes. Therefore</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I decided to take a contraceptive from the health center.&#8220;(A 24-year-old married woman)</italic>.</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par40">This highlights that the desire for longer birth spacing and effectively regulating fertility drives women to seek effective and reliable method among the modern options.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Category 2: Fears and preferences related to method administration and side effects</title><p id="Par41">When women decide to use a modern contraceptive method, they commonly experience concerns or worries associated with that specific method. These concerns come from &#8220;Fear of undesirable consequences&#8221; and considerations of the &#8220;method&#8217;s administration&#8221;. These factors play pivotal roles in explaining why married women actively seek contraceptive methods that meet their needs and expectations. Preconceived information, personal experiences, and criticism from significant others often drive these underlying concerns and worries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Subcategory: Fear of undesirable consequences</title><p id="Par42">The study participants revealed feelings of fear and uncertainty regarding the potential side effects associated with the contraceptive method they intended to use. This fear may have arisen from the information they received about the method, either from others or from their own past experiences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Preconceived information</title><p id="Par43">Existing information on contraceptive methods significantly influences the method selection process. This information, perceived as either positive or negative, shapes married women&#8217;s choices among available modern options. According to participants, many married women believe using certain contraceptives before giving birth can lead to infertility. One participant shared her experience during a focus group discussion, stating,</p><p id="Par44">
<disp-quote><p id="Par45"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;I had used a contraceptive that is inserted into the arm&#8230; before giving birth&#8230; at that time</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> many people criticized me for using such a method before having children&#8230; they told me that it could cause infertility. Therefore</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> after seven months</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I removed it and switched to use Depo&#8221;. (A 24-year-old married woman)</italic></p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par46">Participants in the study also disclosed that their primary source of first-hand information regarding contraceptive methods was their relatives or family members. However, a significant portion of the information obtained from these sources tended to be negative, particularly regarding certain contraceptive methods. This negative information had a detrimental impact on women&#8217;s willingness to consider and use specific methods. One participant shared her experience during a focus group discussion, stating,</p><p id="Par47">
<disp-quote><p id="Par48"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;In my experience</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> when I discussed contraceptive methods with my relatives or family members</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> most of the information I received was negative. It created doubts and concerns in my mind</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> making me hesitant to choose those methods.&#8221; (A 25-year-old married woman)</italic>.</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par49">Another participant highlighted the prevalence of unsubstantiated rumors, saying,</p><p id="Par50">
<disp-quote><p id="Par51"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;There have been so many unsubstantiated rumors&#8230; When I chose the three-year contraceptive method</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> many women told me that it would cause harm. They mentioned heavier menstrual bleeding and the need for additional milk at home. However</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I have not experienced any of these issues since using it&#8221;. (A 38-year-old married woman)</italic></p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par52">Therefore, the choice of contraceptive method often relies on information obtained from others rather than being based on the best available options. One participant provided an explanation, stating,</p><p id="Par53">
<disp-quote><p id="Par54"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;Before starting a modern contraceptive method</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I was informed that the three-year alternative (Implanon) could infiltrate deep into the bones and cause harm. Because of this</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I decided against using the three-year alternative&#8221;. (A 29-year-old married woman).</italic></p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par55">These findings revealed that information received from relatives or family members played a crucial role in shaping women&#8217;s perceptions and their <bold>method selection</bold>. The predominantly negative nature of this information significantly influenced participants&#8217; willingness to consider and use certain contraceptive options.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Previous personal experience</title><p id="Par56">According to the study participants, some contraceptive users choose to switch to a different method after using a particular method for a period of time. The emergence of side effects associated with the contraceptive method often drives this decision. These side effects can be attributed to either the effects of the drug itself or errors in the administration procedure. Participants shared their experiences as follows:</p><p id="Par57">
<disp-quote><p id="Par58"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;&#8230;during that time</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I encountered two issues with the method I was using. First</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I experienced menstrual problems that lasted for a week and had irregular cycle. Second</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I had a problem with the needle getting lost inside my body. This compelled me to remove it immediately</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> and I switched to Depo&#8221;. (A 24-year-old married woman)</italic></p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par59">In such cases, the presence of undesirable side effects prompted the women to discontinue their use of the initial method and seek an alternative that better suited their needs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Subcategory: Ways a drug will be administered</title><p id="Par60">The manner in which a contraceptive method is administered significantly influences its selection among available modern options. The study participants expressed fear and concerns specifically related to the administration procedures of certain contraceptive methods. This fear primarily revolves around the perception of these procedures as uncommon or invasive within the community. The participants view them as significant procedures, such as operations, and as apprehensive toward them. A married woman from a focus group discussion described this concern:</p><p id="Par61">
<disp-quote><p id="Par62"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;Because many women in my community think that implants and IUCDs require surgery</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> they are terrified of them. They are concerned about the discomfort and potential side effects. Some individuals ask</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> &#8220;What if it gets inside my body?&#8221; or &#8220;What if it damages me in the long run?&#8221; Because we don&#8217;t see many individuals utilizing them</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> the worry persists even after health professionals explain. Because they seem simpler and safer to us</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> we choose injections or pills.&#8221;</italic> (A 30-year-old married woman).</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par63">Another participant in a FGD supported this sentiment by sharing her personal, disquieting experience with the IUCD:</p><p id="Par64">
<disp-quote><p id="Par65"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;Once</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> a healthcare provider took me and another woman to the health center to have the Loop (IUCD) inserted. However</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> upon entering the room</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I witnessed nurses inserting the loop for other women</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> which frightened me. The way they were performing the procedure and the presence of multiple nurses around confused me. As a result</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I decided not to proceed with the IUCD. Instead</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I opted for a three-year method.&#8221;</italic> (A 38-year-old married woman).</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par66">These accounts underscore how the perceived complexity or unusualness of administration procedures can profoundly impact the selection of a specific contraceptive method, even in the face of evidence suggesting the method&#8217;s safety and effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Category: Actions taken</title><p id="Par67">When married women find themselves in situations that demand birth spacing or limit their births and when they experience concerns and confusion, they take proactive steps to address their uncertainties. Two significant actions that married women commonly take in such circumstances are &#8220;consulting others&#8221; and &#8220;observing others&#8217; experiences.&#8221;</p><p id="Par68">Both of these actions reflect the proactive approach taken by married women to address their concerns and confusion surrounding method selection among modern contraceptive options. By seeking advice and learning from the experiences of others, women strive to make well-grounded method selections that mitigate their uncertainties and ultimately support their reproductive health goals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Subcategory: Consulting others</title><p id="Par69">The action of &#8220;consulting others&#8221; involves seeking guidance and advice from trusted individuals, such as family members, friends, or healthcare providers, when married women face confusion or concern about contraceptive options. By engaging in discussions and seeking input from these sources, married women clarify their doubts, gather information, and gain different perspectives, aiding their contraceptive method selection.</p><p id="Par70">For instance, some participants in the study shared their experiences of consulting with their relatives or healthcare workers when they felt uncertain about contraceptive options. Women sought guidance on various aspects, including potential harm or side effects associated with contraceptive methods. One participant mentioned their fear of potential harm caused by the contraceptive drug and inquired about what to do in case of any adverse effects. They also mentioned hearing rumors about harm related to contraceptive methods, which further fueled their concerns. As a result, they sought advice from healthcare extension workers to address their concerns and gain clarification.</p><p id="Par71">
<disp-quote><p id="Par72"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;I expressed my fear of being harmed by the drug to the health workers. Additionally</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> using a contraceptive causes me stress due to having a lot of work to do.

</p><p id="Par73">These findings illustrate how married women actively seek information and support from reliable sources to alleviate their fears and make informed contraceptive method selections. Consulting others allows them to access knowledge, receive reassurance, and address specific concerns, enabling them to choose contraceptive options that align with their individual needs and preferences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Subcategory: Observe others&#8217; experiences</title><p id="Par74">In addition to consulting others, married women often engage in the practice of &#8220;observing others&#8217; experiences&#8221; with regard to selecting a method among modern contraceptive options. This involves paying attention to the experiences of other women who have already used or are currently using contraceptive methods. By actively observing and learning from these experiences, married women gain valuable insights into the effectiveness, potential side effects, and overall satisfaction associated with different contraceptive options.</p><p id="Par75">
<disp-quote><p id="Par76"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;Ok</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">&#8230; I started by using Depo&#8230; there is a condition of mothers that they removed Implanon by an operation because it gets too deep in the arm that they may cost more than 400 Ethiopian birrs</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> which is difficult. Therefore</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I have a fear of using other methods&#8230; and I am using DEPO&#8221;.</italic> (A 28-year-old married woman) By witnessing the experiences of other women, married women can gather information that goes beyond theoretical or perceived information knowledge. They learn about the practical aspects of using specific contraceptive methods, including convenience, effectiveness, and potential challenges or drawbacks. This information influences their method selection to align with their specific needs and preferences.</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par77">
One participant mentioned how she received information about birth control from healthcare workers in her community. However, her motivation to use contraception came from observing other mothers who were already using contraceptives. By seeing these women successfully using contraception, she felt encouraged to explore her own options. This firsthand observation played a significant role in her decision-making process, leading her to use Depo-Provera as her chosen contraceptive method.</p><p id="Par78">
<disp-quote><p id="Par79"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;I got information about birth control when the health workers taught in our kebele. In addition</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I was motivated to use it by looking at mothers who were using contraceptives in our surroundings. First</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I started with Depo&#8230;&#8221;</italic> (A 28-year-old married woman).</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par80">Observing others&#8217; experiences allows married women to gather insights from real-life examples and make method selections based on the practical implications of using a particular contraceptive. It provides them with a sense of reassurance and confidence in their choice, as they can learn from the experiences of those who have already navigated the contraceptive landscape.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Category: Intervening conditions</title><p id="Par81">In the context of married women&#8217;s modern contraceptive method selection, &#8216;intervening conditions&#8217; refer to various external factors or circumstances that influence their method selection. These conditions also can impact actions, responses, and motivations related to individuals&#8217; contraceptive preferences and needs.</p><p id="Par82">Intervening conditions can either facilitate or hinder the selection of a specific contraceptive option among the available options. They can significantly impact the actions and reactions of married women in response to their concerns and influence their motivation and selection process. These conditions include significant others&#8217; influence, health service providers&#8217; influence, and the unavailability of preferred options.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Subcategory: Significant others influence</title><p id="Par83">Significant others, including spouses, friends, family members, and healthcare providers, significantly impact women&#8217;s contraceptive method selection. They can offer valuable support and guidance, helping women navigate their choices and considerations. However, participants also reported that these significant others can act as potential obstacles or sources of resistance. According to the participants&#8217; accounts, there were situations where spouses or family members expressed disapproval of modern contraception or specific types of contraceptives. Consequently, some married women opt for contraceptive methods that are convenient to use discreetly, allowing them to keep their usage hidden from their husbands or other family members.</p><p id="Par84">
<disp-quote><p id="Par85"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;In our family</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> my mother-in-law does not support the use of long-term contraceptive methods</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> and even my husband disagrees with using an IUCD&#8230; For example</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> my husband is a health worker (nurse)</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> but he does not allow me to use an IUCD.

(A 30-year-old married woman).</italic></p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par86">These instances highlight the challenges certain married women encounter when making their modern contraceptive method selection. They may face resistance from family members, including their husbands, which can impact their choice of contraceptive method from the modern options available to them. In such situations, they often prefer to use a convenient method and easy to use secretly, allowing them to maintain privacy and discretion.</p><p id="Par87">
Healthcare providers play a critical role by providing information, counseling, and expertise to help women navigate contraceptive options. The information, guidance, and support provided by health service providers strongly influence the confidence and willingness of married women to use a particular contraceptive method.</p><p id="Par88">The influence of health service providers can actively shape participants&#8217; attitudes toward specific contraceptives. In a FGD, a participant mentioned that she initially used Depo-Provera but was influenced by the consultation and efforts made by health extension workers to switch to the three-year method (Implanon). She expressed satisfaction with both methods and emphasized that they had no negative effects on her. She stated the following:</p><p id="Par89">
<disp-quote><p id="Par90"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;Therefore</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I started using Depo&#8230;. now I am using the three-year method (Implanon) after giving birth to my last baby.

Now I am happy that both methods have no harm to me.&#8221;</italic> (A 25-year-old married woman).</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par91">The accounts shared by participants also indicate that some married women changed their contraceptive choice after consulting contraceptive service providers. During these consultations, patients received accurate and factual information about different contraceptive options, influencing their method selection. One of the participants mentioned that during her visit for immunization, a health extension worker advised her about the safety and effectiveness of the three-year method (Implanon) for preventing pregnancy. Initially, she had concerns about using it, but the health worker&#8217;s motivation and assurance that any problems would be promptly addressed convinced her to try Implanon. As a result, she agreed to use it and expressed her current satisfaction with the method. This was stated in her actual work as follows:</p><p id="Par92">
<disp-quote><p id="Par93"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;Yes&#8230; because the health extension worker advised me when I went for immunization&#8230; She told me that the three-year method (Implanon) is safe and effective in preventing pregnancy&#8230; but at that time</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I had feared using it&#8230; but she was motivated&#8230; and after she assured me that she would remove it as soon as possible if it has any problem&#8230; then I agreed and took (three-year method) Implanon&#8230; now I am using it.&#8221;</italic> (A 28-year-old married woman).</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par94">These findings demonstrate the significant impact of health service providers on married women&#8217;s modern contraceptive method selection. Their influence can help dispel fears, provide accurate information, and address concerns, ultimately shaping the method selection process. This highlights the importance of effective communication and counseling from healthcare professionals in guiding married women toward suitable contraceptive options that meet their needs and preferences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Subcategory: Unavailability of the preferred drug</title><p id="Par95">In the context of intervening conditions, one significant factor is the unavailability of a preferred contraceptive method by individual women, which exerts pressure on the selection of a contraceptive method by married women. This context impacts their contraceptive choices and leads them to consider alternative options. During a focus group discussion, participants shared their experiences to illustrate the influence of the unavailability of a preferred method on their contraceptive use. One of the FGD participants stated that.</p><p id="Par96">
<disp-quote><p id="Par97"><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;&#8230;after three weeks</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> I have gone to the hospital to retake DEPO&#8230;but at the time Depo is not available</italic>,<italic toggle="yes"> due to this I took a three-year birth controlling method (Implanon)&#8230;&#8221;</italic> (A 38-year-old married woman).</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par98">In this particular case, the participant clearly preferred Depo-Provera, but due to its unavailability, she had to adapt and select an alternative method to meet her contraceptive needs. This highlights how the unavailability of a preferred contraceptive drug can influence married women&#8217;s contraceptive choices. When their preferred option is not accessible or is out of stock, they may be compelled to select an alternative method that is available at that moment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par99">Our findings reveal that the desire for an effective method significantly influences women&#8217;s selection of modern contraceptive options. This desire acts as a powerful driver throughout the overarching process of &#8220;finding an appropriate method for mentality,&#8221; which emerged as the core category of this study. As the previous studies have shown, the decision to use modern contraceptives is determined perusing the effective method to fulfill their reproductive goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Moreover, the findings underscore that women&#8217;s perceptions of contraceptive effectiveness play a critical role in their method selection process. Many women prioritize effectiveness when considering contraceptive methods, with a significant majority indicating it as a crucial factor in their choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Specifically, this desire for effective methods among <italic toggle="yes">married women</italic> stems from their awareness of the risks associated with unplanned pregnancies and a conscious desire to limit and plan their family size. As previous studies have shown, recognizing the importance of spacing and planning pregnancies for optimal health outcomes drives motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This indicates that providing women with more knowledge about the efficacy of various methods can empower them to make better method selections, potentially increasing the use of effective contraceptives and improving reproductive outcomes.</p><p id="Par100">The &#8216;desire for an effective method&#8217; finds strong resonance with established behavioral theories, such as the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Specifically, according to the HBM, women&#8217;s motivation to use contraception is driven by their perceived susceptibility to and severity of unplanned pregnancies, which compels them to seek methods perceived as highly efficacious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Similarly, the TPB suggests that motivation to use a specific contraceptive method is influenced by women&#8217;s perception of that method&#8217;s effectiveness, alongside perceived societal pressure, and their sense of control over accessing and using contraception. Interestingly, some married women discreetly use contraception without their spouses&#8217; knowledge, indicating a prioritization of their health concerns and a choice to use contraception secretly.</p><p id="Par101">Married women prioritize selecting reliable and trustworthy contraceptive methods to achieve their reproductive goals. The findings of this study revealed concerns about undesirable consequences, and misinformation significantly influence contraceptive choices. Fear of side effects, often shaped by misinformation and personal experiences, contributes to hesitancy, particularly toward long-acting methods. LARCs, such as IUCDs and implants, are frequently perceived as invasive or surgical procedures, leading to reluctance among many married women. This is demonstrated by current contraceptive use pattern; the overall prevalence of modern contraceptive use among married women aged 18 and above is approximately 38.7%. However, there is a significant disparity between the use of SACs and LARCs. Injectable, a short-acting method, are the most widely used, accounting for 22.82% of contraceptive use, while LARCs, such as implants and IUCDs, account for only 9.65%. other studies show that health concerns, fear of side effects, privacy issues, and the desire for the freedom to discontinue use without involving healthcare providers are important factors associated with the low uptake of LARCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Understanding these factors is crucial to addressing barriers and improving access to effective contraceptive options.</p><p id="Par102">As the study findings indicated, underlying concerns and worries often come from preconceived information, personal experiences, and criticism from significant others. Preconceived information, which may be based on cultural beliefs or general knowledge, can shape women&#8217;s concerns about specific contraceptive methods. Personal experiences, such as previous encounters with contraception or stories shared by others, can also contribute to their fears of a specific method. In addition, criticism or negative remarks from significant others, such as partners or family members, can influence women&#8217;s method selection and generate concerns about their chosen modern options. A study in Ghana found that women forgo modern contraceptive use due to anticipated side effects and misconceptions stemming from rumors or previous method experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. These concerns, including menstrual changes and fears of infertility, highlight the need for comprehensive counseling to address misinformation and promote informed contraceptive choices.</p><p id="Par103">The study findings also revealed that when faced with situations that call for birth spacing or limiting births, married women take proactive actions to address their heir uncertainties and concerns. The study findings highlight two significant actions commonly undertaken by married women in such circumstances: &#8220;consulting others&#8221; and &#8220;observing others&#8217; experiences&#8221;. These behaviors can be understood through established social and behavioral theories.</p><p id="Par104">According to social network theory, people seek information, advice, and support from their social networks when making decisions or facing uncertainties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In the context of married women&#8217;s contraceptive method selection, consulting others can involve seeking advice and information from trusted individuals within their social network, such as friends, family members, or healthcare providers. By consulting others, women can gather different perspectives, experiences, and knowledge that can help them address their uncertainties and concerns regarding a specific modern contraceptive option. Similarly, the concept of observational learning, as outlined in social cognitive theory, suggests that individuals can acquire knowledge and attitudes by observing the experiences of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. As the finding revealed, married women in the process of selecting among modern contraceptive options, observe the outcomes of other women&#8217;s experiences with various contraceptives. This provides valuable insights into effectiveness, side effects, and overall satisfaction. This observational learning can significantly influence their method selection. However, it is essential to recognize that the reliability of information obtained through these channels may vary, as individual biological differences can lead to different responses to contraceptive methods. Thus, while consulting others and observing experiences are valuable strategies for gathering information, they may not always provide accurate or comprehensive insights into the effectiveness of specific contraceptives. The dominance of a single method may be attributed to this factor.</p><p id="Par105">The findings of this study also highlighted intervening conditions that play a crucial role in shaping participants&#8217; final method selection. These conditions encompass various external factors or circumstances that influence how women execute their choices and ultimately select a contraceptive method. In addition, these conditions significantly shape the behavior and reactions of married women as they navigate their concerns and considerations related to contraception, ultimately influencing the selection of a specific method. This condition may involve factors such as the approval and support of significant others and the availability of preferred contraceptive options. These factors determine the method used. This can be further examined considering behavioral theories and models. According to the social ecological model, multiple levels of influence, including interpersonal, community, and societal factors, shape individuals&#8217; actual behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In the context of contraceptive method selection, the identified intervening conditions align with these different levels of influence. The approval and support of significant others, such as spouses, family members, and friends, represent interpersonal factors, whereas the influence of healthcare providers can be categorized as community-level factors. The availability of preferred contraceptive options and adherence to societal norms fall under the realm of societal-level factors.</p><p id="Par106">Participants actively reported that significant others, such as spouses, partners, family members, and healthcare providers, exerted a significant influence on contraceptive method selection. Their opinions, beliefs, and preferences regarding the available modern options played a powerful role in shaping participants&#8217; method selection. The influence of significant others could either support or hinder the adoption of a specific contraceptive method. This finding was corroborated by a previous study conducted in various regions of Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Building on this, when a woman&#8217;s partner or family holds positive attitudes toward a specific method, this can actively facilitate its selection. Conversely, their disapproval or reservations about a particular method can create significant barriers and influence her motivation regarding method selection.</p><p id="Par107">Beyond direct social influence, clear and accurate communication coupled with respectful, nonjudgmental care by healthcare professionals also significantly influences clients&#8217; method selection. Furthermore, the accessibility and availability of a chosen contraceptive method profoundly affect married women&#8217;s ultimate choice. If a woman&#8217;s preferred method is not easily accessible or is unavailable in her community or healthcare setting, her options are limited. This unavailability can compel women to consider alternative methods, thus becoming a significant influencing factor in their final contraceptive method selection.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par108">
This study&#8217;s strengths lie in its modified grounded theory approach, providing an in-depth, context-specific understanding of married women&#8217;s modern contraceptive method selection. The inclusion of diverse participant groups married women, women&#8217;s health development army leaders, and healthcare providers enabled robust data triangulation, significantly enhancing trustworthiness. Further, local language data collection ensured cultural and linguistic validity. This research also offers timely insights into the persistent gap between LARC policy recommendations and women&#8217;s actual short-acting choices.</p><p id="Par109">However, the study has inherent limitations. Its exclusive focus on married women aged 18 and above excludes perspectives from unmarried women and adolescents. While offering valuable theoretical insights, the findings are context-specific to Wolaita Zone, aiming to generate theory rather than be statistically generalizable. Additionally, despite efforts for an open environment, social desirability bias may have influenced some group discussion responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par110">This modified grounded theory study offers valuable insights into the intricate process of &#8216;finding an appropriate method for mentality,&#8217; which drives married women&#8217;s selection of modern contraceptive options in Wolaita. Our findings highlight that the &#8216;desire for an effective method&#8217; is a primary motivator, stemming from the need to prevent unplanned pregnancies and effectively regulate fertility. However, this desire is navigated alongside concerns arising from misinformation and personal experiences that influence women&#8217;s perceptions of specific modern contraceptive options. Women actively address these concerns and manage their method selection process by seeking guidance from others and drawing from their experiences.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We sincerely thank all the participants, health care proffesionanls, and health extension workers for their support in this study.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BDK, ATG, and SM: Conceptualization of the study and methodology.
