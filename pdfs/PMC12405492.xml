Current safety management models for prefabricated construction primarily focus on preventing safety accidents, lacking a holistic, systematic analysis of the system&#8217;s comprehensive capability when subjected to risk disturbances. This study adopts a resilience perspective, focusing on the safety resilience of prefabricated construction engineering systems. Utilizing accident case studies and academic literature as sources, it preliminarily identifies 24 influencing factors of safety resilience based on the four types of resilience. The rationality of the indicator system is validated through confirmatory factor analysis, including structural validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Based on the screened and validated safety resilience indicator system, a Bayesian Network model for the safety resilience of prefabricated construction engineering is established. Through forward causal inference, backward diagnostic inference, and sensitivity analysis within the Bayesian Network model, critical influencing pathways and sensitive nodes are identified. Targeted countermeasures and suggestions to enhance the safety resilience of prefabricated construction engineering systems are proposed. This approach can effectively improve the system&#8217;s risk resistance capability and post-disaster rapid recovery capacity, thereby strengthening its overall safety resilience.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Prefabricated building</kwd><kwd>System security</kwd><kwd>Safety resilience</kwd><kwd>Bayesian network</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Engineering</kwd><kwd>Mathematics and computing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Scientific Research Project of Hebei Provincial Department of Education</institution></funding-source><award-id>SQ2024078</award-id><award-id>SQ2024078</award-id><award-id>SQ2024078</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Xiaogang</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zehao</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yaohua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Compared to traditional construction methods, prefabricated construction offers distinct advantages in energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, accelerated project timelines, and enhanced quality control.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Analysis of bayesian network model</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Bayesian network security resilience prior probability analysis</title><p id="Par39">In the Netica 6.08(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.norsys.com/netica.html">https://www.norsys.com/netica.html</ext-link>), edit the states of each node. For instance, the state indicating whether a safety resilience-influencing factor is active can be represented by two options: &#8220;Yes&#8221; for active and &#8220;No&#8221; for inactive. After creating all nodes, input the prior probability parameters derived from questionnaire analysis. Once data entry is complete, utilize the Netica 6.08(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.norsys.com/netica.html">https://www.norsys.com/netica.html</ext-link>) to compute the probabilities for each node within the model, resulting in a prior probability diagram.The prior probability diagram indicates that within the constructed Bayesian network, the predicted resilience (PR) of the prefabricated building construction system has a probability of 51.0% of being active. The response resilience (RR) has a probability of 48.6% of being active, the rapid recovery resilience (FR) has a probability of 69.1% of being active, and the learning resilience (LR) has a probability of 69.2% of being active. The overall safety resilience of the prefabricated building construction system has a probability of 65.6% of being active.</p><p id="Par40">Analysis of the prior probability results indicates that the current operational level of safety resilience within existing prefabricated building construction systems is relatively low. Among the four resilience dimensions, rapid recovery resilience (FR) and learning resilience (LR) demonstrate relatively commendable performance. Conversely, response resilience (RR) exhibits the lowest probability of being active (48.6%), signifying that the system&#8217;s resistance capability requires the most significant enhancement.This suggests that, at the current stage, when risk disturbances occur during the implementation of prefabricated building construction, the site demonstrates an ability to respond swiftly to emergent hazardous situations, conduct repairs, and restore work areas to normal operations rapidly. However, the system&#8217;s capacity to resist incidents and disasters is weak; it fails to effectively withstand initial impacts. Consequently, enhancements to the system&#8217;s robustness, redundancy, and managerial agility are imperative.Furthermore, the probability of predicted resilience (PR) being active is also comparatively low (51.0%). This implies that the system inadequately perceives changes in its internal and external environment. Its ability to proactively identify vulnerabilities within subsystems prior to the occurrence of natural disasters or safety incidents, and implement preemptive protective measures to mitigate the likelihood or severity of system damage, is insufficient.</p><p id="Par41">Analysis of the intermediate nodes reveals the following within the Predicted Resilience (PR) module, The probability of the root node PRW1 being active is 40.7%. This indicates inadequate on-site inspection of material storage practices, necessitating regular checks of materials awaiting use.The probability of PRF3 being active is only 35.5%. This signifies insufficient crisis awareness among project management personnel, resulting in a failure to strictly conduct mandatory expert reviews for specially designated construction plans involving significant hazards beyond a certain scale, as stipulated by regulations.The probability of PRF4 being active is 49.3%. This points to inadequate implementation of policies concerning the improvement of emergency rescue management systems within project departments. Consequently, prompt rescue and response efforts cannot be initiated immediately following a safety incident.However, the probability of PRR1 being active is significantly high at 92.8%. This demonstrates that all construction units place strong emphasis on fostering safety awareness among both management and operational personnel.</p><p id="Par42">Analysis within the Response Resilience (RR) module reveals the following, The probability of the root node RRR3 being active is only 35.0%. This indicates that the technical proficiency of on-site operational personnel requires improvement, as a significant proportion of safety incidents stem from workers&#8217; unfamiliarity with operating machinery and equipment.The probability of RRW2 being active is merely 33.6%. This signifies insufficient investment by construction units in safety protection facilities, which severely endangers the lives of on-site workers and inspection personnel.Calculation results demonstrate that the probabilities of influencing factors being active across the system&#8217;s response resilience are generally not high. This indicates room for improvement to varying degrees in all aspects of the system&#8217;s capacity to resist risks.</p><p id="Par43">Analysis of Rapid Recovery (FR) and Learning (LR) Resilience Modules.</p><p id="Par44">The overall probabilities of factors being active within both the Rapid Recovery Resilience (FR) and Learning Resilience (LR) modules are generally adequate.Notably, the probability of the root node FRR2 being active is 59.4%. This further underscores the critical importance of on-site management personnel&#8217;s experience and competence &#8211; specifically, their ability to effectively organize and execute subsequent rescue, relief, and post-incident recovery operations following accident damage.</p><p id="Par45">Overall, the probabilities of PRR1, PRF2, and FRF1 being active exceed 80%. This indicates that significant attention is currently being paid by construction units to the following factors during prefabricated building construction: personnel safety awareness, project-specific safety production education and training, and targeted investment in safe and civilized construction practices. However, the probability values for the activation of the remaining root nodes in the network fall within the range of 50&#8211;80%. This signifies that considerable room for improvement exists for numerous safety resilience influencing factors within the prefabricated building construction process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Analysis of posterior probability diagnostic reasoning in bayesian networks</title><p id="Par46">The functionality of Bayesian networks in diagnostic reasoning lies in their capacity to inferentially calculate the probability of occurrence for each node. This is achieved by analyzing the impact of the known probability of a specific node occurring on the probability changes of other related nodes, demonstrating their efficacy in providing decision support under uncertain conditions. This tool enables reverse inference, tracing from known outcomes back to potential causes. It is extensively applied in critical domains such as risk quantification, intelligent decision-making, and anomaly detection. Through iterative feedback and refinement, users can significantly enhance model performance, thereby furnishing more precise and reliable data support for the decision-making process. For instance, in the Netica 6.08(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.norsys.com/netica.html">https://www.norsys.com/netica.html</ext-link>), setting the probability of the &#8220;not activated&#8221; state for leaf nodes to 100% yields the posterior probability maps.</p><p id="Par47">In the Predictive Resilience (PR) module, when the probability of failure for the safety resilience of the prefabricated construction engineering system is set to 100%, the probability of failure for the safety inspection of material stacking at location PRW1 increased from 59.3 to 62.7%, representing a 3.4% increase. This node exhibited the largest magnitude change within the module, signifying that it demonstrates the highest volatility among all assessed parameters. These changes in probability values indicate this node is the most unstable contributor in the system.This analysis demonstrates that enhancing the frequency of regular safety inspections for material stacking constitutes a highly effective preventive measure for both identifying potential hazards and mitigating associated risks, enabling the proactive forecasting of potential safety incidents. To effectively manage this critical vulnerability, project leadership should Intensify the frequency of routine safety production meetings and heighten safety awareness among personnel responsible for safety management and material handling.In addition, project leaders should implement standardized and regular inspection protocols for the storage conditions of all delivered materials.</p><p id="Par48">In the Response Resilience (RR) module, when the probability of failure for the safety resilience of the prefabricated construction engineering system is set to 100%, the probability of failureassociated with the operational skill level of workers at location RRR3 increased from 65.0 to 66.1%. This represents an increase of 1.1% points and constitutes the most significant probabilistic variation observed among all nodes within this module.This finding underscores that enhancing the operational skill level of the workforce presents a critical challenge. Insufficient proficiency coupled with a lack of experience in handling diverse contingencies substantially elevates the risk of precipitating mechanical hazardsduring practical operations.To address this vulnerability, project management must mandate strict compliance from subcontractors responsible for prefabricated component manufacturing and on-site personnel by ensuring Comprehensive development and implementation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for every piece of heavy machinery and rigorous verification that all workers demonstrate thorough mastery and consistent application of these procedures.</p><p id="Par49">In the Fast Recovery (FR) module, when the probability of failure for the safety resilience of the prefabricated construction engineering system is set to 100%, the probability of failureassociated with the psychological resilience of workers at location FRR1 increased from 30.7 to 33.0%. This represents a rise of 2.3% points, constituting the most substantial probabilistic shift observed among all nodes within this module.The psychological resilience of the workforce&#8212;specifically, their capacity to promptly control hazardous situations and prevent escalation of casualties and losses&#8212;is a critical determinantin whether the project can achieve timely recovery from risk disruptions. Consequently, enhancing workers&#8217; psychological resilience yields significant improvements in overall system resilience. This necessitates implementing specialized skill training and psychological counseling for workers during the initial phases of engineering projects.Given that human factors represent the paramount element in management systems, it is imperative to effectively mobilize all human resources. Resilience building must transcend traditional top-down approaches by activating the subjective initiative of every worker. This requires a dual focus Training in operational competencies and cultivating risk response capabilities.This dual strategy ensures that frontline personnel encountering emergent hazards can rapidly curb the propagation of risks.</p><p id="Par50">In the Learning Resilience (LR) module, when the probability of failure for the safety resilience of the prefabricated construction engineering system is set to 100%, the probability of failureassociated with the proactive enhancement of personnel safety awareness at location LRR1 increased from 33.0 to 39.8%, representing a significant rise of 6.8% points.Consequently, the proactive enhancement of safety awareness constitutes the most direct mechanism for improving learning resilience. This process requires both project management personnel and operational workers to critically reflect on incidents following safety events, internalize lessons learned, and implement corrective measures to prevent recurrence of similar safety incidents, thereby systematically strengthening organizational learning resilience.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Sensitivity analysis of predictive resilience</title><p id="Par51">According to Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>, the sensitivity of the 10 safety resilience influencing factors in predicting resilience is as follows: PRW1&gt; PRF3&gt; PRF1&gt; PRH1&gt; PRW2&gt; PRJ1&gt; PRF4&gt; PRF2&gt; PRW3&gt; PRR1, That is, its impact on predicting toughness PR decreases in order. Therefore, the factors that exert the greatest influence on predicting resilience are the safety inspection of PRW1 material stacking and the expert review of the PRF3 special construction plan. OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the United States), HSE (Health and Safety Executive in the United Kingdom), and China&#8217;s &#8220;Standard for Safety Management of Construction Site&#8221; all provide extensive details on the requirements for stacking height, spacing, and support of various materials (such as steel bars, blocks, and formwork). The existence of these mandatory provisions is itself an acknowledgment by the industry of the high importance of the risk point of &#8220;material stacking&#8221;. Elevating the &#8220;PRW1&#8221; node from an analytical variable to the level of mandatory enforcement by regulations demonstrates its fundamental status. Standards worldwide (such as China&#8217;s &#8220;Regulations on Safety Management of High-Risk Divisional and Sub-divisional Works&#8221;) all mandate the preparation of specialized construction plans and the organization of expert demonstrations. The regulations explicitly make &#8220;expert demonstration&#8221; a prerequisite for the commencement of such projects, which directly confirms that &#8220;expert demonstration of specialized construction plans (PRF3)&#8221; is a key decision node in preventing systemic collapse. Therefore, it is highly reasonable to consider PRW1 (safety inspection of material stacking) and PRF3 (expert demonstration of specialized construction plans) as the most critical root nodes for predicting safety resilience.The project department should place special emphasis on material management and the review of construction plans for sub-divisional works with high risks, in order to mitigate safety risks at their source.</p><p id="Par52">

The factors that have the greatest impact on response resilience are the operational skill level of RRR3 operators and the configuration of safety protection facilities for RRW2 projects. In human factors engineering and resilience engineering, &#8220;human skills&#8221; and &#8220;adaptive capacity&#8221; are repeatedly emphasized as the cornerstones of system responsiveness. Numerous studies have demonstrated that humans are the most flexible and intelligent element in the response process, and their technical proficiency directly determines the quality and speed of response actions. Furthermore, safety protection facilities serve as physical barriers that absorb energy, isolate hazards, and buy time for human response, forming the &#8220;material foundation&#8221; of response resilience. They provide crucial fault tolerance space and are a prerequisite for the system to bounce back from disturbances. Therefore, RRR3 (human) represents the &#8220;active core&#8221; of response resilience, while RRW2 (physical) represents the &#8220;passive cornerstone&#8221; of response resilience. It is highly reasonable to consider these two factors as the most critical in influencing response resilience.The project department must simultaneously enhance the development of personnel and increase investment in resources to maximize the project&#8217;s emergency response capability.</p><p id="Par54">

The most significant factor influencing the rapid recovery of resilience is the psychological quality of FRR1 operators. Previous research on resilience restoration has emphasized more on hardware repair, resource scheduling, process optimization, etc. This study innovatively proposes that &#8220;the psychological quality of personnel is a more important &#8216;catalyst&#8217; than hardware, technology, or even contingency plans.&#8221; Because the psychological state of personnel is the &#8220;software&#8221; and &#8220;operating system&#8221; that initiates and accelerates all physical restoration work. Ensuring &#8220;psychological safety&#8221; and &#8220;mental health&#8221; is the prerequisite for carrying out any effective physical restoration, which echoes the core viewpoint of disaster psychology. The judgment or choice made by a worker with good psychological quality in an emergency situation is crucial for promptly controlling the dangerous situation and preventing it from escalating further.Therefore, FRR1 (the psychological quality of operating personnel) is the most critical factor affecting rapid resilience restoration&#8212;a very advanced and reasonable conclusion. While enterprises focus on processes and hardware, they must also invest in the inner strength of people.</p><p id="Par56">

The sensitivity of predicting resilience PR is the highest, which means its impact on the safety resilience SR of prefabricated building engineering systems is the greatest.Traditional cast-in-place construction allows for extensive adjustments and modifications on-site, whereas the components of prefabricated buildings, once completed in the factory, have fixed dimensions, joints, embedded parts, etc. If design conflicts or lifting point issues are discovered on-site, they are almost impossible to resolve on the spot and can only be returned to the factory or scrapped, resulting in significant losses and safety risks. The unique &#8220;front-end decision-making, back-end execution&#8221; model of prefabricated buildings determines that their safety performance is almost &#8220;predestined&#8221; before construction begins. In traditional cast-in-place buildings, the weight of &#8220;response toughness&#8221; may be relatively high, while prefabricated buildings rely more on &#8220;prediction.&#8221; Therefore, in prefabricated building projects, the impact of predictive toughness (PR) on the overall system safety toughness (SR) is of great rationality and practical significance.Project decision-makers should allocate more resources and energy to safety reviews during the design phase, in-depth argumentation of construction plans, and strict control over the supply chain, to achieve a strategic transformation from &#8220;passive response&#8221; to &#8220;active foresight&#8221;. Only in this way can the overall safety resilience of the project be maximized. Furthermore, prefabricated construction enterprises should regard predictive resilience as the core pillar of modernizing their safety management systems, viewing it as an important strategic investment rather than a mere cost expenditure.</p><p id="Par60">

Regarding safety inspections of material stacking, the project department should establish a management organizational system and management regulations, clarify responsible entities and job responsibilities, arrange full-time safety management personnel to conduct on-site inspections according to safety management regulations, and track and recheck potential safety hazards throughout the entire process. For expert verification of specialized construction plans, it is necessary to strictly control the expert members, approval, and execution processes of the verification, ensuring that the content of the specialized plan is complete and feasible, that the calculation sheets, verification bases, and construction drawings in the specialized plan comply with standards and specifications, and that the specialized construction plan can fit the actual situation on site.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par64">To enhance response resilience, the focus should be on the operational skill level of workers and the configuration of project safety protection facilities. To improve the operational skill level of workers, the project department should attach importance to pre-job training and continuing education, allowing workers to be familiar with laws and regulations, technical standards, and normative documents, and to master various safety operation procedures and protective measures. At the same time, dynamic safety supervision should be implemented in combination with information technology such as the Internet of Things. For project safety protection facilities, the construction of prefabricated building projects and the construction of safety protection facilities should be carried out simultaneously and strictly implemented. In the event of a safety accident, safety protection facilities will minimize the casualty rate and direct economic losses to the greatest extent;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par65">To enhance the resilience of rapid recovery, it is crucial to focus on improving the psychological quality of the operating personnel. The project department can regularly organize emergency drills for various risk scenarios and invite technical personnel or safety experts with rich operational experience to demonstrate on site, Regularly conduct psychological resilience training and stress test simulations, strengthen psychological construction, and calmly respond to unexpected risks.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par66">To enhance learning resilience, it is crucial to focus on the self-improvement of personnel&#8217;s safety awareness. The project department should enhance workers&#8217; safety awareness and alertness to potential risks. In practical work, workers should be encouraged to proactively identify hazards or conduct risk assessments for their work.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par67">Based on the theory of safety resilience, this study enriches the dimensions of safety management research in prefabricated construction engineering and provides new ideas for analyzing and effectively controlling safety risks in prefabricated buildings. However, there are still limitations in the research. (1)given the challenges of data collection in prefabricated construction projects, this study adopted the method of designing a questionnaire to estimate the parameters required to construct a Bayesian network. This process is inevitably constrained by the personal biases of experts. In future research, integrating historical monitoring data will enable a more precise evaluation of resilience indicators, thus providing a more objective and comprehensive quantitative method.(2)Although the BN structure in this study is grounded in a robust theoretical framework, the causal relationships it presents are primarily theory-driven, rather than purely data-driven. The role of CFA is to verify that observed variables can reliably represent underlying concepts, thus laying a solid foundation for constructing the BN model. Future research could collect data at different time points to more rigorously test these causal paths, or employ experimental methods to manipulate key variables to provide stronger causal evidence.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Author Contributions: Conceptualization, X.S. and Z.L.; methodology, X.S.; software, Z.L.; data curation, Z.L. and Y.L.; writing&#8212;original draft, Z.L.; writing&#8212;review and editing, X.S. and Y.L.; visualization, Z.L. and Y.L.; supervision, X.S.
